ëIt pains our soulsí: Venezuelans react to first video of relatives in Salvadoran prison after Matt Gaetz TV report,"Sitting on a couch in her home in Maracay, Venezuela, Mirelis Cacique LÛpez watches her son Francisco Javier GarcÌa Cacique on her cell phone in the first video released of a group of Venezuelans sent by the United States to El Salvadorís maximum-security prison Cecot.

ìAmong the boys, I recognized my son,î Cacique LÛpez said to CNN. ìWe thank God for allowing us to see our relatives, even in those conditions,î she added, insisting that she will continue to pray for their release.

The video aired Tuesday on the One America News Network, on a show hosted by former US Republican congressman Matt Gaetz. He visited Cecot and had access to the prison wing housing the group of more than 200 Venezuelans deported by President Donald Trumpís administration, many under the controversial use of the Alien Enemies Act, accused largely without evidence of being members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.

The report shows a roughly one-minute clip of the Venezuelans behind bars, dressed in white T-shirts and shorts, the Cecot prisonersí uniform. From the moment the TV cameras enter the prison, the detainees react with shouts of ìFreedom, freedom!î and ìVenezuela!î while another group makes a fist with four fingers over their thumbs, a universal gesture asking of help.

Yenni Luz RincÛn RamÌrez identified her brother Jonathan Miguel RamÌrez in the video. ìI felt joy because I was finally able to see him after 60 days,î she told CNN from Venezuela. She insisted that her brotherís detention is unjust and asserted that he is not a member of Tren de Aragua.

RincÛn RamÌrez isnít the only one whoís been able to see a loved one for the first time since the deportations were announced in March.Blanca MartÌnez told CNN that she learned her partner Miguel ¡ngel Rojas had been deported to El Salvador through a list published by media outlets. She hadnít heard from him since. So far, neither the US nor the Salvadoran government has published official lists with the names of those deported to Cecot.

ìIt made me sad to see him there without knowing how he really is,î MartÌnez said, adding that Rojas suffers from depression and that knowing he is detained at Cecot causes her great anguish.

Angie RÌos, a US citizen, told CNN in a telephone interview that she recognized her husband Jes˙s RÌos in the video. ìI saw him and I heard him,î she said. ìHeís the most handsome of all,î she said affectionately about her partner. RÌos added the last time she saw her husband was on March 15. ìHeís in survival mode,î RÌos said when she saw Jes˙s, saying he was one of the detainees shouting ìFreedom!î

ìI feel like in that video heís fighting for his voice to be heard.î

CNN has not been able to verify whether these individuals have criminal records in the US and has contacted the Department of Homeland Security for comment.

Following the release of the video, Venezuelan President Nicol·s Maduro again condemned what he considers to be a kidnapping of Venezuelan citizens to El Salvador.

ìI swear that we will rescue the 253 Venezuelans kidnapped in El Salvador, in concentration camps, as seen today,î he said on Tuesday. ìLet us demand that these young people who are kidnapped without trial, without the right to appear before a judge, without the right to a defense, without having committed any crime, be released immediately. And we are ready to pick them up on a Venezuelan plane and bring them back to their families,î he added.

CNN has reached out to the Salvadoran presidency for comment on Maduroís statements.

In April, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele proposed to Maduro an exchange of people deported to and detained in his country and for what he considers ìpolitical prisonersî of the Venezuelan government. Maduro responded by demanding access to the prisoners for lawyers and family members.

In March, El Salvador agreed to detain in Cecot up to 300 immigrants sent by the Trump administration. El Salvador would receive approximately $6 million from the US to hold them there, according to an agreement between the two governments.",15-May-25,World,"Ana Melgar, Caroll Alvarado",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/14/americas/venezuela-salvador-prison-video-intl-latam-hnk,,,,,,,,,,,,sitting couch home maracay venezuela mirelis cacique l√≥pez watches son francisco javier garc√≠a cacique cell phone first video released group venezuelans sent united states el salvador‚Äôs maximumsecurity prison cecot ‚Äúamong boys recognized son‚Äù cacique l√≥pez said cnn ‚Äúwe thank god allowing us see relatives even conditions‚Äù added insisting continue pray release video aired tuesday one america news network show hosted former us republican congressman matt gaetz visited cecot access prison wing housing group venezuelans deported president donald trump‚Äôs administration many controversial use alien enemies act accused largely without evidence members venezuelan gang tren de aragua report shows roughly oneminute clip venezuelans behind bars dressed white tshirts shorts cecot prisoners‚Äô uniform moment tv cameras enter prison detainees react shouts ‚Äúfreedom freedom‚Äù ‚Äúvenezuela‚Äù another group makes fist four fingers thumbs universal gesture asking help yenni luz rinc√≥n ram√≠rez identified brother jonathan miguel ram√≠rez video ‚Äúi felt joy finally able see days‚Äù told cnn venezuela insisted brother‚Äôs detention unjust asserted member tren de aragua rinc√≥n ram√≠rez isn‚Äôt one who‚Äôs able see loved one first time since deportations announced marchblanca mart√≠nez told cnn learned partner miguel √°ngel rojas deported el salvador list published media outlets hadn‚Äôt heard since far neither us salvadoran government published official lists names deported cecot ‚Äúit made sad see without knowing really is‚Äù mart√≠nez said adding rojas suffers depression knowing detained cecot causes great anguish angie r√≠os us citizen told cnn telephone interview recognized husband jes√∫s r√≠os video ‚Äúi saw heard him‚Äù said ‚Äúhe‚Äôs handsome all‚Äù said affectionately partner r√≠os added last time saw husband march ‚Äúhe‚Äôs survival mode‚Äù r√≠os said saw jes√∫s saying one detainees shouting ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù ‚Äúi feel like video he‚Äôs fighting voice heard‚Äù cnn able verify whether individuals criminal records us contacted department homeland security comment following release video venezuelan president nicol√°s maduro condemned considers kidnapping venezuelan citizens el salvador ‚Äúi swear rescue venezuelans kidnapped el salvador concentration camps seen today‚Äù said tuesday ‚Äúlet us demand young people kidnapped without trial without right appear judge without right defense without committed crime released immediately ready pick venezuelan plane bring back families‚Äù added cnn reached salvadoran presidency comment maduro‚Äôs statements april salvadoran president nayib bukele proposed maduro exchange people deported detained country considers ‚Äúpolitical prisoners‚Äù venezuelan government maduro responded demanding access prisoners lawyers family members march el salvador agreed detain cecot immigrants sent trump administration el salvador receive approximately million us hold according agreement two governments
"A US-backed group says it will deliver aid to Gaza, but humanitarian organizations are skeptical. Here's what we know","A controversial new American-backed organization, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), has announced it will begin delivering aid to the besieged territory within two weeks and says it has Israelís approval.

The move would provide some relief for Gazans facing acute hunger from 19 months of war and a two-and-half month Israeli blockade of all food, water, medical and humanitarian supplies.

More than half of Gazaís population faces ìemergencyî or ìcatastrophicî levels of hunger, according to a UN-backed panel considered an authority on the matter.


But the foundation has come under significant criticism from top humanitarian officials, who warn that it is insufficient, could endanger civilians and even encourage their forced displacement.

Hereís what we know about the new aid mechanism.

Why is Israel blocking food from entering Gaza?
Israel started a total blockade on Gaza on March 2, the day after the initial phase of a ceasefire with Hamas expired.Officials said their goal was to force the group to accept new ceasefire terms and release hostages taken from Israel on October 7, 2023.

Israel and the United States have also accused Hamas of stealing aid intended for Gazaís civilian population. Hamas has rejected those claims, and humanitarian aid organizations say the overwhelming majority of food aid reaches civilians in need.Whatever the motivation, the impact is clear.

The hunger crisis long predates Israelís total blockade. Since Hamasí attack, Israel has severely restricted the amount of aid that can enter Gaza. And even before October 2023, Israel and Egypt had imposed a partial blockade on Gaza, meaning that 63% of the population was food insecure. 

Now that figure is 100%, according to the World Food Programme (WFP). It says that 70,000 children need urgent treatment for ìacute malnutrition.î

What is the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation?
Itís a non-profit set up at the urging of the American government to help alleviate hunger in Gaza, while complying with Israeli demands that the aid not reach Hamas.

The American ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, laid out some of the goals for the organization in a press conference in Jerusalem last week.Where would the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation get its food and money?
Itís unclear.

In its announcement this week, the GHF said that it was ìin the final stages of procuring large volumes of food aid to supplement existing pledges from humanitarian organizations operating in Gaza.î It said that that would equate to more than 300 million meals.

It did not list the suppliers.

Huckabee told reporters last week that ìthere are some people who have already committed to helping fundî but that ìthey donít want to be disclosed as of yet.î",15-May-25,World,Mick Krever,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/15/middleeast/gaza-humanitarian-foundation-aid-israel-intl,,,,,,,,,,,,controversial new americanbacked organization gaza humanitarian foundation ghf announced begin delivering aid besieged territory within two weeks says israel‚Äôs approval move provide relief gazans facing acute hunger months war twoandhalf month israeli blockade food water medical humanitarian supplies half gaza‚Äôs population faces ‚Äúemergency‚Äù ‚Äúcatastrophic‚Äù levels hunger according unbacked panel considered authority matter foundation come significant criticism top humanitarian officials warn insufficient endanger civilians even encourage forced displacement here‚Äôs know new aid mechanism israel blocking food entering gaza israel started total blockade gaza march day initial phase ceasefire hamas expiredofficials said goal force group accept new ceasefire terms release hostages taken israel october israel united states also accused hamas stealing aid intended gaza‚Äôs civilian population hamas rejected claims humanitarian aid organizations say overwhelming majority food aid reaches civilians needwhatever motivation impact clear hunger crisis long predates israel‚Äôs total blockade since hamas‚Äô attack israel severely restricted amount aid can enter gaza even october israel egypt imposed partial blockade gaza meaning population food insecure now figure according world food programme wfp says children need urgent treatment ‚Äúacute malnutrition‚Äù gaza humanitarian foundation it‚Äôs nonprofit set urging american government help alleviate hunger gaza complying israeli demands aid reach hamas american ambassador israel mike huckabee laid goals organization press conference jerusalem last weekwhere gaza humanitarian foundation get food money it‚Äôs unclear announcement week ghf said ‚Äúin final stages procuring large volumes food aid supplement existing pledges humanitarian organizations operating gaza‚Äù said equate million meals list suppliers huckabee told reporters last week ‚Äúthere people already committed helping fund‚Äù ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt want disclosed yet‚Äù
Trump says US is ëvery closeí to a nuclear deal after Iran ëagreedí to its terms,"US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that Washington is ìvery closeî to reaching a nuclear deal with Iran after Tehran ìsort ofî agreed to its terms.

ìIran has sort of agreed to the terms: Theyíre not going to make, I call it, in a friendly way, nuclear dust. Weíre not going to be making any nuclear dust in Iran,î he said.

Iranian officials havenít publicly commented on Trumpís remarks, though the comments were reported by the countryís semi-official ISNA news agency. CNN has requested a comment from Iranís mission to the United Nations.

Speaking at a business roundtable in the Qatari capital Doha, Trump reiterated that Iran ìcanít have a nuclear weaponî and suggested that negotiators are ìgetting very close to maybe doing a deal.îDuring his Gulf tour, Trump has repeatedly warned that Iran must never obtain a nuclear weapon, threatening to strike the country if it fails to reach a nuclear deal. But he has not explicitly ruled out Iran enriching uranium on its own soil. While uranium is used as a nuclear fuel, it can be weaponized if enriched to high levels.In an interview with Breitbart last week, US foreign envoy Steve Witkoff said that an enrichment program in Iran is a ìred lineî for the US. In an earlier interview with Fox News, he had suggested that Iran could be allowed to enrich uranium to low levels.

Several rounds of talks have taken place between the US and Iran, but the most recent one in the Omani capital Muscat last weekend was described by the Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson as ìdifficult.î

A senior Trump administration official gave a more positive assessment, telling CNN the discussions, which lasted over three hours, were encouraging.

Global oil prices fell after Trumpís comments. The price of a barrel of Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, fell over 3% Thursday morning to $64 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate, the US oil benchmark, was trading down 3.5% to almost $61 a barrel around the same time.

ëWe are going to protect this countryí
It is unclear what Trump meant by ìnuclear dust,î but Gulf states, including Qatar, are concerned that an attack on Iranís nuclear facilities could cause an environmental catastrophe in the region and drag them into a wider regional war.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian lambasted the threatening remarks by Trump.

The US president ìis naive for thinking that he can come to our region, threaten us, and hope that we back down against his demands,î Pezeshkian told a group of academics during a gathering in Kermanshah Province on Wednesday, according to the Iranian media. ìWe will never negotiate our dignity. This is in the blood of every Iranian,î

ìYou have tried to bring Iran to its knees for the past 47 years. We have existed for thousands of years and will continue as one for the years to come,î he said.

On Wednesday, Trump repeated his threats, saying he doesnít want nuclear talks in Iran to take a ìviolent course.î

ìTwo courses, thereís only two courses. There arenít three or four or five, thereís two. Thereís a friendly and a non-friendly, and non-friendly is a violent course, and I donít want that. Iíll say it up front. I donít want that, but they have to get moving,î the president said.

Speaking in Doha, Trump vowed to ìprotectî Qatar.

ìFor this country in particular, because youíre right next door, youíre a stoneís throw away, not even, right? Youíre a foot away. You can walk right into Iran. Other countries are much further away, so probably itís not quite the same level of danger, but we are going to protect this country, this very special place with a special royal family,î he said.",15-May-25,World,"Betsy Klein, Nadeen Ebrahim",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/15/middleeast/trump-us-close-nuclear-deal-iran-intl,,,,,,,,,,,,us president donald trump said thursday washington ‚Äúvery close‚Äù reaching nuclear deal iran tehran ‚Äúsort of‚Äù agreed terms ‚Äúiran sort agreed terms they‚Äôre going make call friendly way nuclear dust we‚Äôre going making nuclear dust iran‚Äù said iranian officials haven‚Äôt publicly commented trump‚Äôs remarks though comments reported country‚Äôs semiofficial isna news agency cnn requested comment iran‚Äôs mission united nations speaking business roundtable qatari capital doha trump reiterated iran ‚Äúcan‚Äôt nuclear weapon‚Äù suggested negotiators ‚Äúgetting close maybe deal‚Äùduring gulf tour trump repeatedly warned iran must never obtain nuclear weapon threatening strike country fails reach nuclear deal explicitly ruled iran enriching uranium soil uranium used nuclear fuel can weaponized enriched high levelsin interview breitbart last week us foreign envoy steve witkoff said enrichment program iran ‚Äúred line‚Äù us earlier interview fox news suggested iran allowed enrich uranium low levels several rounds talks taken place us iran recent one omani capital muscat last weekend described iranian foreign ministry spokesperson ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù senior trump administration official gave positive assessment telling cnn discussions lasted three hours encouraging global oil prices fell trump‚Äôs comments price barrel brent crude global oil benchmark fell thursday morning barrel west texas intermediate us oil benchmark trading almost barrel around time ‚Äòwe going protect country‚Äô unclear trump meant ‚Äúnuclear dust‚Äù gulf states including qatar concerned attack iran‚Äôs nuclear facilities cause environmental catastrophe region drag wider regional wariranian president masoud pezeshkian lambasted threatening remarks trump us president ‚Äúis naive thinking can come region threaten us hope back demands‚Äù pezeshkian told group academics gathering kermanshah province wednesday according iranian media ‚Äúwe never negotiate dignity blood every iranian‚Äù ‚Äúyou tried bring iran knees past years existed thousands years continue one years come‚Äù said wednesday trump repeated threats saying doesn‚Äôt want nuclear talks iran take ‚Äúviolent course‚Äù ‚Äútwo courses there‚Äôs two courses aren‚Äôt three four five there‚Äôs two there‚Äôs friendly nonfriendly nonfriendly violent course don‚Äôt want i‚Äôll say front don‚Äôt want get moving‚Äù president said speaking doha trump vowed ‚Äúprotect‚Äù qatar ‚Äúfor country particular you‚Äôre right next door you‚Äôre stone‚Äôs throw away even right you‚Äôre foot away can walk right iran countries much away probably it‚Äôs quite level danger going protect country special place special royal family‚Äù said
"ëOur Russian Town!í Content creators paint a rosy picture of life in occupied Mariupol, with support from the Kremlin","Three years after it seized control of Mariupol following a brutal 86-day siege, Russia is using a more subtle power to keep its grip on the Ukrainian port city: social media influencers.

A CNN investigation found that residents of the occupied city, including schoolchildren, are being trained in new media programs and ìblogger schoolsî with ties to the Russian state.

Though their follower counts and overall reach pale in comparison to celebrity influencers, experts say that the Kremlin needs local voices to effectively promote life under Russiaís rule.

ìJust look what Russia is getting up to in Mariupol,î Pavel Karbovsky, a teacher at one of the blogger schools, said in a recent TikTok video highlighting the construction of new apartment buildings. ìWait, theyíre building, not demolishingÖ this is Mariupol, our Russian town!î

Karbovsky is among a growing number of content creators painting a picture of renewal in cities and towns across the four Ukrainian regions illegally annexed by Russia in 2022 ñ Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. He said he is not operating as a propagandist. Instead, his mission is ìto show the truthî about life in Russian-occupied areas, he told CNN in a video interview from Donetsk.But Russian-backed occupation officials have been actively encouraging creators like Karbovksy to post about the restoration of the ìliberatedî territories, including in official meetings.

In January, Karbovsky was among a group of content creators invited to meet with Denis Pushilin, the Russian-backed head of the Donetsk Peopleís Republic (DPR). Pushilin said in a statement on Telegram that he was ìcountingî on the group to spread the word that the eastern Donbas region was ìbeing revived.î

ìWe are all united by an immense desire to restore and revive Donbas. And people should know as much information as possible about the large-scale work that is already underway,î the post continued.

CNN analyzed over a dozen profiles of local influencers promoting Moscowís Russification project in Mariupol on social media platforms, some of which are openly pro-Russia and blame Ukraine for the pain inflicted on the region, while others appear apolitical. Despite their modest audiences ñ ranging from 3,000 to 36,000 on TikTok ñ their reconstruction-focused content can garner hundreds of thousands of views.

But absent from their videos is any context on the reason for rebuilding.

Russiaís siege of the port city, once known as a hub for trade and manufacturing, was one of the deadliest and most destructive battles since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago.

According to United Nations estimates, 90% of residential buildings were damaged or destroyed in Mariupol during Russian attacks, and around 350,000 people out of the pre-war population of about 430,000 were forced to flee. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a recent interview that 20,000 civilians are believed to have been killed, though the death toll is impossible to verify. Ukrainian officials accused Moscow of trying to cover up evidence of civilian casualties, a claim the Kremlin denies.ìMoscow seeks to interrupt the flow of information about the terrible destruction brought by the Russian army,î Ihor Solovey, director of the Ukrainian governmentís Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security, said in written comments to CNN. To counter this, he said, Ukraine is trying to ìconvey even more facts about the crimes of the occupiers,î adding that ìthere are more than enough of them to completely refute any Russian fakes about the ëbeautiful lifeí under occupation.î

For Moscow, maintaining control of Mariupol remains a strategic priority and a focus of significant investment. ìWe are paying a lot of attention to Mariupol,î Russian President Vladimir Putin said during his annual press conference in December. In March 2023, he staged a highly choreographed trip to the city, discussing ìrestorationî efforts with local officials. In a video that circulated online of him meeting residents, a voice off-camera could be heard shouting: ìItís all lies, itís just for show.îWhile construction is clearly ongoing, CNNís analysis of satellite imagery, interviews with residents and videos posted to social media show significant destruction remains. Many who lost their homes in 2022 have not been rehoused and the quality of new housing is often inadequate. Residents say Russian authorities are also seizing homes from Ukrainians who fled the city to give to others.

ìThey have created a kind of Potemkin pictureÖ But people donít live there, in many houses, they donít live there,î one Mariupol resident said, referencing the fake villages built by Grigory Potemkin in 18th-century Russia to impress Catherine the Great. He spoke to CNN anonymously for fear of reprisals.

CNN has reached out to the Russian-backed mayor of Mariupol and the Russian government for comment on the claims.

Training new voices
In September, an organization called the Donbass Media Centre (DMC) opened its ìblogger schoolî in Mariupol. It offers free two-week courses designed to give aspiring influencers a technical grounding in skills like filming and editing, as well as an understanding of how to gain popularity and make money online.Similar courses had already been held in Donetsk and Luhansk, and another followed in Melitopol, in the Russian-occupied part of Zaporizhzhia. Karbovsky was one of the teachers.

ìI know how to gather views, make content so I was invited to teach kids between 16 and 22,î he told CNN. Neither Karbovsky, nor the schoolís coordinator would tell CNN who finances the program, but it appears to have the tacit support of the Russian government.The DMC was set up by Donbass Media, a pro-Russian news channel mostly operating on social media. In 2024, the DMC won a Runet Prize, a national award of the Russian Federation and Presidential Foundation for Cultural Initiatives that celebrates excellence on the Russian internet. It also has a partnership with ìTop Blog,î a competition for content creators run by a Kremlin program called ìRussia - Land of Opportunities.î Last year, the most successful DMC students won a trip to Moscow to visit the headquarters of Vkontakte, Russiaís version of Facebook.

Vkontakte is among several Russian social media networks owned by state-run Gazprom-Media. The Kremlin has clamped down its control of social media in recent years, through ownership, internet slowdowns, and, more recently, legislation requiring influencers with over 10,000 followers to register their personal details with Russiaís media regulator, Roskomnadzor.

Karbovsky said the DMCís aims are not political. ìDMC does not have any such goal to create some sort of propagandists ñ no way. We donít need this,î he said. ìWe want people to be able to share their different views about what is happening in the DPR (Donetsk Peopleís Republic) and the LPR (Luhansk Peopleís Republic) and other regions.î

The same month the DMC opened its ìblogger schoolî in Mariupol, graduates of a Russian government program called ìThe New Media Workshopî opened a media center in Mariupol to teach schoolchildren 14- to 17-years-old photography, filming and how ìto work in the social networks.î The free program is funded in part by a Russian presidential grant worth around $12,000. Participants are encouraged to show the positive side of Mariupol.

ìWe look forward to welcoming talented kids, so together we can talk about the life of our beloved city,î reads an October Telegram post from the media center. In another, a participant in the course interviews children about how Mariupol has changed. ìItís become much more interesting, more colorful,î says one young girl. ìItís developing quickly,î her friend adds.In March, Rutube ñ an alternative to YouTube owned by Russiaís Gazprom-Media ñ announced it was setting up ìstudiosî in cities and towns across the four annexed regions, including in Mariupol, where content creators could access high-tech equipment and training programs. The initiative is part of a joint project with the Russian Military Historical Society, which Putin created by presidential decree in 2012 to ìcounter attempts to distortî Russiaís military history.

ìThe world now really needs the truth about the lives of the new Russian citizens who have gone through a lotÖ but chose to speak Russian, think and dream in Russian,î one of the organizers said in a press release.

Andrei Soldatov, an expert in Russiaís intelligence services and state surveillance on the internet, says thereís no doubt who is directing these efforts. ìItís top level, itís not regional, itís not decided on the level of say the administrations of the occupied territories. Itís all about the Kremlin,î he told CNN.

Subtle messaging
Most of the social media accounts CNN analyzed started posting after Russiaís invasion and share content with a common theme: portraying Russian revival efforts in Mariupol in a positive light.

ìWhen I heard people say Mariupol was a bad city, that nothingís left of it, I wanted to show that the city is alive, is recovering, and thatís why I started showing what is really happening here,î Elizaveta Chervyakova, a 21-year-old DMC graduate from Mariupol, told CNN in a video interview from the city.

One of her most popular recent videos, with over 177,000 views, is a montage of both damaged and rebuilt buildings in the city set to a voice-over that states: ìMariupol ñ the seaside capital of Southern Russia.î

She told CNN that posting about the regionís recovery is becoming a trend.

ìLook how beautiful,î another content creator, known as ìMasha from Mariupol,î says in a TikTok video showing off newly built apartment blocks at sunset. ìThese apartments are filled with happy peopleÖ a wonderful region for family life.î

In other clips, she poses in front of a war memorial, gives a tour of the reopened railway station and shows off construction at the Drama Theater, where hundreds of civilians were killed in a Russian airstrike.Shiny rooftops of restored, or in some cases newly built, apartment blocks are visible dotted in and around the city center, having mostly replaced buildings destroyed in the war, satellite images from late 2024 show.

But in other areas the scars of the conflict are still visible.

In a satellite image from December last year, a crane can be seen next to the Drama Theater, where the Russian word for children, ????, was scrawled in the spring of 2022 ñ a failed attempt to deter Russian bombs. Russian state media has reported that the theater will be finished this year.

In December, Putin claimed in a press conference that at least 300,000 people had returned to Mariupol and said, ìthe population continues to grow at a rapid pace.î In March, he signed a decree ordering all residents of the four regions to get a Russian passport by September 10 or leave.

Mariupolís Ukrainian exiled mayor, Vadym Boichenko, told CNN that only around 100,000 Ukrainians are estimated to remain in the city ñ including some who left during the siege and have since returned.

Boichenko said he believes Russians are being lured there not only through positive news stories and social media posts, but also by Russiaís preferential 2% mortgage rate for its ìnew territoriesî ñ a significant draw in a country where market rates are currently as high as 29%.

Russia has promised to provide ìcompensatory housingî to everyone affected by the war, but in videos circulating mainly on Telegram, groups of Mariupol residents claim they still have not received their apartments and deliver direct appeals to Putin for homes.

In one video that surfaced in January, some hold up a sign that reads ì?????,î a Russian acronym meaning ìhomeless people.î One person says they are being offered apartments belonging to residents who left Mariupol. ìWe earned our apartments, we donít want other peoples,î she says, urging the authorities to continue building. The Russian-installed mayor of Mariupol has said some residents will be given ìabandonedî properties, effectively stripping those who left the ability to return.",15-May-25,World,"Clare Sebastian,

In pictures: The world mourns Pope Francis,"The death of Pope Francis has triggered a period of mourning across the globe, and tens of thousands of people flocked to the Vatican to pay their respects.

Francis, the first Latin American pope in history, died Monday at the age of 88.

His funeral was held Saturday, and many world leaders attended the ceremony, which took place mostly in St. Peter's Square. Vatican authorities said that more than 250,000 people participated in the service.

After nine days of mourning, all cardinals under the age of 80 will convene in the Vatican to pick Francisí successor.

It typically takes between two and three weeks for a pope to be chosen following the death of his predecessor, though it can stretch slightly beyond that if cardinals struggle to agree on a candidate.",4/27/2025,World,Brett Roegiers,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/21/world/gallery/pope-francis-death-reaction,,,,,,,,,,,,death pope francis triggered period mourning across globe tens thousands people flocked vatican pay respects francis first latin american pope history died monday age funeral held saturday many world leaders attended ceremony took place mostly st peters square vatican authorities said people participated service nine days mourning cardinals age convene vatican pick francis‚Äô successor typically takes two three weeks pope chosen following death predecessor though can stretch slightly beyond cardinals struggle agree candidate
US YouTuber MrBeast sparks controversy by filming at Mexico archaeological sites,"Jimmy Donaldson, better known as MrBeast, is at the center of another controversy, and this time it directly involves Mexico.

MrBeast, who is by far the YouTuber with the most subscribers in the world (surpassing the second-place user by almost 100 million), published a video on May 10th in which he visited some of Mexicoís most important archaeological sites, including ChichÈn Itz· in the state of Yucat·n, home to the Temple of Kukulkan pyramid, known as El Castillo, one of the seven wonders of the modern world.

MrBeast also visited the archaeological sites of Calakmul in the state of Campeche and BalamcanchÈ in Yucat·n.

The video, which as of Wednesday afternoon has accumulated more than 55 million views, shows MrBeast and his team in the surroundings of Kukulkan, but also inside other archaeological structures, in cenotes and temples.

Some of these sites are not permanently accessible to the public, as the Mexican government has acknowledged.

What is the controversy surrounding MrBeast in Mexico?

The controversy centers on the fact that the YouTuber was allowed entry to sites considered sacred to Mexicoís pre-Hispanic cultures, which in many cases are restricted.

In one part of the video, MrBeast himself says: ìI canít believe the government is letting us do this. Itís truly crazy. Not even archaeologists are allowed in here.î

In response to the controversy, the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) ñ an agency attached to the Mexican governmentís Ministry of Culture ñ declared on Monday that both the visit and the recording were carried out through ìformal requests.î

These requests, however, were not made by MrBeast, but rather by ìthe federal Ministry of Tourism and the governments ofî Yucat·n and Campeche, the INAH indicated. In the description of his video, MrBeast claims that the publication is a ìcollaboration with the Mexican Ministry of Tourism.î

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Wednesday that there were permits for the ìbroadcast,î but asked the INAH to report ìunder what conditions this permit was granted.î

ìAnd if the permit was violated, then (it must be determined) what sanctions apply,î the president added.

Other points have also caused controversy, such as a drone shot that appears to be inside the temple at the top of El Castillo in ChichÈn Itz·. Regarding this, the INAH said that this did not occur and that the shot was in fact recorded outside the structure.

There are also scenes where MrBeast appears to descend to the archaeological sites by helicopter or where he holds a pre-Hispanic mask in his hands.

All of this, the INAH says, is either false or was edited after the recording: ìClearly, the video involves extensive audiovisual post-production work and alludes to events that did not occur, such as the fact that the producers never descended from a helicopter, spent the night inside the archaeological site, or possessed a pre-Hispanic mask, as the one presented is clearly a contemporary reproduction. All of these are false assertions that reflect the theatricality of the YouTuber in question.î

How easy is it to apply for permits? Is it true that not even archaeologists can enter, as MrBeast claims?

Exploring, filming, and broadcasting in Mexican archaeological sites is a restricted activity that few are allowed to do.

The INAH stated that, while institute personnel were supervising MrBeastís activities at all times, access was granted to an area that is not permanently accessible to the general public.

ìThe tours were conducted in publicly accessible areas without affecting visitor access. In the case of Calakmul, the substructure of the Structure II was also visited. Although it is not permanently open to the public, it does provide access by arranging a scheduled visit in advance and with justification, as is the case with tours conducted with the communities surrounding the archaeological site,î it said in its Monday statement.

Sheinbaum asked the INAH to provide information on the nature of the permit for the MrBeast video. Until it is announced, its scope and the points it covers are unknown.

However, by law, exploration of Mexicoís archaeological sites is permitted for a very small group of institutions.

In September 2024, the INAH responded to a request for citizen information requesting the ìrequirements and stepsî necessary to enter the Kukulkan pyramid at ChichÈn Itz·.

In this request, the director of the ChichÈn Itz· Archaeological Zone, JosÈ Francisco Javier Osorio LeÛn, mentions that ìin accordanceî with the provisions of the Federal Law on Archaeological, Artistic, and Historical Monuments and Zones, ìall types of material work to discover or explore archaeological monuments will only be carried out by the National Institute of Anthropology and History or by scientific institutions or those of recognized moral standing, with prior authorization.î

Likewise, Article 31 of this law states that the authorizations granted by the INAH must specify ìthe terms and conditions to which the work must be subject, as well as the obligations of those who carry it out.î

While the details of the permits for MrBeastís video are still unknown, the INAH stated that, although the YouTuberís video offers ìdistortedî information, its dissemination ìmay motivate interest among young audiences in Mexico and around the world to learn about our ancestral cultures and visit archaeological sites.î

Meanwhile, Federal Culture Secretary Claudia Curiel de Icaza spoke out against the activities carried out by MrBeast and his team at the archaeological sites.

ìThis isnít the first time this type of incident has happened, and itís been clarified. Of course we donít agree, and of course there will be appropriate sanctions because thatís not what these spaces are for,î Curiel de Icaza said Tuesday at a decorative and utilitarian art event.",5/14/2025,World,Uriel Blanco,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/14/americas/youtuber-mrbeast-controversy-mexico-archaeological-sites-intl-latam,,,,,,,,,,,,jimmy donaldson better known mrbeast center another controversy time directly involves mexico mrbeast far youtuber subscribers world surpassing secondplace user almost million published video may th visited mexico‚Äôs important archaeological sites including chich√©n itz√° state yucat√°n home temple kukulkan pyramid known el castillo one seven wonders modern world mrbeast also visited archaeological sites calakmul state campeche balamcanch√© yucat√°n video wednesday afternoon accumulated million views shows mrbeast team surroundings kukulkan also inside archaeological structures cenotes temples sites permanently accessible public mexican government acknowledged controversy surrounding mrbeast mexico controversy centers fact youtuber allowed entry sites considered sacred mexico‚Äôs prehispanic cultures many cases restricted one part video mrbeast says ‚Äúi can‚Äôt believe government letting us it‚Äôs truly crazy even archaeologists allowed here‚Äù response controversy national institute anthropology history inah ‚Äì agency attached mexican government‚Äôs ministry culture ‚Äì declared monday visit recording carried ‚Äúformal requests‚Äù requests however made mrbeast rather ‚Äúthe federal ministry tourism governments of‚Äù yucat√°n campeche inah indicated description video mrbeast claims publication ‚Äúcollaboration mexican ministry tourism‚Äù mexican president claudia sheinbaum said wednesday permits ‚Äúbroadcast‚Äù asked inah report ‚Äúunder conditions permit granted‚Äù ‚Äúand permit violated must determined sanctions apply‚Äù president added points also caused controversy drone shot appears inside temple top el castillo chich√©n itz√° regarding inah said occur shot fact recorded outside structure also scenes mrbeast appears descend archaeological sites helicopter holds prehispanic mask hands inah says either false edited recording ‚Äúclearly video involves extensive audiovisual postproduction work alludes events occur fact producers never descended helicopter spent night inside archaeological site possessed prehispanic mask one presented clearly contemporary reproduction false assertions reflect theatricality youtuber question‚Äù easy apply permits true even archaeologists can enter mrbeast claims exploring filming broadcasting mexican archaeological sites restricted activity allowed inah stated institute personnel supervising mrbeast‚Äôs activities times access granted area permanently accessible general public ‚Äúthe tours conducted publicly accessible areas without affecting visitor access case calakmul substructure structure ii also visited although permanently open public provide access arranging scheduled visit advance justification case tours conducted communities surrounding archaeological site‚Äù said monday statement sheinbaum asked inah provide information nature permit mrbeast video announced scope points covers unknown however law exploration mexico‚Äôs archaeological sites permitted small group institutions september inah responded request citizen information requesting ‚Äúrequirements steps‚Äù necessary enter kukulkan pyramid chich√©n itz√° request director chich√©n itz√° archaeological zone jos√© francisco javier osorio le√≥n mentions ‚Äúin accordance‚Äù provisions federal law archaeological artistic historical monuments zones ‚Äúall types material work discover explore archaeological monuments carried national institute anthropology history scientific institutions recognized moral standing prior authorization‚Äù likewise article law states authorizations granted inah must specify ‚Äúthe terms conditions work must subject well obligations carry out‚Äù details permits mrbeast‚Äôs video still unknown inah stated although youtuber‚Äôs video offers ‚Äúdistorted‚Äù information dissemination ‚Äúmay motivate interest among young audiences mexico around world learn ancestral cultures visit archaeological sites‚Äù meanwhile federal culture secretary claudia curiel de icaza spoke activities carried mrbeast team archaeological sites ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt first time type incident happened it‚Äôs clarified course don‚Äôt agree course appropriate sanctions that‚Äôs spaces for‚Äù curiel de icaza said tuesday decorative utilitarian art event
Toddler held in US after parents deportation has been returned to Venezuela,"A Venezuelan toddler who had been kept in US government custody after her parents were deported has been returned to Venezuela.

Maikelys Antonella Espinoza Bernal arrived at the SimÛn BolÌvar International Airport on Wednesday on a repatriation flight from the US.

Venezuelan First Lady Cilia Flores carried the 2-year-old in her arms as officials announced the girlís return to reporters gathered at the airport.

ìToday we have a great victory,î Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said.

Venezuela had been demanding that the United States return the girl for weeks, accusing US officials of kidnapping her.

The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) previously denied the allegations and reiterated after their reunion that it was trying to protect Maikelys from her parents, whom they accused without evidence of being part of criminal group Tren de Aragua (TDA), which the US deems a foreign terrorist organization.ìThe childís mother, Yorely Escarleth Bernal Inciarte, oversees recruitment of young women for drug smuggling and prostitution for Tren de Aragua. For the childís safety, she was not removed with the mother,î DHS Public Affairs Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement Wednesday.

Maikelysí mother has rejected that claim.

McLaughlin also alleged that the father was an involved in the sale of illicit drugs and sex trafficking, among other crimes, and is ìlocked up in CECOT,î referring to El Salvadorís maximum security mega-prison.

Maikelysí father believes he was accused of being a gang member because of his tattoos, but denies they have anything to do with gangs, according to his sworn declaration filed in court in early March.

DHS said the child was ìrepatriated to Venezuela pursuant to a court order,î after spending 302 days in the custody of Office of Refugee Resettlement.

In March, the US deported the father Maiker Espinoza-Escalona to a notorious prison in El Salvador, according to the Venezuelan government. The mother Yorelys Bernal was later deported on a flight to Venezuela without her daughter.On Wednesday, the girl was reunited with her mother and grandmother at the presidential palace in Caracas. State TV showed Bernal crying tears of joy as she held her daughter tightly in her arms.

President Nicol·s Maduro said Venezuelan officials had coordinated with lawyers and rights groups in the US to secure the girlís return.

ìI have to thank in fairness Ambassador Richard Grenell, special envoy of (US) President Donald Trump, for his efforts. And with Ambassador Richard Grenell, thank President Donald Trump, as well,î he said.

ìThere have been and there will be differences, but itís possible with Godís blessing to move forward.î

CNN has reached out to the US State Departmentís Venezuela Affairs Unit for more information.

A family separated
The toddler and her parents entered the US in May 2024 to seek asylum, according to a court document filed by legal advocacy groups.

After their arrival, the couple were put in immigration detention while their daughter was placed in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), the father had said in a sworn declaration.

In July, he received a deportation order under the Biden administration. Between October and March, the couple had weekly, in-person visits with their daughter, Espinoza stated.was sent to El Salvador. She was forced to return to her country on a flight without her 2-year-old child, Venezuela said.

The girl was kept in ORR custody, with DHS saying, ìWe will not allow this child to be abused and continue to be exposed to criminal activity that endangers her safety.î

In an email to CNN, ORR declined to provide details on the girlís time in its custody, citing ìprivacy and securityî concerns.

"Severe wildfires in Russiaôs Siberia region rage through 600,000 hectares of forest","Severe wildfires raging in a Siberian region of Russia have engulfed more than 600,000 hectares of forest, local authorities have warned.

In the Eastern Siberian territory of Zabaykalsky Krai, a federal-level state of emergencies has been in place since late April, Russian state news agency TASS reported.

Despite huge efforts to tackle wildfire outbreaks in the region, which borders Mongolia, 49 forest fires continue to burn, with a total area exceeding 629,000 hectares, the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations said Wednesday.On Tuesday, the Russian republic of Buryatia declared a regional-level state of emergency on Tuesday and closed all access to the forests, state news agency RIA Novosti reported.

Since mid-March, 174 forest fires have blazed in Buryatia, which also borders Mongolia, the regionís forestry agency said according to RIA Novosti. Of those fires, 90% were caused by careless human activity, the agency said.

More than 530 firefighting personnel have been deployed to tackle the blazes, with 22 active fires in the Buryatia region as of Tuesday.

Russiaís wildfire season started earlier than usual this year, with fires recorded as early as mid-March, compared to May in previous years.

Dryer, hotter weather in Russia, exacerbated by climate change, create tinder box conditions that can cause a small fire to spread rapidly.

"Israel targets Hamas leader Mohammed Sinwar in hospital strike in Gaza, sources say","Israel has targeted Hamas leader Mohammed Sinwar in a strike on a hospital in southern Gaza on Tuesday evening, according to a senior Israeli official and two sources familiar with the matter.

He became the militant groupís de facto leader after the Israeli military killed his brother, Yahya Sinwar, last October.

Tuesdayís strike killed 28 Palestinians and injured more than 50, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, which does not differentiate between military and civilian casualties.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it carried out a strike on the European hospital in Khan Younis, targeting ìHamas terrorists in a command and control centerî in underground infrastructure beneath the hospital. The IDF did not identify the target of the strike.

Multiple airstrikes hit the yard of the hospital, according to Dr. Saleh Al Hams, the head of nursing. Some people are buried under the rubble, he said, calling it ìa catastrophe.î Medical teams tried to move patients to safe units inside the hospital.A woman whose mother was being treated for lung cancer at the European hospital told the UK-based aid organization Medical Aid for Palestinians at the time of the strikes.

ìExplosions came from every direction, smoke, fire, rubble, sand everywhere. My mother collapsed on the floor. Shrapnel was flying all around usÖThe terror was beyond words. We hardly escaped death,î she said.

Marwan al-Hams, Director General of Field Hospitals at the Ministry of Health in Gaza, said the strikes had targeted the hospitalís inner courtyard and damaged sewage and water networks.

Marwan added that ambulances were unable to reach the emergency department, and a bulldozer brought in to clear rubble had been hit in another strike on Wednesday.

ìUntil this damage is repaired, we will be forced to close most of the hospitalís departments,î he said.

Muneer Alboursh, director general of the health ministry said that the world had turned a blind eye to the suffering of Palestinian civilians, saying that Gaza had become a ìzone where human life is treated as expendable.î

ìIf this footage came from Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Charite, or St. Thomas in London, the world would be on fire. Global leaders would descend. Investigations would launch within hours. But it was the European Hospital in Gaza ñ even its name couldnít protect it,î Alboursh said.

Gaza Civil Defense said that three people were killed while on their way to the hospital Wednesday.

Hamas rejected any Israeli claims about Sinwar, saying in a statement, ìThe Palestinian resistance alone, through its official platforms, is the authority authorized to confirm or deny what is published.î

On Tuesday night, the IDF said it intercepted two rockets fired from Gaza, in what appears to be the first launch from the besieged territory in a month. A third rocket landed in an open area. The military wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the attack, saying they fired at Israeli cities near Gaza.

A short time later, Israel issued evacuation warnings for the Jabalya refugee camp and nearby areas in northern Gaza, saying the IDF will ìstrike and operate in every location from which rockets are fired.î

ëThey took the hostage and thatís ití
The targeting of Sinwar comes one day after Hamas released Israeli American Edan Alexander in what was a goodwill gesture to the United States. The deal for a single hostageís release sidelined Israel, as Hamas communicated with the Trump administration.

Strikes in Gaza overnight killed at least 56 people, according to the director general of the Ministry of Health, with a nurse at a hospital in northern Gaza saying most were women and children.

Many of the dead from the overnight strikes were taken to the Indonesian Hospital. One man there, Mohammad al Arbid, said his cousinís family had been killed and asked why there had been no relief after the release on Monday of the Israeli-American hostage.

ìThey took the hostage and thatís it, no aid entered, there are no blood units in the hospital, there is no medication, there is a 5-year old boy crying inside. He only needs painkiller and there isnít (any) in the whole hospital, while the world is watching.îThe US expressed some optimism about negotiations set to take place in Qatar with President Donald Trump and his envoy Steve Witkoff in the Middle East. Before leaving Israel, Witkoff promised the families of the hostages that he ìwill be relentless on that pursuit.î

But with negotiations about to start in Doha ñ and with an Israeli team en route ñ the targeting of Sinwar means Israel has just attempted to kill Hamasí key decision maker needed to seal any potential agreement.February 2024, the IDF said they had located his office in western Khan Younis.

Former US Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro said Sinwar was likely an obstacle in negotiations. ìThere is little chance the war can end before he dies,î Shapiro, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, told CNN. ìHis removal could open the door for the release of all hostages and beginning to move toward a post-war future for Gaza without Hamas.îBut even if Sinwar is dead, it could take some time before Israel says officially that it has killed him, and even longer for Hamas to acknowledge his death. In mid-July, Israel said it had targeted Mohammed Deif in a strike on a designated humanitarian zone in southern Gaza. It took until August, more than two weeks later, for the IDF to declare it had indeed killed Deif. Hamas did not confirm his death until the end of January, nearly six months later.

Second Sinwar targeted
Before October, it was primarily Yahya Sinwar who was in the crosshairs of the Israeli military. Imprisoned for four life sentences in 1988, Yahya became fluent in Hebrew and said he spent his years studying his enemy. He was released in 2011 as part of the deal to free Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who had been held hostage by Hamas in Gaza for five years. His release has been attributed to the fact that his brother Mohammed was one of Shalitís kidnappers and insisted on Yahyaís inclusion in the deal.

Back in Gaza, Yahya quickly rose through the ranks of the militant organization, ultimately becoming its leader

After October 7, Yahya became Israelís most wanted man, and the IDF searched for him in the tiny coastal enclave. US officials believed Israel had come close to Yahya more than once, flushing him out of underground hiding places.

But Yahya moved undetected in the tunnels under Gaza, rarely coming above ground and avoiding detection by Israelís electronic surveillance. Ultimately, it was a routine Israeli patrol in Gaza which engaged in a firefight in Rafah in southern Gaza that discovered Yahyaís body in Rafah.

Daughter of crypto boss escapes Paris kidnap attempt in latest in series of attacks,"Passers-by helped to foil the attempted kidnapping by armed assailants of the daughter and grandson of a French cryptocurrency boss in Paris, in a brazen daytime attack that was caught on camera.

The incident prompted Paymium, the Crypto firm owned by the father of the woman targeted, to demand ìprotectionsî for companies in Franceís cryptocurrency sphere.

Tuesday morningís attack in Parisís 11th district is the latest in a string of violent incidents targeting figures in Franceís burgeoning crypto industry, including two attacks in recent months and at least five since 2023.

Four masked men attacked the daughter, her partner and their child in the French capital, police sources told French news agency Agence France-Presse (AFP).

Video footage shows three masked men jump out of a white van with branding from the Chronopost delivery company. The woman and her partner fight the attackers and loud screams for help are heard. Speaking to BFMTV, one witness said the assailants tried to ìpull a young woman by forceî into the waiting vehicle.

The woman can be seen grabbing a gun off one of the masked men and throwing it into the street. The weapon, which was later recovered from the scene, turned out to be a fake, sources told BFMTV.The screams attract the attention of passersby, who intervene, one of them armed with a fire extinguisher.

ìI saw passersby saying to stop. A man went out into the street with a fire extinguisher to try to make these people leave,î a witness told French broadcaster BFMTV.Eventually the assailants give up, the three men jump back into their van and the fourth suspect ñ the driver ñ makes a getaway.

Another woman who witnessed the scene told BFMTV, ìI went out into the street and saw this man lying on the ground with a pistol next to him, quite bloody.î

Once the attack was over, the victims were helped by people on the street. All three of them sustained light injuries and were treated in hospital, BFMTV reported. The woman, who according to the news outlet was five months pregnant, was treated for shock, while her partnerís face was covered in blood.

The woman in the footage is the daughter of the CEO and co-founder of Paymium, a French cryptocurrency exchange platform, according to AFP.

Franceís Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau announced Wednesday he would hold a meeting with cryptocurrency entrepreneurs to discuss security in light of the spate of attacks, according to AFP.

In the wake of the attack, Paymium released a statement calling for authorities to ìimmediately adopt measures to reinforce the protection of collaborators of companies in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.î The firm thanked Retailleau for agreeing to meet with Paymium, to ìfurther discuss all these matters.î

The company also said it was ìextremely saddenedî by Tuesdayís attack and extended its support to the families of the victims.

No arrests have yet been made in relation to the incident, CNN understands. The Paris prosecutorís office told CNN that it has opened an investigation into offenses of attempted arrest, abduction, kidnapping or arbitrary detention committed by an organized gang, aggravated violence and participation in a criminal association.

Chronopost said that it did not believe the van involved in the attempted kidnapping was from its company, but rather an attempt to mimic its branding. ìNoting the absence of vehicle theft within our company fleet and given the non-compliant markings visible on the images of the vehicle used, everything suggests at this stage that we are dealing with an impersonation of our brand,î the company wrote on X.

The attack on Tuesday follows the abductions of other cryptocurrency figures in France.

On May 1, the father of a cryptocurrency entrepreneur was kidnapped in Parisís 14th district and held for ransom. Police officers freed the victim, who was missing a finger, two days later on May 3. Five suspects were arrested in or near the house where the victim was being held, as well as two others the following day. Two of them were later cleared.

In January, David Balland, a co-founder of French crypto firm Ledger, had his hand mutilated after he and his wife were kidnapped from their home in central France. They were freed after a police operation. Part of the ransom of 10 million euros ($11.2 million) in cryptocurrency demanded by the kidnappers was paid, but ìalmost all of the cryptocurrency was traced, frozen, and seized,î BMFTV reported, citing the public prosecutor.",14-May-25,World,Sophie Tanno,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/14/europe/paris-kidnap-crypto-attack-intl,,,,,,,,,,,,passersby helped foil attempted kidnapping armed assailants daughter grandson french cryptocurrency boss paris brazen daytime attack caught camera incident prompted paymium crypto firm owned father woman targeted demand ‚Äúprotections‚Äù companies france‚Äôs cryptocurrency sphere tuesday morning‚Äôs attack paris‚Äôs th district latest string violent incidents targeting figures france‚Äôs burgeoning crypto industry including two attacks recent months least five since four masked men attacked daughter partner child french capital police sources told french news agency agence francepresse afp video footage shows three masked men jump white van branding chronopost delivery company woman partner fight attackers loud screams help heard speaking bfmtv one witness said assailants tried ‚Äúpull young woman force‚Äù waiting vehicle woman can seen grabbing gun one masked men throwing street weapon later recovered scene turned fake sources told bfmtvthe screams attract attention passersby intervene one armed fire extinguisher ‚Äúi saw passersby saying stop man went street fire extinguisher try make people leave‚Äù witness told french broadcaster bfmtveventually assailants give three men jump back van fourth suspect ‚Äì driver ‚Äì makes getaway another woman witnessed scene told bfmtv ‚Äúi went street saw man lying ground pistol next quite bloody‚Äù attack victims helped people street three sustained light injuries treated hospital bfmtv reported woman according news outlet five months pregnant treated shock partner‚Äôs face covered blood woman footage daughter ceo cofounder paymium french cryptocurrency exchange platform according afp france‚Äôs interior minister bruno retailleau announced wednesday hold meeting cryptocurrency entrepreneurs discuss security light spate attacks according afp wake attack paymium released statement calling authorities ‚Äúimmediately adopt measures reinforce protection collaborators companies cryptocurrency ecosystem‚Äù firm thanked retailleau agreeing meet paymium ‚Äúfurther discuss matters‚Äù company also said ‚Äúextremely saddened‚Äù tuesday‚Äôs attack extended support families victims arrests yet made relation incident cnn understands paris prosecutor‚Äôs office told cnn opened investigation offenses attempted arrest abduction kidnapping arbitrary detention committed organized gang aggravated violence participation criminal association chronopost said believe van involved attempted kidnapping company rather attempt mimic branding ‚Äúnoting absence vehicle theft within company fleet given noncompliant markings visible images vehicle used everything suggests stage dealing impersonation brand‚Äù company wrote x attack tuesday follows abductions cryptocurrency figures france may father cryptocurrency entrepreneur kidnapped paris‚Äôs th district held ransom police officers freed victim missing finger two days later may five suspects arrested near house victim held well two others following day two later cleared january david balland cofounder french crypto firm ledger hand mutilated wife kidnapped home central france freed police operation part ransom million euros million cryptocurrency demanded kidnappers paid ‚Äúalmost cryptocurrency traced frozen seized‚Äù bmftv reported citing public prosecutor
Zelensky insists he will only join Ukraine-Russia talks in Turkey this week if Putin is present,"Ukraineís President Volodymyr Zelensky raised the stakes ahead of a potential meeting with Vladimir Putin in Turkey by saying he wouldnít hold talks with any Russian representative other than the president himself.

Zelensky said he would travel to Turkey after US President Donald Trump urged him to meet Putin. The Russian leader had suggested direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv in the country on Thursday in response to the ceasefire-or-sanctions ultimatum given to Moscow by Kyivís European allies on Saturday.

Asked by CNN about the goals of the possible meeting ñ one Putin has not yet agreed to attend despite proposing it himself ñ Zelensky said anything other than a ceasefire agreement would be a failure.Zelensky said he would not consider meeting any other Russian representatives because ìeverything in Russia dependsî on Putin.

ìSo I said that on (Thursday) I will go to Turkey and Iím ready to meet Putin and an end to the war was through direct talks with him,î Zelensky told reporters at a news conference.

Russia hopes to deal directly with Ukraine in Istanbul, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Russian state news agency TASS on Tuesday.

ìOur representatives are getting ready for this meeting,î the news agency quoted him as saying.

Although it is not clear whether the US or Russian presidents will show up in Istanbul, Trump has confirmed that Secretary of State Marco Rubio will attend the talks.

The uncertainty over Thursdayís talks comes amid growing international pressure on Moscow to agree to the US-backed plan for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron warned Tuesday that if Russia doesnít comply with those demands, sanctions ñ including on financial services ñ could be imposed ìin the coming days in close liaison with the United States.î

Going some way to make good on this threat, the European Union on Wednesday unveiled a fresh round of sanctions against Moscowís ìshadow fleetî of oil tankers, used by the Kremlin to circumvent previous Western sanctions against Russian oil exports.

Further sanctions could be imposed by France and Ukraineís other major European allies if Moscow does not agree to a ceasefire at the planned talks in Turkey.

Two European diplomatic sources told CNN they have low expectations for Thursday and doubt Putin will actually show up.

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a US-based conflict monitor, said on Monday that Russian officials already appeared to be setting conditions for Putin to reject the meeting, quoting several key aides as questioning Zelenskyís intentions and calling the proposed meeting ìpure spectacle.îZelensky also said he offered Trump the option of joining the meeting, saying the presence of the US president would ìgive additional impulse for Putin to fly in.î

He said earlier that his country ìwould appreciateî Trumpís attendance, and said he supported the US presidentís call for direct talks between himself and Putin.

Top Trump administration officials plan to be in Turkey this week, but the presidentís possible attendance remains an open question that will largely be dictated by whether his Russian counterpart attends, according to a senior administration official.

He is visiting the Gulf this week, making stops in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, for his first major overseas trip since the start of his second term. He said he could detour to Turkey ìif I thought it would be helpful.î

ìI think you may have a good result out of the Thursday meeting in Turkey between Russia and Ukraine,î Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday. ìI donít know where Iím going to be on Thursday, Iíve got so many meetings, but I was thinking about actually flying over there. Thereís a possibility of it, I guess, if I think things can happen.î

Whether Trump attends or not, US envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg and Trumpís foreign envoy Steve Witkoff both plan to be in Istanbul for the talks, the senior administration official said. Another source familiar with the plans also confirmed Witkoffís attendance. As of Tuesday, the plan was for the US officials to observe the Turkish-facilitated talks between the Ukrainians and Russians.

Front line largely static
For months, Ukraine and its allies tried to convince the Trump administration that Putin acts in bad faith, and have said Russiaís agreeing to a ceasefire could function as a test of whether it is serious about achieving the peace the US president has long demanded.

Ukraineís major European allies had given Russia an ultimatum on Saturday: agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine or face ìmassiveî new sanctions.

Putin ignored the ultimatum, proposing the talks instead. Direct talks between the leaders of Russia and Ukraine have not happened since the early weeks of Moscowís unprovoked full-scale invasion in 2022.

Speaking on Tuesday, Zelensky said he expects the US and Europe to impose new ìstrongî sanctions on Russia if Moscow doesnít sign up to the ceasefire on Thursday.

Meanwhile, the situation on the ground in eastern Ukraine doesnít seem to suggest Russia is preparing for a ceasefire. Russian troops have been inching forward in several key areas along the front line and launching near-daily drone and missile attacks against Ukrainian cities. Still, the front line in eastern Ukraine has not moved dramatically in recent months, with neither side able to break through.

The ISW said on Monday that Russia has reportedly deployed a largely ceremonial regiment of the Federal Security Service (FSB) to the front line, which the ISW said was ìlikely in an effort to generate fear of more rapid future Russian advances.î",14-May-25,World,"Jessie Yeung, Ivana Kottasov√É¬°, Nick Paton Walsh, Andrew Carey",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/12/europe/trump-russia-ukraine-talks-turkey-intl-hnk,,,,,,,,,,,,ukraine‚Äôs president volodymyr zelensky raised stakes ahead potential meeting vladimir putin turkey saying wouldn‚Äôt hold talks russian representative president zelensky said travel turkey us president donald trump urged meet putin russian leader suggested direct talks moscow kyiv country thursday response ceasefireorsanctions ultimatum given moscow kyiv‚Äôs european allies saturday asked cnn goals possible meeting ‚Äì one putin yet agreed attend despite proposing ‚Äì zelensky said anything ceasefire agreement failurezelensky said consider meeting russian representatives ‚Äúeverything russia depends‚Äù putin ‚Äúso said thursday go turkey i‚Äôm ready meet putin end war direct talks him‚Äù zelensky told reporters news conference russia hopes deal directly ukraine istanbul russian deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov told russian state news agency tass tuesday ‚Äúour representatives getting ready meeting‚Äù news agency quoted saying although clear whether us russian presidents show istanbul trump confirmed secretary state marco rubio attend talks uncertainty thursday‚Äôs talks comes amid growing international pressure moscow agree usbacked plan day ceasefire ukraine french president emmanuel macron warned tuesday russia doesn‚Äôt comply demands sanctions ‚Äì including financial services ‚Äì imposed ‚Äúin coming days close liaison united states‚Äù going way make good threat european union wednesday unveiled fresh round sanctions moscow‚Äôs ‚Äúshadow fleet‚Äù oil tankers used kremlin circumvent previous western sanctions russian oil exports sanctions imposed france ukraine‚Äôs major european allies moscow agree ceasefire planned talks turkey two european diplomatic sources told cnn low expectations thursday doubt putin actually show institute study war isw usbased conflict monitor said monday russian officials already appeared setting conditions putin reject meeting quoting several key aides questioning zelensky‚Äôs intentions calling proposed meeting ‚Äúpure spectacle‚Äùzelensky also said offered trump option joining meeting saying presence us president ‚Äúgive additional impulse putin fly in‚Äù said earlier country ‚Äúwould appreciate‚Äù trump‚Äôs attendance said supported us president‚Äôs call direct talks putin top trump administration officials plan turkey week president‚Äôs possible attendance remains open question largely dictated whether russian counterpart attends according senior administration official visiting gulf week making stops saudi arabia united arab emirates qatar first major overseas trip since start second term said detour turkey ‚Äúif thought helpful‚Äù ‚Äúi think may good result thursday meeting turkey russia ukraine‚Äù trump told reporters white house monday ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know i‚Äôm going thursday i‚Äôve got many meetings thinking actually flying there‚Äôs possibility guess think things can happen‚Äù whether trump attends us envoy ukraine keith kellogg trump‚Äôs foreign envoy steve witkoff plan istanbul talks senior administration official said another source familiar plans also confirmed witkoff‚Äôs attendance tuesday plan us officials observe turkishfacilitated talks ukrainians russians front line largely static months ukraine allies tried convince trump administration putin acts bad faith said russia‚Äôs agreeing ceasefire function test whether serious achieving peace us president long demanded ukraine‚Äôs major european allies given russia ultimatum saturday agree unconditional day ceasefire ukraine face ‚Äúmassive‚Äù new sanctions putin ignored ultimatum proposing talks instead direct talks leaders russia ukraine happened since early weeks moscow‚Äôs unprovoked fullscale invasion speaking tuesday zelensky said expects us europe impose new ‚Äústrong‚Äù sanctions russia moscow doesn‚Äôt sign ceasefire thursday meanwhile situation ground eastern ukraine doesn‚Äôt seem suggest russia preparing ceasefire russian troops inching forward several key areas along front line launching neardaily drone missile attacks ukrainian cities still front line eastern ukraine moved dramatically recent months neither side able break isw said monday russia reportedly deployed largely ceremonial regiment federal security service fsb front line isw said ‚Äúlikely effort generate fear rapid future russian advances‚Äù

"Inside the Bayesian final moments: extreme winds sank superyacht, interim report finds","Sudden, hurricane-force winds toppled the luxury Bayesian superyacht that sank off the coast of Sicily last August, according to an interim report into the disaster, which found the boat had ìvulnerabilitiesî to extreme wind which were not known to the owner or crew.

The 184-foot sailing boat owned by British tech tycoon Mike Lynch was anchored about a half mile from the port of Porticello on the Italian islandís northern coast when it sank, killing seven people, including Lynch and his 18-year-old daughter Hannah.

Initial efforts to recover the remains of the yacht have also proved deadly. A diver involved in the operations died in an accident on Friday, May 9. The diver has been confirmed as Rob Cornelis Maria Huijben Uiben, a 39-year-old Dutch national who worked for TMC, the company running the recovery.The exact cause of his death remains unclear, although the public prosecutorís office told CNN that there was evidence his body had been pierced with a metal shard.

Work to recover the superyacht was paused in the wake of his death, but restarted again on Thursday morning. However, an orange weather warning for rain, thunderstorms and strong winds was in place in the region when the operation resumed.On the evening of August 13 when Bayesianís guests and some of its crew retired for the night, the seas were calm and the winds were light, but thunderstorms were forecast, the report said.

Bayesianís skipper, James Cutfield, told the overnight watchkeepers to wake him if the wind speed increased above 23 mph or if the boat started dragging anchor, the report said.

At around 3 a.m., one of the watchkeepers noticed storm clouds and lightning seemed to be getting closer, though the wind was blowing at around 9 mph from the west.

An hour later, the wind picked up to 34 mph. Around 3:55 a.m., the watchkeeper filmed a video of the advancing storm and posted it to social media, according to the report, before closing the cockpit windows and forward hatches to protect the yachtís interior from rain.

Eyewitnesses described furious gales and hurricane-like winds that left an avalanche of debris near the pier.At 3:57 a.m., the yacht started dragging its anchor, and the watchkeeper woke the skipper and other crewmembers, the report said. Some of the guests were also woken by the storm. Lynch made his way to the boatís flybridge to see if the taxis arranged for 8 a.m. that morning would have to be canceled because of the storm. The yachtís chef began stowing cutlery, pots and pans.

Then, the wind suddenly increased to more than 80 mph, and at around 4:06 a.m. the yacht ìviolently heeled overî to a 90-degree angle in less than 15 seconds, sending people, furniture and other loose items flying across the deck, the report said.

ìThere was no indication of flooding inside Bayesian until water came in over the starboard rails and, within seconds, entered the internal spaces down the stairwells,î the report said.

Guests and crew scrambled to escape the sinking ship, with two guests using furniture drawers as a ladder to escape their cabin, according to the report.

The survivors treaded water and used cushions from the boat as flotation devices before the boatís chief officer was able to detach and inflate a life raft, the report said.

Responding to a flare from the life raft, the skipper of a nearby ship rescued the survivors before calling the local coast guard, the report said.Seven people died in the accident, including the yachtís chef Recaldo Thomas, Morgan Stanley International director Jonathan Bloomer, prominent American lawyer Chris Morvillo, and both of their wives ñ Judy Bloomer and Neda Morvillo. Cutfield and 14 other people survived the sinking, including Lynchís wife, Angela Bacares.

Winds of 73 mph were enough to knock the Bayesian beyond the point of no recovery, the investigation found. It also said it is possible Bayesian could have been vulnerable to lighter winds.

ìThese vulnerabilities (when in the motoring condition with sails lowered, the centreboard raised and 10% consumables on board) were not identified in the stability information book carried on board,î the report said. ìConsequently, these vulnerabilities were also unknown to either the owner or the crew of Bayesian.î

"Russia and Ukraine are due to meet. But with Putin a no-show, confusion reigns. Here's what we know","Days of speculation that Ukraineís President Volodymyr Zelensky could meet with Russiaís President Vladimir Putin in Turkey have ended with the Kremlin pouring cold water on the idea, confirming that the Russian leader had decided not to show up for talks he himself suggested.

The possibility of direct talks between Russia and Ukraine was not entirely off the table as of Thursday morning, however, with lower-level delegations from both countries known to be in Turkey.

A direct meeting would be a major development ñ the two sides are not known to have met directly since soon after Moscow launched its unprovoked, full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

And while the talks are unlikely to yield immediate results, and almost certainly wonít bring the elusive ìdealî US President Donald Trump has been promising since his return to the White House, they could still have a major impact on the future of the war ñ if Trump decides that Putinís no-show is a sign of his unwillingness to end the war.

Adding to the general uncertainty over how a day of high-stakes diplomacy might unfold, Zelensky is sitting down with Turkeyís President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the capital, Ankara, while US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is in southern Turkey for an informal meeting of NATO foreign ministers.How did we get to this point?
The talks were first proposed by Putin in response to the ceasefire-or-sanctions ultimatum given to Moscow by Ukraineís European allies on Saturday, when the leaders of Germany, France, Poland and the United Kingdom demanded that Russia accept a 30-day ceasefire proposal or face a new round of ìmassiveî sanctions.

Putin ignored the ultimatum, proposing instead ìdirect talksî between Russia and Ukraine.

This was likely a delaying tactic by Putin ñ something he has successfully deployed several times in the past. But it appears to have backfired.

The Europeans and Ukraine initially said there could be no talks before a ceasefire is agreed, but that quickly changed when Trump got involved. In a post on social media, he publicly urged Zelensky to ìHAVE THE MEETING, NOW!!!îTrump, currently on a Middle East tour, added to the pressure by suggesting he might go as well, ìif itís helpful.î That idea was endorsed by Zelensky, who said Ukraine would be ìgratefulî for Trumpís presence. Trump also told CNN on Wednesday that Putin would ìlike me to be there.î

But two White House officials told CNN that Trump was not planning to travel to Turkey. ìI was thinking about going,î Trump said Thursday in Qatar, but stressed it wasnít a firm plan. He kept the option open, though, adding: ìIf something happened, Iíd go on Friday if it was appropriate.î

By putting the ball in Putinís court, Zelensky placed the Russian leader under pressure.

If Putin had decided to show up, he would have undermined his own narrative that Zelensky and his government are illegitimate.

But by staying at home, Putin gave Zelensky an opportunity to point out, once again, that Russia is not serious about peace.

This message is aimed squarely at Trump. Kyiv and its European allies have long said they donít believe Putin is seriously interested in negotiating peace.

Trump has previously repeatedly expressed his belief in the opposite, although he began expressing his doubts in recent weeks, questioning whether Putin wants peace after speaking to Zelensky on the sidelines of Pope Francisí funeral in the Vatican last month.

Highlighting this is likely the key reason why Zelensky suggested a personal meeting with Putin, who, according to Ukrainian and Western intelligence services, had previously ordered his assassination.What could be on the table?
The two sides are so far apart that it is unclear what the talks ñ if they indeed happen ñ would be about.

Zelensky said on Tuesday that anything other than an agreement on an unconditional ceasefire would be a failure.

Putin, meanwhile, said that while Russia does not rule out that ìduring these talks there will be a possibility to arrange some kind of new truce, a new ceasefire,î the talks will aim to eliminate the ìroot causesî of the conflict.

The ìroot causesî he cites include long-held Russian grievances that include the existence of Ukraine ñ formerly part of the Soviet Union ñ as a sovereign state, and NATOís eastward expansion since the end of the Cold War.

Neither is negotiable for Ukraine or its allies.

What happened the last time Ukraine and Russia talked?
The last known direct talks between Kyiv and Moscow took place in Turkey and Belarus in the spring of 2022 ñ when it became clear that Putinís initial plan to take over the whole of Ukraine and install a new puppet government in Kyiv within a few days had gone catastrophically wrong.If not Putin, who is coming?
Shortly after Zelensky challenged the Russian leader to travel to Turkey, the Kremlin started to lay the groundwork for the possibility that Putin might not attend.

The Kremlin late Wednesday said Vladimir Medinsky, Putinís senior aide and member of the countryís Supreme Council bureau, would lead a delegation of Kremlin insiders. The aide previously headed Russiaís delegation in 2022 when Kyiv and Moscow had their last known direct talks.

This is in line with Putinís call for the talks to pick up where the meeting in 2022 stopped ñ an option that would be unpalatable to the Ukrainians since the demands Russia was making back then would amount to a capitulation by Kyiv.

The stakes are higher this time though, as both Trump and Ukraineís European allies have said they will impose more sanctions on Moscow if it doesnít agree to the ceasefire.

Itís not yet clear whether Ukraine will send a delegation to Istanbul to meet with the Russian negotiators and who might be part of it.

What else do we know about the talks?
Not much. The Turkish government said earlier this week that it was prepared to provide ìall kinds of support, including mediation and hosting negotiations, to achieve peaceî in Ukraine.

Turkey has played the role of the bridge between Moscow and Kyiv in the past, most notably when it brokered the Black Sea Grain Initiative which guarantees the safe passage of Ukrainian ships carrying food exports ñ a rare diplomatic success in the brutal conflict. Russia withdrew from the pact in 2023.

As a NATO member, Turkey is invested in the conflict, but it is also seen as more amenable to Russia, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan previously hailing his ìspecial relationshipî with Putin.

Trumpís special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, and his foreign envoy Steve Witkoff both plan to be in Istanbul this week, a senior Trump administration official said on Tuesday, a statement confirmed by another source familiar with the plans.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is also in Turkey, attending the informal meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Antalya.

Rubio, Kellogg and Witkoff all took part in some of the previous rounds of talks in Saudi Arabia, in which they acted as intermediaries, meeting separately with the Russian delegation and then, a few days later, with the Ukrainians.

This time, the possibility that the two delegations might meet face to face is significant ñ even if their goal is more about satisfying Trump than reaching an actual deal.

Peter Sullivan put his hand over his mouth and wept as the Court of Appeal in London quashed his conviction and ordered his freedom after he had spent years fighting to prove his innocence.

Sullivan, who watched the hearing by video from Wakefield prison in northern England, said through his lawyer that he was not resentful and was anxious to see his loved ones.

ìAs god is my witness, it is said the truth shall take you free,î attorney Sarah Myatt read from a statement outside court. ìIt is unfortunate that it does not give a timescale as we advance towards resolving the wrongs done to me. I am not angry, I am not bitter.î

He was the longest-serving victim of a wrongful conviction in the U.K., Myatt said.

Sullivan, 68, was convicted in 1987 of killing Diane Sindall in Bebington, near Liverpool in northwest England. He was behind bars for 38 years.Sindall, 21, a florist who was engaged to be married, was returning home from a part-time job at a pub on a Friday night in August 1986 when her van ran out of fuel, police said. She was last seen walking along the road after midnight.

Her body was found about 12 hours later in an alley. She had been sexually assaulted and badly beaten.

Sexual fluid found on Sindallís body could not be scientifically analyzed until recently. A test in 2024 revealed it wasnít Sullivan, defense attorney Jason Pitter said.

ìThe prosecution case is that it was one person. It was one person who carried out a sexual assault on the victim,î Pitter said. ìThe evidence here is now that one person was not the defendant.î

Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson did not challenge the appeal and said that if the DNA evidence had been available at the time of the investigation it was inconceivable that Sullivan would have been prosecuted.

Merseyside Police said it reopened the investigation as the appeal was underway and was ìcommitted to doing everythingî to find the killer.

The Criminal Cases Review Commission, which examines possible wrongful convictions, declined to refer Sullivanís case to the appeals court in 2008 because it said testing at the time was unlikely to produce a DNA profile.A commission spokesperson said that while it made the correct decision based on the evidence at the time, it regretted not identifying the potential miscarriage of justice in its first review.

Sullivan appealed in 2019 without the CCRCís help and the court turned down his bid in 2021.

But the commission took up the case later that year and was able to use scientific techniques that hadnít been available during the earlier review to find the DNA that set Sullivan free.ìIn the light of that evidence, it is impossible to regard the appellantís conviction as safe,î Justice Timothy Holroyde said.

Police said the DNA found in the subsequent investigation does not match anyone in a national database. Theyíve ruled out as suspects Sindallís fiancÈ, members of her family and more than 260 men who have been screened since they reopened the investigation.

Sullivanís sister, Kim Smith, reflected outside the court on the toll the case had taken on two families.

ìWe lost Peter for 39 years and at the end of the day itís not just us,î Smith said. ìPeter hasnít won and neither has the Sindall family. Theyíve lost their daughter, they are not going to get her back. Weíve got Peter back and now weíve got to try and build a life around him again.î",13-May-25,World,Story by the Associated Press,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/13/uk/uk-peter-sullivan-conviction-overturned-intl-hnk,,,,,,,,,,,,man spent nearly four decades british prison killing barmaid said angry bitter tuesday murder conviction overturned released exonerated dna evidence peter sullivan put hand mouth wept court appeal london quashed conviction ordered freedom spent years fighting prove innocence sullivan watched hearing video wakefield prison northern england said lawyer resentful anxious see loved ones ‚Äúas god witness said truth shall take free‚Äù attorney sarah myatt read statement outside court ‚Äúit unfortunate give timescale advance towards resolving wrongs done angry bitter‚Äù longestserving victim wrongful conviction uk myatt said sullivan convicted killing diane sindall bebington near liverpool northwest england behind bars yearssindall florist engaged married returning home parttime job pub friday night august van ran fuel police said last seen walking along road midnight body found hours later alley sexually assaulted badly beaten sexual fluid found sindall‚Äôs body scientifically analyzed recently test revealed wasn‚Äôt sullivan defense attorney jason pitter said ‚Äúthe prosecution case one person one person carried sexual assault victim‚Äù pitter said ‚Äúthe evidence now one person defendant‚Äù prosecutor duncan atkinson challenge appeal said dna evidence available time investigation inconceivable sullivan prosecuted merseyside police said reopened investigation appeal underway ‚Äúcommitted everything‚Äù find killer criminal cases review commission examines possible wrongful convictions declined refer sullivan‚Äôs case appeals court said testing time unlikely produce dna profilea commission spokesperson said made correct decision based evidence time regretted identifying potential miscarriage justice first review sullivan appealed without ccrc‚Äôs help court turned bid commission took case later year able use scientific techniques hadn‚Äôt available earlier review find dna set sullivan free‚Äúin light evidence impossible regard appellant‚Äôs conviction safe‚Äù justice timothy holroyde said police said dna found subsequent investigation match anyone national database they‚Äôve ruled suspects sindall‚Äôs fianc√© members family men screened since reopened investigation sullivan‚Äôs sister kim smith reflected outside court toll case taken two families ‚Äúwe lost peter years end day it‚Äôs just us‚Äù smith said ‚Äúpeter hasn‚Äôt won neither sindall family they‚Äôve lost daughter going get back we‚Äôve got peter back now we‚Äôve got try build life around again‚Äù
French actor rard Depardieu found guilty of sexual assault,"A court in Paris on Tuesday found French actor GÈrard Depardieu guilty of sexually assaulting two women on a film set in 2021 and handed him an 18-month suspended prison sentence, in a fall from grace for a towering figure of French cinema.

In one of the highest-profile #MeToo cases to come before judges in France, Depardieu repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and his lawyer said he would appeal the courtís decision.

Depardieu, 76, was a towering figure in French cinema, starring in more than 200 films over five decades, including ìGreen Card,î ìThe Last Metroî and ìCyrano de Bergerac.î

His trial marked a moment of reckoning for the #MeToo protest movement over sexual violence, which has failed to gain the same traction in France as in the United States, although there are signs that social attitudes are changing.

One of the two plaintiffs, Amelie K, a set decorator now aged 54, told the court the actor had groped her all over her body as he trapped her between his legs and made explicit sexual comments on set in 2021.

ìI was terrified, he was laughing,î she recounted.

Depardieu, who denied sexual assault, had argued before the court that he did not consider placing a hand on a personís buttocks sexual assault and that some women were too easily shocked.

Handing down his sentence, the presiding judge, Thierry Donard, said of Depardieu: ìHe does not seem to have grasped either the concept of consent or the deleterious and traumatic consequences of his behaviour towards the women he assaulted.î

He ordered Depardieu, who was not in court for the verdict, to be put on a list of sex offenders.

#MeToo reckoning
Depardieu has figured prominently in the debate over the #MeToo movement in France, as he faced a growing number of sexual assault allegations that put a spotlight on how women are treated in the movie industry.

Prosecutors say he should face trial in a separate rape investigation, following allegations brought by actress Charlotte Arnould, 29, who said she could not bear remaining silent any longer.

More than a dozen women have accused Depardieu of sexual violence, though not all have filed complaints.

Depardieu has consistently denied wrongdoing. ìNever, absolutely never, have I abused a woman,î he wrote in an open letter in the daily Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023.

The Depardieu trial laid bare a generational divide in France over sexism.

Earlier during the investigation, a group of 50 French stars, including Carla Bruni, wife of former President Nicolas Sarkozy, denounced what they called the ìlynchingî of Depardieu.

Brigitte Bardot, 90, told BFM TV this week that ìthose who have talent and grope a girl get thrown into the gutter.î

Womenís rights campaigners say they have seen a shift in attitudes in France - notably following the case of Gisele Pelicot whose ex-husband was convicted last year of inviting dozens of men to rape her after drugging her unconscious.

ìItís truly a victory and a step forward. Weíre making progress,î Amelie K. told reporters after the verdict."," May 13, 2025",World,Julien De Rosa,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/13/europe/gerard-depardieu-sexual-assault-trial-intl,,,,,,,,,,,,court paris tuesday found french actor g√©rard depardieu guilty sexually assaulting two women film set handed month suspended prison sentence fall grace towering figure french cinema one highestprofile metoo cases come judges france depardieu repeatedly denied wrongdoing lawyer said appeal court‚Äôs decision depardieu towering figure french cinema starring films five decades including ‚Äúgreen card‚Äù ‚Äúthe last metro‚Äù ‚Äúcyrano de bergerac‚Äù trial marked moment reckoning metoo protest movement sexual violence failed gain traction france united states although signs social attitudes changing one two plaintiffs amelie k set decorator now aged told court actor groped body trapped legs made explicit sexual comments set ‚Äúi terrified laughing‚Äù recounted depardieu denied sexual assault argued court consider placing hand person‚Äôs buttocks sexual assault women easily shocked handing sentence presiding judge thierry donard said depardieu ‚Äúhe seem grasped either concept consent deleterious traumatic consequences behaviour towards women assaulted‚Äù ordered depardieu court verdict put list sex offenders metoo reckoning depardieu figured prominently debate metoo movement france faced growing number sexual assault allegations put spotlight women treated movie industry prosecutors say face trial separate rape investigation following allegations brought actress charlotte arnould said bear remaining silent longer dozen women accused depardieu sexual violence though filed complaints depardieu consistently denied wrongdoing ‚Äúnever absolutely never abused woman‚Äù wrote open letter daily le figaro newspaper october depardieu trial laid bare generational divide france sexism earlier investigation group french stars including carla bruni wife former president nicolas sarkozy denounced called ‚Äúlynching‚Äù depardieu brigitte bardot told bfm tv week ‚Äúthose talent grope girl get thrown gutter‚Äù women‚Äôs rights campaigners say seen shift attitudes france notably following case gisele pelicot whose exhusband convicted last year inviting dozens men rape drugging unconscious ‚Äúit‚Äôs truly victory step forward we‚Äôre making progress‚Äù amelie k told reporters verdict
UK police arrest man for arson after fire at PM Starmer house,"British police said on Tuesday they had arrested a 21-year-old man on suspicion of arson after counter-terrorism officers launched an investigation into three fires, including one at Prime Minister Keir Starmerís private home.

Police were called to reports of a fire in the early hours of Monday morning at the property in Kentish Town in north London, the area that Starmer represents in parliament.

Nobody was injured but damage was caused to the propertyís entrance, police said.The man was arrested in the early hours of Tuesday on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life in connection with the fire and two further incidents, police said. He remains in custody, they added.

Police are investigating whether a fire at the entrance of a property in nearby Islington on Sunday and a vehicle fire in Kentish Town on Thursday are linked to the incident on Monday.

A BBC report said the Islington property was also connected to the prime minister.Starmer lived in the terraced house on a back street with his wife and two children before he moved into Number 10 Downing Street when he became prime minister last July.

Officers from Londonís Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command were leading the investigation due to the propertyís connections with a high-profile public figure, police said.

Zelensky challenges Putin offer to meet after Russia ignores ceasefire demand,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he is prepared to meet Vladimir Putin this week, shortly after US President Donald Trump urged him to ìimmediatelyî accept the Russian leaderís offer to hold peace talks in Turkey.

After meeting in Kyiv on Saturday, Ukraineís major European allies gave Russia an ultimatum: agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine by Monday or face ìmassiveî new sanctions. Trump supported the initiative, Germanyís new chancellor Friedrich Merz said.

In a late-night address, Putin did not acknowledge the ultimatum. Ignoring the ceasefire offer, he instead proposed holding ìdirect talksî with Ukraine in Turkey on Thursday ñ something not seen since the early weeks of Moscowís full-scale invasion in 2022.

Ukraineís allies spent Sunday stressing that there could be no further talks before Putin agrees to an unconditional ceasefire. But Trump undermined the efforts to put pressure on Putin, saying that Ukraine should ìimmediatelyî agree to meet with Russian officials on Thursday.

ìHAVE THE MEETING, NOW!!!î Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Within an hour, Zelensky said he was prepared to meet with Putin this week, in what would be the leadersí first meeting since Russia launched its war.

ìI will be waiting for Putin in T¸rkiye on Thursday. Personally. I hope that this time the Russians will not look for excuses,î Zelensky said Sunday on X.

Although Zelensky said a ìfull and lasting ceasefireî from Monday would provide ìthe necessary basis for diplomacy,î he did not specify that this would be a precondition for attending the talks.

Whereas Putin on Saturday faced a joint call from Europe and the US to accept a ceasefire by Mondayís deadline, his counteroffer of ìdirectî talks had by Sunday relieved much of the pressure on Moscow and shifted the focus to the potential talks this week. European leaders have not yet said whether they will press ahead with the threatened additional sanctions on Russia if a ceasefire is not in place by Monday.
Before Trumpís comment, Zelensky had responded with trepidation to Putinís offer, calling it a ìpositive sign,î but stressing that Kyiv first expects Moscow to agree to the new ceasefire proposal. Ukraineís European allies more forcefully dismissed Putinís offer, saying there could be no new talks before a ceasefire.

Merz, Germanyís new chancellor, said talks ìcannot begin until weapons fall silent.î Polandís Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the world was still waiting on Russiaís ìunivocal decision on an immediate and unconditional ceasefire.î French President Emmanuel Macron said Putinís counter-offer was ìnot enough.î

Keith Kellogg, the Trump administrationís special envoy to Ukraine, whose influence has dwindled since January, echoed the Europeansí claims, saying a ceasefire must come before talks, ìnot the other way round.î

But Trump abandoned his earlier demand that Russia agree to a 30-day ceasefire, instead calling on Ukraine to attend the peace talks without preconditions.

For months, Ukraine and its allies tried to convince the Trump administration that Putin acts in bad faith, and have said Russiaís agreeing to a ceasefire could function as a test of whether it is serious about achieving the peace the US president has long demanded.

But Putinís offer for direct talks ñ made in a rare televised address at 1 a.m. local time Sunday ñ was a gamble to distract from the fact that Russia is likely to snub Mondayís ceasefire deadline, analysts said.

Putinís offer put Zelensky under ìhuge pressureî to agree to hold talks in Turkey, Sergey Radchenko, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, told CNN.

ìWhy? Because otherwise, heíll have to deal with Trump, whoís going to say, ëWhy are you undermining my peace initiative here? Why canít you just talk?íî

Turkey ëreadyí to host talks
Already setting the stage for talks, Putin spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday. The Kremlin said Erdogan ìfully supportedî Putinís proposal for peace talks and had offered Istanbul as a venue.

On Monday, Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov held a phone call with his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan to discuss the start of direct negotiations, according to statements from both sides.

Although Ankara confirmed Turkey is ready to host the negotiations, a statement from the countryís presidency suggested that it agreed with Ukraineís allies that a ceasefire must come before talks.ìNoting that a window of opportunity to achieve peace has opened, President Erdo?an said that a comprehensive ceasefire would create the necessary environment for peace talks,î the statement read. It did not say whether Turkey would decline to host the talks if Russia refused the ceasefire offer.

The White House said Secretary of State Marco Rubio will visit Turkey from Wednesday to Friday, to attend an informal meeting of NATO foreign ministers and discuss ìending the Russia-Ukraine war,î meaning he will be in the country on the day of Putinís proposed peace talks.

Trumpís dropping of his demand for Russia to agree to a ceasefire marks a dramatic change in approach. Last week, Trump had called for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine, without providing a deadline. ìIf the ceasefire is not respected, the US and its partners will impose further sanctions,î he warned. The European leaders in Kyiv added weight to the threat by naming Monday as a deadline.

Radchenko said that Putinís late-night offer of peace talks was an attempt to shift the pressure on Russia back onto Ukraine.

ìHe knows that Trump wants direct talks,î Radchenko said. ìNow, by saying, ëLook, weíre offering talks and the Ukrainians are the ones who are not agreeing,í he is putting the ball back in Kyivís court.î

As well as distracting from his snubbing the ceasefire proposal, the offer allowed Putin to pose ìas the peacemaker, kindly inviting Ukraine to the table,î Radchenko said. ìHeís seen as taking the initiative.î

In his address, Putin said Russia does not rule out that ìduring these talks there will be a possibility to arrange some kind of new truce, a new ceasefire,î but stressed that the talks will aim to eliminate the ìroot causesî of the conflict.

Around the same time as Putinís late-night speech, a three-day pause in fighting ordered by Russiaís leader came to an end, with Ukraine reporting more than 100 drone attacks overnight. Both sides accused each other of continuing attacks during the truce, ordered by Putin to mark Russiaís World War II Victory Day.

Trump embrace of Syria and its jihadist-turned-president could shake up the Middle East,"US President Donald Trump on Wednesday had tea with a former jihadist who until recently had a $10 million US bounty on his head.

Interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, once known by his militant nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, met Trump in Riyadh six months after leading a swift campaign that toppled the half-a-century-old Assad regime, ejecting Iran-backed armed groups and declaring himself leader of the country.

Al Sharaa was placed on the US Specially Designated Global Terrorist list in 2013 for heading al Qaedaís affiliate in Syria, known as Al Nusra Front, and allegedly orchestrating suicide bombings across Syria. The Saudi-born former jihadist had spent years fighting US forces in Iraq before moving to Syria to lead an armed Islamist rebellion that ousted the brutal dictator Bashar al-Assad.


The meeting, described by Syria as ìhistoric,î was the first between a US and Syrian president in 25 years, taking place during Trump Middle East tour, the first set of state visits of his second term.

Both leaders were seen smiling in photos released by the White House and the Saudi foreign ministry. The Syrian foreign ministry said Trump committed to ìstanding by Syria at this critical juncture.î

A day earlier, Trump announced the removal of decades-old sanctions on Syria, a move that prompted a 40-second-long applause from the audience, including a standing ovation from the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
ìOh, what I do for the Crown Prince,î Trump told the room on Tuesday, crediting the de facto Saudi leader for leading the effort to lift what the president called ìbrutal and cripplingî sanctions. Syria has been designated by the US as a State Sponsor of Terrorism since December 1979.

Syriaís economy has been crippled for years by Western sanctions. Among the harshest is the USí 2019 Caesar Act, which imposed wide-ranging sanctions that restricted individuals, companies or governments from economic activities assisting Assadís war effort. The act rendered the entire economy untouchable. According to the World Bank, the countryís economy shrank by more than half between 2010 and 2020.

As of 2022, poverty was affecting 69% of Syriaís population, according to the World Bank. Extreme poverty affected more than one in four Syrians in 2022, the bank said, adding that this number likely deteriorated after a devastating earthquake in February 2023.

Gulf states have been keen to invest in Syria and prop up its economy but have been wary of violating US sanctions. Trumpís move is likely to remove such barriers, making way for potentially billions of dollars in investments.During the meeting, Trump proposed that Sharaa take a series of measures, including normalization with Israel, expelling foreign and Palestinian ìterrorists,î and helping the US to prevent the resurgence of ISIS, according to the White House.

Bringing Syria in from the cold gives a lifeline to the countryís fledgling regime and its president, who pledged in an interview with CNN last year that Syriaís armed opposition ultimately plans to form a government defined by institutions and a ìcouncil chosen by the people.î But it also presents an opportunity for Gulf Arab states and Turkey, which also pushed for sanctions to be lifted, to expand their influence in Syria and profit from it after decades of being left out of the country.

ìThe fact that he (Trump) did it so publicly and from Riyadh I think is a sort of tacit approval for those who are looking to invest in Syria potentially as well,î Natasha Hall of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) said. ì(It) means that he is giving wins to Mohammed bin Salman.î

Cautious optimism among Syrians
Fireworks lit up the skies in some of Syriaís biggest cities after Trump announced the lifting of sanctions. Billboards were erected thanking Trump and Prince Mohammed.

ìI donít know how life would be without sanctions,î said Ranim Sakhal, who said she has lived under sanctions since she was born in the 1970s. ìThe country has been suffocating.î

ìPeople are optimistic and our dream is for Arab countries to help, which is something we havenít seen for years because of Basharís rivalry with Arab leaders,î Sakhal added.

Syriaís currency, the Lira, rose by as much as 27% against the US dollar following the announcement. The countryís economy and trade minister, Mohammad Nidal al-Shaar, shed tears live on air with Saudi outlet Al Arabiya, as he underscored that Syria is ìnow entering a new phase.îBut the optimism is not universal. The lifting of sanctions would go far in giving legitimacy to Sharaaís new regime, and some in Syria are concerned about how minorities will be treated by the former jihadists.

ìWe are glad about itÖthank God. After all these years the economy could be revitalized. The prices are very high, products are unavailable so, God willing, it will be the beginning of economic improvement in the country,î George, a resident of Damascus who declined to share his last name, told CNN. The lifting of sanctions however shouldnít be construed as a tacit approval of the regime without bringing to justice those involved in the killing of minorities, he said.

ìWe face a number of extremist groups that restrict freedoms,î he said. ìIf a guy and a girl are seen together in public, the guy could be detained and just disappear. Men can be beaten for wearing shortsÖ itís an extreme infringement on personal freedoms.î

In March, armed men loyal to the new Syrian regime carried out field executions and spoke of purifying the country after a crackdown against remnants of the former Assad regime spiraled into communal killings against the Alawite minority. The United Nations said at the time that entire families, including women and children, were killed during the violence.

An opportunity for Saudi Arabia
For decades, Gulf Arab states were left out of Syria as their rival Iran expanded its influence in the country through its alliance with the Assad regime.

A decade-long civil war in Syria severely strained relations between Damascus and most Arab states, eventually culminating in Syriaís expulsion from the Arab League. Over the past few years, Gulf states began mending fences with the Assad regime and were leading the effort to rehabilitate him until he was abruptly ousted from power in December. Since then, Saudi Arabia and Qatar doubled down on getting the new regime re-integrated into the international community.

Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan announced on Wednesday that Riyadh will be at the ìforefrontî of Syriaís economic revival. Its efforts could allow it to become a significant player in the country and expand its influence there for the first time.

ìSyria will not be alone. Saudi ArabiaÖ will be at the forefront of the supporters to that economic awakeningÖ (Syria) needs a push, and it will receive that push from its brothers in the region,î bin Farhan said at a news conference on Wednesday.

Hasan Alhasan, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said Saudi Arabia has ìgeostrategic interests in the Middle Eastî that can be achieved through support for the current Syrian regime.

ìSaudi Arabia wants Syria to be stable, it recognizes that the only way in which you can get to a stable Syria is by providing the current administration with the economic resources and tools to deliver a so-called victory,î he said.
Defying Israel
During the Biden administration, the US and Saudi Arabia were close to reaching a comprehensive security and economic agreement that would have led to the normalization of relations between the kingdom and Israel.

Despite Trumpís desire for Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel, no such normalization materialized during his visit to Riyadh. Instead, the president said he would establish ties with Sharaa, a move that defied Israel, which has repeatedly bombed Syria and seized more of its territory since the fall of Assad.

An Israeli official told CNN that when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Trump in Washington in April, he asked the president not to remove sanctions on Syria, saying he feared it would lead to a repeat of the events of October 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants attacked Israel.

Netanyahu had taken an aggressive stance with Sharaa and his new government. In the days that followed Assadís ouster, he ordered an unprecedented ground push into Syria, driving Israeli forces deeper into the country than ever before and upending Israelís 50-year tacit dÈtente with the Assads.

The escalation quickly abandoned Netanyahuís initial pledge to practice ìgood neighborlinessî to the new Syria. Hundreds of airstrikes targeted the remnants of Assadís weaponry, particularly its chemical weapons, to prevent them from falling into the hands of militant groups, and Israeli forces seized Mount Hermon, Syriaís highest peak, and a strategically vital position overlooking Israel, Lebanon, and Syria.

ìWe toppled the Assad regime, which essentially was used as the land link between Iran and Hezbollah in Lebanon,î Netanyahu said in a video statement last week.

After meeting Sharaa on Wednesday, Trump heaped praise on him, calling him a ìgreat young attractive guy,î with a ìvery strong pastî who is ìa fighter.î The new Syrian President, he said, has ìgot a real shot at pulling it together.î",5/15/2025,World,Mostafa Salem,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/14/middleeast/syria-trump-meeting-analysis-intl,,,,,,,,,,,,us president donald trump wednesday tea

Israel hits Gaza hospital as strikes resume following hostage release,"Israel struck a hospital in Gaza early Tuesday, a day after briefly pausing military activity for the release of Israeli-American Edan Alexander by Hamas.

The Israeli military resumed strikes in Gaza about an hour after Alexander left the territory, hitting the Al Daraj neighborhood in northern Gaza on Monday evening, before striking the Nasser medical complex in southern Gaza on Tuesday, according to hospital officials.

The IDF strike targeted the surgical ward on the hospitalís third floor, which is now ìcompletely out of service,î killing two patients and wounding medical staff, Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) said.

The target of the strike was Hassan Eslaiah, a prominent Gaza photojournalist who Israel accuses of being a terrorist. He was being treated at the hospital after being wounded in an earlier targeted Israeli airstrike in April.The IDF has accused Eslaiah of taking part in the attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023, and of belonging to Hamasí Khan Younis Brigade, although it has not provided evidence to support those claims.

In a statement following Tuesdayís strike, it described him as working ìunder the guise of a journalistî and said that it had eliminated him and other ìsignificant Hamas terroritsî in a ìprecise strike.îEslaiah crossed into Israel on October 7, 2023, documenting the attacks in photographs that were published by multiple major news organizations. He had previously said he had no forewarning of the attacks and rushed to the scene to document a major news event alongside other photojournalists.

CNN, along with other news organizations, had periodically used material provided by Eslaiah. CNN cut ties with him in November 2023 after new allegations emerged of links to Hamas. CNN said he was not working with the network on October 7, 2023.

Eslaiah said from his hospital bed in April that he faced ìfalse allegationsî from the IDF and that he was ìnot fighting or anything.î

The Ramallah-based Palestinian Journalists Protection Center condemned Eslaiahís killing, demanding an international investigation into what they described as a ìheinous assassination.î The center called Eslaiahís killing the ìdeliberate targeting of the voice of truth.îThe Nasser hospital strike on Tuesday is the latest example of deliberate Israeli attacks on medical facilities in Gaza, for which Israel has been accused of violating international law.

Hospitals are entitled to special protections during armed conflict under international humanitarian law and can only be targeted under extremely limited circumstances, such as if they are being used to actively commit ìan act harmful to the enemy,î according to the Geneva Conventions.

The latest attack on Nasser hospital ìtotally destroyedî two patient rooms, partially damaged three others and a nursing station, according to MAPís medical activity coordinator who is based at Nasser Hospital.

ìThe extension of the intensive care unit, which contains three ICU beds, was also affected ñ its electrical and oxygen systems were damaged in the strike ñ rendering the entire section non-operational,î the coordinator said in a statement provided by MAP.

The strike adds to an already rapidly deteriorating situation for Gazaís medical facilities.

Nasser hospitalís medical director Dr. Atef Al-Hout said the hospital is rapidly running out of fuel to power its generators amid Israelís now 10-week blockade of the strip.

Following the release of Alexander, the Israeli American hostage, the United States is renewing its push for a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.

An Israeli delegation was set to fly to Qatar on Tuesday to resume negotiations, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed those talks will continue ìunder fire,î with no slowdown in Israeli strikes expected without a deal.",13-May-25,World,Oren Liebermann,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/13/middleeast/israel-strike-gaza-hospital-eslaiah-intl,,,,,,,,,,,,israel struck hospital gaza early tuesday day briefly pausing military activity release israeliamerican edan alexander hamas israeli military resumed strikes gaza hour alexander left territory hitting al daraj neighborhood northern gaza monday evening striking nasser medical complex southern gaza tuesday according hospital officials idf strike targeted surgical ward hospital‚Äôs third floor now ‚Äúcompletely service‚Äù killing two patients wounding medical staff medical aid palestinians map said target strike hassan eslaiah prominent gaza photojournalist israel accuses terrorist treated hospital wounded earlier targeted israeli airstrike aprilthe idf accused eslaiah taking part attacks israel october belonging hamas‚Äô khan younis brigade although provided evidence support claims statement following tuesday‚Äôs strike described working ‚Äúunder guise journalist‚Äù said eliminated ‚Äúsignificant hamas terrorits‚Äù ‚Äúprecise strike‚Äùeslaiah crossed israel october documenting attacks photographs published multiple major news organizations previously said forewarning attacks rushed scene document major news event alongside photojournalists cnn along news organizations periodically used material provided eslaiah cnn cut ties november new allegations emerged links hamas cnn said working network october eslaiah said hospital bed april faced ‚Äúfalse allegations‚Äù idf ‚Äúnot fighting anything‚Äù ramallahbased palestinian journalists protection center condemned eslaiah‚Äôs killing demanding international investigation described ‚Äúheinous assassination‚Äù center called eslaiah‚Äôs killing ‚Äúdeliberate targeting voice truth‚Äùthe nasser hospital strike tuesday latest example deliberate israeli attacks medical facilities gaza israel accused violating international law hospitals entitled special protections armed conflict international humanitarian law can targeted extremely limited circumstances used actively commit ‚Äúan act harmful enemy‚Äù according geneva conventions latest attack nasser hospital ‚Äútotally destroyed‚Äù two patient rooms partially damaged three others nursing station according map‚Äôs medical activity coordinator based nasser hospital ‚Äúthe extension intensive care unit contains three icu beds also affected ‚Äì electrical oxygen systems damaged strike ‚Äì rendering entire section nonoperational‚Äù coordinator said statement provided map strike adds already rapidly deteriorating situation gaza‚Äôs medical facilities nasser hospital‚Äôs medical director dr atef alhout said hospital rapidly running fuel power generators amid israel‚Äôs now week blockade strip following release alexander israeli american hostage united states renewing push ceasefire agreement israel hamas israeli delegation set fly qatar tuesday resume negotiations israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu vowed talks continue ‚Äúunder fire‚Äù slowdown israeli strikes expected without deal
Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander returns to Israel after Hamas release," Edan Alexander, the last known living American hostage in Gaza, was released by Hamas and reunited with his family on Monday, ending an 18-month ordeal that began with the militant groupís October 7 attack.

Hamas announced Sunday night it had agreed to free Alexander, 21, after several days of talks with the United States, which bypassed Israel, and formed part of an effort to reach a ceasefire and resume the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza.

Alexander, wearing a black Adidas t-shirt and a baseball cap, was photographed during his handover to the Red Cross, shortly before his convoy left Khan Younis and headed towards Israel. He later arrived at an Israeli military base for a medical assessment and a long-awaited reunion with his family.


Alexander had spoken to his mother, Yael, on the phone after Hamas released him. Footage shared by the Israel Defense Forces showed Steve Witkoff, the US Middle East envoy, handing a phone to Yael.

ìYouíre out, my soul, youíre out!î she exclaimed in the emotional clip. ìEverythingís alright, youíre fine, youíre safe, youíre home. Everything is good. Youíve got this. Youíre strong. Weíre meeting soon.îFollowing a medical evaluation, Alexanderís condition appeared ìstable over all,î Professor Gil Fire from Tel Avivís Sourasky Medical Center said in a statement Tuesday. Alexander was born in the same hospital, according to the doctor, who added that the team there would further assess the full medical implications of his prolonged captivity in the coming days.In Tel Aviv, Alexander was shown holding US and Israeli flags as he embraced members of his family. The reunion comes as US President Donald Trump embarks on a Middle East tour, with stops planned in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.

The Trump administration had circumvented Israel to seal the deal with Hamas to free Alexander, with Trump framing it as a step ìto put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones.î

A New Jersey native, Alexander was serving in the Israeli military near the Gaza border when he was abducted by Hamas on October 7, 2023. Yael described her son as ìsuch an American kid, full of life, very funny, very friendlyî in an interview with CNN in March.

Following Alexanderís release, 58 hostages are still being held in Gaza, with at least 20 believed to be alive. Among the deceased hostages are four American citizens, including husband and wife Gadi Haggai and Judi Weinstein Haggai, as well as soldiers Itay Chen and Omer Neutra.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Monday ìa very emotional moment,î effusively praising Trump for securing Alexanderís release and defending his ongoing campaign in Gaza.

ìThis was achieved thanks to our military pressure and the diplomatic pressure applied by President Trump. This is a winning combination,î Netanyahu said.

ìI spoke with President Trump today. He told me ëI am committed to Israel. I am committed to continuing to work with you in close cooperationí ñ- in order to achieve all of our war objectives: Releasing all of the hostages, and defeating Hamas,î his statement continued. ìThis goes together. They are combined with each other.îA crowd gathered in Tel Avivís ìHostage Squareî to watch his release take place. They cheered as it became clear that Alexander was handed over to Israeli forces.

Alexanderís mother boarded a flight to Israel on Sunday night to meet her son after his release. A photo posted by US Special Envoy for Hostage Response Adam Boehler showed Yael Alexander on a commercial flight with the envoyís team.

Alexanderís parents, Yael and Adi, thanked Trump, Witkoff and Boehler for their role in bringing their son home, during a speech at Sourasky Medical Center on Tuesday. Neither mentioned Netanyahu.

His father said Edan would soon be returning to the United States, ìto watch his little brother play basketball and reunite with his friends in New Jersey.î

ìHeís 21 now and those happy times may include a beer or two, but we will never forget the first beer he had on the rooftop of this very building since his release,î Adi Alexander added.

ëMonumental newsí
Trump hailed the development as ìmonumental newsî in a post on Truth Social, where he described Alexanderís release by Hamas as a ìstep taken in good faith toward the United States and the efforts of the mediators ñ Qatar and Egypt ñ to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones.î

Hamas leader Mahmoud Mardawi told the Hamas-affiliated Al Aqsa TV that the militant group, classified as a terrorist organization by the US and Israel, directly negotiated with the US to free Alexander in exchange for the resumption of humanitarian aid into Gaza.

Witkoff told CNN the talks with Hamas were indirect.
Alexander was last seen in a proof-of-life video in mid-April in which he appealed directly to Trump for help in securing his release. Just days later, Hamas claimed they had lost contact with the group of militants holding Alexander.

Gaza is on the brink of famine as Israelís blockade of humanitarian aid and commercial goods stretches into its second month, depleting food warehouses and soup kitchens, and sending the cost of basic goods skyrocketing.

Israel says it cut off the entry of humanitarian aid to pressure Hamas to release hostages. But international organizations say its actions violate international law, with some accusing Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war ñ a war crime.Israel has not said if it will resume humanitarian aid into Gaza.

Netanyahuís office said in a statement on Monday that Israel has not committed to a ceasefire, nor the release of any Palestinian prisoners, only to ìa safe corridor that will allow for Edanís release.î

In a post on social media Sunday night, Trump said he hoped the release would lead to the ìend (of) this brutal conflict.î But the long-time Israeli prime minister has said that ìnegotiations will take place under fire.î

Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah, said in a Monday statement welcomed efforts to halt the war and issued rare praise for Trump.

Abbas ìcommended US President Donald Trump for his position, in which the latter hopes to bring an end to the vicious conflict and the war that has been going on for two years,î the statement from his office said.

Alexanderís parents had fought tirelessly for his release. Speaking to CNN in March, Yael said she prayed and hoped she would see her son again.

"One in five people in Gaza face starvation, report warns, as Israel months-long blockade continues","One in five people in the Gaza Strip are facing starvation as the entire territory edges closer to famine, a new United Nations-backed report warns, after nearly three months of Israelís blockade of critically needed humanitarian aid.

The warning comes as the UN and several NGOs, as well as civilians in Gaza, say the situation has deteriorated since Israel launched its renewed assault on the enclave in March, as residents struggle to access food, medicine and clean water.The enclaveís entire population is experiencing ìhigh levels of acute food securityî and the territory is at ìhigh riskî of famine, the most severe type of hunger crisis, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said in its latest report Monday.


ìGoods indispensable for peopleís survival are either depleted or expected to run out in the coming weeks,î the IPC said. Food is running out, and what little is left is being sold at exorbitant prices that few can afford, it said.

Israel imposed a humanitarian blockade on Gaza on March 2, cutting off food, medical supplies, and other aid to the more than 2 million Palestinians who live in the territory. Israel says the blockade, along with the militaryís expansion of its bombardment of Gaza, is intended to pressure Hamas to release hostages held in the enclave ñ but international organizations say it violates international law, with some accusing Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war.There is a ìhigh riskî that famine will occur between now and the end of September, the IPC report warned, leaving most people in Gaza without access to food, water, shelter, and medicine.ìOnly an immediate and sustained cessation of hostilities and the resumption of humanitarian aid delivery can prevent a descent into famine,î the report said.

Under the IPC system ñ a five-phase scale used to measure the severity of food insecurity ñ a famine can only be declared if data shows certain thresholds are met. Those conditions are: at least 20% of all households must face an extreme food shortage, 30% or more of children must be acutely malnourished, and at least 2 in every 10,000 people die every day because of outright starvation or the interaction of malnutrition and disease.The first threshold has already been met, according to the IPC. Nearly 469,500 people ñ around 22% of the population - will likely experience ìcatastrophicî food insecurity, the highest phase on the IPC scale, between May and September, the report said.

David Mencer, a spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuís office, said Monday that ìfamine has never happenedî in Gaza, despite IPC warnings, and that if there is hunger in Gaza, it is caused by Hamas depriving civilians of humanitarian aid.

Whilst largely pinning the blame on Hamas for rising hunger levels, US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee on Friday acknowledged the rapidly deteriorating situation in Gaza, telling CNN: ìIf there wasnít a humanitarian crisis, there wouldnít be an effort to try to deal with it. So, the answer is, obviously yes, there is a humanitarian crisis.î

Since March, Israelís renewed assault has displaced more than 430,000 people, the report said, disrupting essential services and the distribution of critical supplies.All 25 bakeries run by the UNís World Food Programme (WFP) were forced to shutter at the beginning of April due to lack of supplies, and food is running out at most of the 177 hot meal kitchens, according to the IPC report. And food prices are soaring.

Prices for flour have increased 3,000% since February and 55-pound sack of wheat flour can run anywhere between $235 and $520, the report said.

At a Monday press conference, the UN Secretary Generalís spokesperson StÈphane Dujarric said only ìabout 260,000 meals have been prepared and delivered across the Gaza Stripî on Monday, which is a 70% reduction since last Wednesday.

According to the spokesperson, the blockade, which has passed 70 days, has depleted UN agenciesí food reserves. ìStocks have run out, bakeries have shut down, community kitchens are closing daily, and people are starving,î he said.

Pregnant women and children among the most at risk
Children and pregnant women are at particularly high risk. Nearly 71,000 cases of acute malnutrition among children under five are expected between April 2025 and March 2026, the report said. And nearly 17,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women will need treatment for acute malnutrition, it said.

During the nineteen months since Israel launched its assault on Gaza in the wake of the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel, people have resorted to scavenging for food, eating grass and animal feed, and drinking polluted water. Starving mothers have been unable to produce enough milk to feed their babies and parents have scrambled to keep their children alive, parents and doctors told CNN.

Imran Rajab, a mother living in Gaza city, told CNN earlier this month she was forced to bake bread using flour from a garbage dumpster to feed her six children.ìMy kids are vomiting after they eat it. It smells horrible,î Rajab said. ìBut what else can I do? What will I feed my children if not this?î

Dr. Amjad Al-Muzaini, a gynecologist working in Gaza City, said women in Gaza are forced to choose between feeding their children or caring for their own health. Most often, they sacrifice their own well-being to ensure survival, he said.

While doing cesarean surgeries, women were found to have severely deteriorated intestinal and uterine tissues, Al-Muzaini said, likely the effects of eating poor-quality and mainly canned foods.The WFP has said recently it is ready to surge enough aid into Gaza to feed the entire population for up to two months. UNRWA, the main UN agency supporting Palestinians, said it has nearly 3,000 trucks filled with aid waiting to cross into Gaza that is currently blocked by Israel.

ìFamilies in Gaza are starving while the food they need is sitting at the border,î the WFPís Executive Director, Cindy McCain said on X. ìBut WFP hasnít been able to get new aid in since 2 March.î

ìIf we wait for famine to be officially confirmed, it will be TOO LATE,î she said.

Israel launched its war in Gaza following Hamasí October 2023 attack in which militants killed 1,200 people and took 251 hostage. Since then, Israelís military campaign has killed almost 53,000 Palestinians. Since Israel resumed its bombardment in March, more than 2,500 Palestinians have been killed, according to figures provided by the Ministry of Health in Gaza.",13-May-25,World,"Lex Harvey, Abeer

Trump Middle East trip leaves Netanyahu watching from the sidelines again,"The first stop was Riyadh.

Just a few months into his new administration, the president of the United States met the king of Saudi Arabia as part of an effort to push forward relations with the Arab world.

From there, it was off to another regional capital, where the leader of the free world gave a speech about a new vision for the Middle East.

Conspicuously missing from the itinerary was a stop in Israel.

The year was 2009, and the president was Barack Obama. His decision not to visit Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had just returned to office, was viewed as an insult. It marked the beginning of what many to this day see as Obamaís fractured relationship with Israel, and particularly with the countryís longest-serving leader.But as President Donald Trump prepares for his first visit to the region in his second term, the same elephant sits in the same corner of the Oval Office. Trumpís itinerary includes Saudi Arabia ñ where heíll arrive early Tuesday local timeñ Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.

The White House has called it a ìhistoric return to the Middle Eastî and promised ìa shared vision of stability, opportunity and mutual respect.î Israel is once again not on the itinerary. And after Trump blindsided Israel several times already ñ announcing talks with Iran, a deal with Yemenís Houthi rebels, and direct talks with Hamas ñ Israeli officials are concerned another surprise could be coming.

ëWithout results, heís not comingí
Israeli officials tried to inquire about the possibility of a stop in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv during Trumpís trip, according to a source familiar with the matter. But the president doused the flicker of those hopes last week when he said he had no plans to stop in Israel.

ìWe will be doing it at some point,î Trump said. ìBut not for this trip.î

Trump might have been persuaded to add the visit to his itinerary if he could claim some sort of victory, whether it be a ceasefire agreement in Gaza, a humanitarian aid plan, or something else. But with Israel poised to expand its war in Gaza, there are no such deliverables. Even with the release of hostage Edan Alexander on Monday, prospects for a comprehensive ceasefire still seem distant.ìWithout results, heís not coming (to Israel),î said the source.

Netanyahu prided himself on being the first world leader to visit Trump in his second term in February. On his second visit, in April, he became the first leader to try to begin negotiations for a new trade deal after Trump announced sweeping tariffs on imports. The prime minister left the White House without a trade deal and with a new concern: Trumpís shock announcement that the US would begin negotiating a new nuclear deal with Iran.

The problem for Netanyahu is that he has little leverage in Washington right now, said Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat.

ìThereís nothing that Netanyahu has that Trump wants, needs or (that he) can give him, as opposed to, say, the Saudis, the Qataris, (or) the Emiratis,î Pinkas told CNN. The wealthy Arab nations have pledged trillions of dollars in US investments and may announce major weapons purchases, which Trump can tout as a victory for American manufacturing.

Despite years of being perhaps Trumpís most vocal international supporter, Netanyahu has few cards left to play, Pinkas said. Under Democratic administrations, Netanyahu has used his Republican supporters to put pressure on the White House. But Netanyahu has never criticized Trump openly, and heís unlikely to start.

ìHeís got nothing right now,î Pinkas said.

ëA policy of surprisesí
As Trumpís visit to the region nears, Israeli officialsí concerns about what it will bring have only grown.

In the weeks leading up to his trip, Trump has made a series of moves that have left the Israeli prime minister looking little more than a frustrated bystander. Trump has pursued negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program that donít preclude the possibility of Tehran maintaining some civilian nuclear capabilities; he agreed to a ceasefire with the Houthis that doesnít halt the Yemeni groupís attacks on Israel; and according to a Reuters report is also no longer demanding that Saudi Arabia normalize relations with Israel as a condition to facilitating a Saudi civil nuclear program.
And on Sunday, the Trump administration bypassed Israel to seal a deal with Hamas to free Edan Alexander, the last known living American hostage in Gaza, with Trump framing it as a step ìto put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones.î

Israeli officials are now concerned what a week spent meeting with and being feted by Gulf leaders ñ all of whom have been critical of Israelís military assault in Gaza and its ongoing humanitarian blockade of the strip ñ will mean for Trumpís posture vis-‡-vis the war and ceasefire negotiations.Leading up to Trumpís trip, the US has been heavily pressing Egypt and Qatar to convince Hamas to agree to the release of some hostages, a source familiar with the negotiations said, in exchange for several weeks of ceasefire and the entry of humanitarian aid.

The Trump administration now appears to be aiming even higher. Another source familiar with the matter tells CNN the release of Alexander will lead to ìimmediate peace deal negotiations.î

A comprehensive agreement to end the war has remained out of reach, but Trump has made clear that that is his goal.

ìHopefully this is the first of those final steps necessary to end this brutal conflict,î Trump said on social media on Sunday.

The result is that Trump and Netanyahu seem to be more at odds than ever, a situation that comes shortly after Netanyahu doubled down on the war and made explicitly clear he believes defeating Hamas is more important than securing the release of the hostages. If a deal with Hamas for the return of more hostages seems within reach, the US will drive up the pressure on Israel to accept it, another source familiar with the matter said.

Until now, there were major doubts about whether Hamasí leader in Gaza, Mohammad Sinwar, would agree to a limited deal. But Hamas seems to have shrewdly outplayed Israel this time around when it comes to Trump.

And Trumpís visit to the region will serve as a pressure point to potentially unlock a deal.

Trump moving forward ëlike a bulldozerí
ìThere has to be a practice of no surprisesî on either side, said Dan Shapiro, a former US Ambassador to Israel and senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington, DC. ìOtherwise, the trust that is so essential for this partnership breaks down really, really quickly.îTrump is moving forward ìlike a bulldozerî for what he wants, Shapiro told CNN, and that wish list currently includes progress on a ceasefire deal and a hostage release. Netanyahuís tendency to drag his feet on major decisions and his history of prioritizing his own political survival appear to have contributed to the White Houseís willingness to forgo consultation with Israel on key decisions, he said.

ìHeís clearly frustrated with Netanyahu, as every other president whoís worked with Netanyahu has been,î Shapiro said.

Meanwhile, Trumpís man in Jerusalem, US Ambassador Mike Huckabee, has tried to downplay speculation about a rift between the two leaders, and said he would ìfully expectî Trump to visit Israel this year.

ìNo president has ever cared as much and done as much as President Trump has for the state of Israel,î Huckabee told Israelís Channel 13 News in an interview aired Saturday evening. ìAnd his relationship with the prime minister is, I think, remarkable.î

Israelis see it differently.

The front page of the prominent Yedioth Ahronot newspaper last Thursday showed a cartoon of Trump with the headline ìA policy of surprises.î As Trump prepares a soup, Netanyahu sits nervously in the background.

Even the ardently pro-Trump Israel HaYom newspaper has keyed in on the apparent rift with Netanyahu. Columnist Shai Golden wrote in an opinion article over the weekend, ìThe old saying ëBe careful what you wish for, you might just get ití perfectly captures the trap Netanyahu has fallen into with

Trump is visiting three of the world richest nations. Here what on their wish list,"Three energy-rich Gulf Arab nations are racing to turn their influence over Donald Trump into tangible gains with the president set to visit this week.

They have built personal ties with the president and collectively pledged trillions in US investments while casting themselves as key intermediaries in conflicts Trump wants to resolve, from Gaza to Ukraine and Iran.

Now, theyíre being rewarded with the privilege of hosting Trumpís first state visit of his second term. The US president is set to land in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, followed by visits to Qatar and then the United Arab Emirates that stretch until May 16.
ìIn Trumpís book, the Gulf states tick all the right boxes,î Hasan Alhasan, senior fellow for Middle East policy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Bahrain, told CNN. They ìpledge to invest trillions in the US economy and spend colossal amounts on US weapons systems.î

Behind this carefully crafted strategy of wooing Trump is a desire from Gulf states to solidify and formalize their positions as the USí indispensable security and economic partners, and extract as much benefit for themselves as they can.US-Gulf relations have improved significantly since Trump returned to office. Frustrated at the perceived lack of US interest in their needs under the Biden administration, Saudi Arabia and the UAE had sought to diversify their military, technological and economic ties. With Trump in office, they see what one Gulf official called a ìonce-in-a-lifetime opportunityî to achieve his countryís objectives.

From their perspective, now is the time to cement ties with Washington, and even ìsecure greater privileges in their relationship with the worldís most powerful nation,î Ebtesam AlKetbi, founder and president of the Emirates Policy Center think tank in Abu Dhabi, said.

Each of the three nations Trump is visiting has its own list of priorities. Hereís what they want from the US and how theyíre going about achieving it.

Sealing a US-Saudi security pact
ìSecurity, security and securityî is what Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states seek most from Trumpís visit, said Ali Shihabi, an author and commentator on the politics and economics of Saudi Arabia.

ìGulf States are looking for reassurance of the US security commitment to the Gulfís stability,î Shihabi told CNN. ìTrump has many priorities and has been known to lose interest quickly Ö and they want to keep him engaged.î

Last year, the US and Saudi Arabia came close to finalizing a landmark defense and trade pact ñ but the deal stalled over Saudi insistence that Israel commit to a path toward Palestinian statehood.

Firas Maksad, managing director for the Middle East and North Africa at Eurasia Group, told CNNís Becky Anderson that Trump is likely to move ahead with major deals regardless of normalization, which he said is ìdead.î
Riyadh is also seeking US cooperation to develop a civil nuclear program, but that has been held up over its insistence on enriching uranium domestically ñ raising concerns in the US and Israel over nuclear weapons proliferation. Uranium, when enriched to high levels, can be used to produce nuclear weapons.White House backing for a Saudi nuclear program could see American firms win lucrative contracts.

Riyadh appears to be framing its relationship with the US as a win-win. In March, Trump said heíd go to Saudi Arabia if it invests $1 trillion in the US. ìTheyíve agreed to do that, so Iím going to be going there,î he said.

While Saudi Arabia didnít confirm that figure, it announced plans in January to expand trade and investment with the US by $600 billion over four years, with potential for more.

But for Riyadh to diversify away from oil, it still needs to sell oil ñ at a healthy profit ñ to fund that transition. Recent price drops, driven in part by Trumpís tariffs, threaten to undermine those ambitions. Trump has made clear he wants oil prices lower, putting him at odds with Saudi Arabiaís need for high revenues to finance its economic transformation.

UAEís quest for AI dominance
Perhaps more than any other Gulf state, the UAE sees investment as central to its strategy for deepening ties with the US and securing returns ñ and it has money to back it up. Among the worldís richest countries per capita, it has pledged trillions in US investments. Abu Dhabi has even branded itself ìthe capital of capital.î

ìExpanding trade and investment is a way to reinforce this strategic partnership,î AlKetbi said. ìThe US remains a critical security guarantor for the Gulf region, while also offering a dynamic economy full of opportunities and capabilities that align with the long-term Gulf development plans.î",11-May-25,World,"Nadeen Ebrahim, Abbas Al Lawati",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/11/middleeast/trump-visit-gulf-arab-states-saudi-uae-qatar-intl,,,,,,,,,,,,three energyrich gulf arab nations racing turn influence donald trump tangible gains president set visit week built personal ties president collectively pledged trillions us investments casting key intermediaries conflicts trump wants resolve gaza ukraine iran now they‚Äôre rewarded privilege hosting trump‚Äôs first state visit second term us president set land saudi arabia tuesday followed visits qatar united arab emirates stretch may ‚Äúin trump‚Äôs book gulf states tick right boxes‚Äù hasan alhasan senior fellow middle east policy international institute strategic studies bahrain told cnn ‚Äúpledge invest trillions us economy spend colossal amounts us weapons systems‚Äù behind carefully crafted strategy wooing trump desire gulf states solidify formalize positions us‚Äô indispensable security economic partners extract much benefit canusgulf relations improved significantly since trump returned office frustrated perceived lack us interest needs biden administration saudi arabia uae sought diversify military technological economic ties trump office see one gulf official called ‚Äúonceinalifetime opportunity‚Äù achieve country‚Äôs objectives perspective now time cement ties washington even ‚Äúsecure greater privileges relationship world‚Äôs powerful nation‚Äù ebtesam alketbi founder president emirates policy center think tank abu dhabi said three nations trump visiting list priorities here‚Äôs want us they‚Äôre going achieving sealing ussaudi security pact ‚Äúsecurity security security‚Äù saudi arabia gulf states seek trump‚Äôs visit said ali shihabi author commentator politics economics saudi arabia ‚Äúgulf states looking reassurance us security commitment gulf‚Äôs stability‚Äù shihabi told cnn ‚Äútrump many priorities known lose interest quickly ‚Ä¶ want keep engaged‚Äù last year us saudi arabia came close finalizing landmark defense trade pact ‚Äì deal stalled saudi insistence israel commit path toward palestinian statehood firas maksad managing director middle east north africa eurasia group told cnn‚Äôs becky anderson trump likely move ahead major deals regardless normalization said ‚Äúdead‚Äù riyadh also seeking us cooperation develop civil nuclear program held insistence enriching uranium domestically ‚Äì raising concerns us israel nuclear weapons proliferation uranium enriched high levels can used produce nuclear weaponswhite house backing saudi nuclear program see american firms win lucrative contracts riyadh appears framing relationship us winwin march trump said he‚Äôd go saudi arabia invests trillion us ‚Äúthey‚Äôve agreed i‚Äôm going going there‚Äù said saudi arabia didn‚Äôt confirm figure announced plans january expand trade investment us billion four years potential riyadh diversify away oil still needs sell oil ‚Äì healthy profit ‚Äì fund transition recent price drops driven part trump‚Äôs tariffs threaten undermine ambitions trump made clear wants oil prices lower putting odds saudi arabia‚Äôs need high revenues finance economic transformation uae‚Äôs quest ai dominance perhaps gulf state uae sees investment central strategy deepening ties us securing returns ‚Äì money back among world‚Äôs richest countries per capita pledged trillions us investments abu dhabi even branded ‚Äúthe capital capital‚Äù ‚Äúexpanding trade investment way reinforce strategic partnership‚Äù alketbi said ‚Äúthe us remains critical security guarantor gulf region also offering dynamic economy full opportunities capabilities align longterm gulf development plans‚Äù

Pope Leo life in pictures,"Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost ó now known as Pope Leo XIV ó has been elected as the first-ever pontiff from the United States.

Leo, born in Chicago in 1955, served over a decade as a missionary in Trujillo, Peru, and then led the Diocese of Chiclayo, Peru, from 2014 to 2023. He most recently served as the prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops, a powerful Vatican office charged with recommending new bishop appointments.

The papal name of Leo is seen as a reflection of his commitment to the poor. The last pope to take the name Leo, Pope Leo XIII who served from 1878 to 1903, had a strong emphasis on workersí rights and Catholic social doctrine.

Leo is also the first pope of the Augustinian order, a global order named for St. Augustine. Speaking from the balcony of St. Peterís Basilica in his first address as pope, Leo quoted Augustine: ìFor you, I am a bishop, with you, after all, I am a Christian.î

Cardinal Robert Prevost, a 69-year-old from Chicago, was elected on the second day of the papal conclave. He took on the name Pope Leo XIV.

Thousands of people were in St. Peterís Square to greet the new pope, who appeared on the balcony of St. Peterís Basilica more than an hour after white smoke signaled his election.

In his speech, Leo outlined his vision for the Catholic Church as one that ìbuilds bridgesî and engages in conversation. He also called on the Catholic Church to be a ìsynodalî church, ìone which goes forward and which always seeks peace and to be close to those who suffer.î

The new pope is a leader with global experience. He spent much of his career as a missionary in South America and most recently led a powerful Vatican office for bishop appointments. He is expected to build on Pope Francisí reforms.

Leo worked for a decade in Trujillo, Peru, and was later appointed bishop of Chiclayo, another Peruvian city, where he served from 2014 to 2023.

The week in 37 photos,"Under bright blue skies in St. Peterís Square, tens of thousands of people flocked to the Vatican to say goodbye to Pope Francis on Saturday.

The beloved pontiff, the first Latin American pope in history, died earlier in the week at the age of 88.

The crowd included dozens of dignitaries, including heads of state and reigning monarchs.

Francis was a ìpope among the people, with an open heart towards everyone,î said Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, the 91-year-old dean of the College of Cardinals who presided over the liturgy.

After the bells of St. Peterís Basilica tolled to mark the end of the service, the popeís coffin was driven slowly through the streets of Rome to his final resting place at the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. About 150,000 people lined the 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) procession route from Vatican City through Rome.

Most intense fighting for years rocks Libyan capital,"The most intense clashes for years rocked Tripoli for a second night and continued into Wednesday morning, witnesses in the Libyan capital said, after Mondayís killing of a major militia leader set off fighting between rival factions.

The United Nations Libya mission UNSMIL said it was ìdeeply alarmed by the escalating violence in densely populated neighborhoods of Tripoliî and urgently called for a ceasefire.

The latest unrest in Libyaís capital could consolidate the power of Abdulhamid al-Dbeibah, prime minister of the divided countryís Government of National Unity (GNU) and an ally of Turkey.

Libya has had little stability since a 2011 NATO-backed uprising ousted longtime autocrat Muammar Gaddafi and the country split in 2014 between rival eastern and western factions, though an outbreak of major warfare paused with a truce in 2020.A major energy exporter, Libya is also an important way station for migrants heading to Europe and its conflict has drawn in foreign powers including Turkey, Russia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Its main oil facilities are located in southern and eastern Libya, far from the current fighting in Triopli.

While eastern Libya has been dominated for a decade by commander Khalifa Haftar and his Libyan National Army (LNA), control in Tripoli and western Libya has been splintered among numerous armed factions.Dbeibah on Tuesday ordered the dismantling of what he called irregular armed groups.

That announcement followed Mondayís killing of major militia chief Abdulghani Kikli, widely known as Ghaniwa, and the sudden defeat of his Stabilization Support Apparatus (SSA) group by factions aligned with Dbeibah.

The seizure of SSA territory in Libya by the Dbeibah-allied factions, the 444 and 111 Brigades, indicated a major concentration of power in the fragmented capital, leaving the Special Deterrence Force (Rada) as the last big faction not closely tied to the prime minister.",14-May-25,World,Mahmud Turkia,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/14/africa/intense-fighting-rocks-tripoli-intl,,,,,,,,,,,,intense clashes years rocked tripoli second night continued wednesday morning witnesses libyan capital said monday‚Äôs killing major militia leader set fighting rival factions united nations libya mission unsmil said ‚Äúdeeply alarmed escalating violence densely populated neighborhoods tripoli‚Äù urgently called ceasefire latest unrest libya‚Äôs capital consolidate power abdulhamid aldbeibah prime minister divided country‚Äôs government national unity gnu ally turkey libya little stability since natobacked uprising ousted longtime autocrat muammar gaddafi country split rival eastern western factions though outbreak major warfare paused truce major energy exporter libya also important way station migrants heading europe conflict drawn foreign powers including turkey russia egypt united arab emirates main oil facilities located southern eastern libya far current fighting triopli eastern libya dominated decade commander khalifa haftar libyan national army lna control tripoli western libya splintered among numerous armed factionsdbeibah tuesday ordered dismantling called irregular armed groups announcement followed monday‚Äôs killing major militia chief abdulghani kikli widely known ghaniwa sudden defeat stabilization support apparatus ssa group factions aligned dbeibah seizure ssa territory libya dbeibahallied factions brigades indicated major concentration power fragmented capital leaving special deterrence force rada last big faction closely tied prime minister
UN mission in Libya calls for de-escalation after fighting erupts in capital,"The United Nations mission in Libya called for de-escalation Monday after fighting erupted in the North African nationís capital.

The UN Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) is ìalarmed by the unfolding security situation in Tripoli with intense fighting with heavy weaponry in densely populated civilian areas,î it said in a post on X late Monday.

ìThe Mission calls on all parties to immediately cease fighting and restore calm, and reminds all parties of their obligations to protect civilians at all times,î UNSMIL added.

ìAttacks on civilians and civilian objects may amount to war crimes.î

Gunfire was heard in Tripoli as reports emerged that a prominent commander, Abdulghani Kikli of the Support Force Apparatus SSA, one of the capitalís most powerful armed groups, was killed, Reuters reported. The Support Force Apparatus SSA is a state-backed security institution affiliated with the Presidential Council, according to its website.

Libya has been embroiled in a political conflict since long-time dictator Moammar Gaddafi was overthrown in 2011, leading to the emergence of several armed groups.While a 2020 ceasefire brought some peace, the country remains fragile and divided, with the internationally recognized Government of National Unity (GNU) ruling in Tripoli and the northwest and the Government of National Stability ruling in Benghazi in the east.

Armed clashes have occasionally been reported, with major factions vying for control over Libyaís substantial oil and gas reserves.

Amid reports of violence, the GNUís health ministry told local hospitals and medical centers in Tripoli to prepare for emergencies, according to a post on its Facebook account.

The GNUís interior ministry called on citizens in a short statement to stay at home ìfor their own safety,î according to Reuters.

The University of Tripoli Presidency also announced on Facebook the suspension of all studies, exams, and administrative work until further notice.

The latest instability comes as the Trump administration mulls plans to deport migrants to Libya from the United States. CNN first reported the administration was communicating with Libya to have the country take migrants from the US.

The administration appeared to be moving forward with those plans as recently as Wednesday, when migrants believed to be bound for Libya sat for hours on a bus before abruptly being returned to a detention facility.

"Drone strikes pound Port Sudan, putting aid deliveries at risk","Explosions and fires rocked Sudanís main port city and wartime capital Port Sudan on Tuesday, a witness said, part of a days-long drone assault that has torched the countryís biggest fuel depot, damaging the most important gateway for foreign aid.

A massive column of black smoke billowed from the area around the port, a Reuters video showed, and the witness said blasts had been heard from other areas though it was not clear exactly where else had been hit.

Sudanís electricity company said a substation in the city was also hit, causing a complete power outage, part of a systematic assault on infrastructure.


Port Sudan had enjoyed relative calm since the civil war suddenly erupted in April 2023, becoming the base for the army-aligned government after the Sudanese armed forces lost control of much of the capital Khartoum at the start of the conflict to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).

Hundreds of thousands of displaced people have also sought refuge in the city, where United Nations officials, diplomats and agencies have also set up headquarters, making it the main base for aid operations in what the UN has called the worldís biggest humanitarian disasterPort Sudanís import and storage depots supply fuel across the country and the destruction of its facilities risks a major crisis, throttling aid deliveries by road and hitting electricity production and cooking gas supplies.
Port Sudanís import and storage depots supply fuel across the country and the destruction of its facilities risks a major crisis, throttling aid deliveries by road and hitting electricity production and cooking gas supplies.
Military sources have blamed the paramilitary RSF for the attacks on Port Sudan since Sunday, though the group has not yet claimed any responsibility for the strikes.

On Sunday drones struck a military base in the area near Sudanís only functioning international airport, and on Monday they targeted the cityís fuel depots. One of the targets was a major hotel near the residence of Sudanís military leader, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, witnesses said.

The attacks came after a military source said the army had destroyed an aircraft and weapons depots in the RSF-controlled Nyala airport in Darfur, the main stronghold of the paramilitary group.

Condemnation
The attacks have drawn condemnation from neighboring Egypt and Saudi Arabia, as well as expressions of concern from the UN.

Sudanís army-aligned government has accused the United Arab Emirates of backing the RSF, accusations that UN experts have found credible. The UAE has denied backing the RSF and the International Court of Justice on Monday said it could not rule in a case in which the government accused the UAE of fueling genocide.

The war, triggered by a dispute over a transition to civilian rule, has displaced over 12 million people and pushed half the population into acute hunger, according to the UN.

TikTok beauty influencer shot dead during live stream in Mexico,"Valeria Marquez was addressing her TikTok followers in a livestream from her beauty salon in Zapopan, Mexico, when someone arrived at her door to deliver a small parcel.

ìHeís a little piglet!î the 23-year-old beauty influencer exclaimed as she returned to her viewers and unwrapped the stuffed animal, smiling as she tossed her long blonde hair over her shoulder.

Moments later she was dead, slumped over in her chair with blood pooling on the desk in front of her, even as the livestream continued. The footage ended only when another person picked up her phone, their face momentarily showing to viewers.

According to the state of Jaliscoís Attorney Generalís office, Marquez was shot dead by a male intruder into her salon in a case it is investigating as a suspected femicide ñ the killing of a woman or girl for gender-based reasons.

The death of Marquez ñ a public figure with more than 100,000 Instagram followers ñ has sent shockwaves through a country that has long struggled with high levels of both homicide and violence against women.According to a spokesperson for the Jalisco Prosecutorís Office, the man accused of committing the crime showed up at the site of the murder before M·rquez had arrived and asked directly for her. He returned to the salon later that day, which is when the murder occurred, as recorded in the video, the spokesperson said.
The suspectís name has not been released, and the killing is not currently being investigated as related to drug cartels in the area, the spokesperson added.

Just days earlier, another woman ñ a mayoral candidate in the state of Veracruz ñ was also shot dead during a livestream, alongside three other people.

While not all homicides involving women are femicides, many are. In 2020, a quarter of female killings in Mexico were investigated as femicides, with cases reported in each one of Mexicoís 32 states, according to Amnesty International.

Last year, there were 847 reported cases of femicide nationwide ñ and 162 in the first three months of this year, according to Mexican government figures.

Mexicoís response to homicides in general is severely wanting, according to rights groups, who say too few investigations lead to prosecution.

ìIn 2022, around 4,000 women were killed in Mexico, which amounts to 12% of all homicides that year,î Human Rights Watch Americas Director Juanita Goebertus told CNN. ìAnd the rate of cases that lead to a verdict is around 67%.î

Canada Carney unveils new cabinet with  primary focus on economy amid US tariffs,"Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney unveiled his new cabinet at Rideau Hall in Ottawa on Tuesday, saying that his ministry will have a ìprimary focusî on the countryís economy after a whirlwind election catalyzed by tariffs and annexation threats from the United States.

ìCanadians elected this new government with a strong mandate to define a new economic and security relationship with the United States, to build a stronger economy, to reduce the cost of living, and to keep our communities safe,î Carneyís office said in a statement soon after the cabinet was sworn in.

The group of 28 ministers features a few notable shuffles, including Anita Anand replacing MÈlanie Joly as minister of foreign relations. Joly was made minister of industry.

ìWe have to address and come to a new arrangement with the Americans,î Carney said at a press conference after the swearing-in ceremony. ìBut our primary focus is on the economy, and our primary focus is on the Canadian economy.î

ìWe are at the start of an industrial transformation, the transformation of this economy, and Madame Joly, as minister of industry, is going to help lead that, in concert with the other members of the cabinet and myself,î Carney continued.
As for Canadaís changing relationship with the US, Carney said at the press conference that he would ìtake ultimate responsibilityî for all diplomacy with Washington, assisted by five other ministers: foreign affairs, finance, public safety, defense and Canada-US trade.That last portfolio is now led by Dominic LeBlanc, the former minister of international trade, now minister ìfor Canada-US trade, intergovernmental affairs, and one Canadian economy.î

During the campaign, Carney spoke often about creating ìone economy out of 13 (provinces and territories)î in the face of tariffs from the US and Canadaís own federal levies on interprovincial commerce. Again on Tuesday, Carney pledged that his new cabinet would fast-track legislation ìto eliminate all remaining federal barriers to internal trade as our contribution to building one Canadian economy out of 13.îSome ministers kept their portfolios. Chrystia Freeland, Carneyís former rival for the Liberal Party leadership race, will stay on as minister of transport. FranÁois-Philippe Champagne, who was part of the initial Canadian delegation to Washington during the first negotiations on US tariffs, remains minister of finance.

Several of the ministers previously served in the government of former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a fact quickly pointed out by the Liberalsí political rivals.

Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre argued in a press conference Tuesday that the presence of Trudeau-era figures in Carneyís cabinet indicates that the Liberals will only offer ìmore of the sameî for Canadians.

ìIn all, 14 Trudeau ministers are now in Carneyís cabinet,î said Poilievre. ìItís more of the same when Canada needs real change.î

"Jos Mujica, Uruguaymodest leader who transformed the country, dies at 89","Uruguayís former President JosÈ Mujica, a leftist icon known for his progressive social reforms, died on Tuesday at the age of 89.

ìIt is with profound sorrow that we announce the passing of our comrade Pepe Mujica,î Uruguayís President Yamand˙ Orsi announced on X.

ìPresident, activist, leader and guide. We will miss you very much, dear old man. Thank you for everything you gave us and for your profound love for your people,î said Orsi, who was close to the late leader. CNN has contacted the Uruguayan presidency for more information.

The folksy, former guerrilla is remembered for his modest lifestyle during his presidential term ñ famously shunning the presidential palace to carry out his duties from his rural farm.

He had been battling cancer for more than a year prior to his death, telling reporters in 2024 that he would fight on for as long as he could.

ìIíll continue to fight alongside my comrades, faithful to my way of thinking, and entertaining myself with my vegetables and my chickens,î he said. ìFor the rest, I am grateful, and after all, you canít take away what Iíve had.îA humble leader
ìPepeî Mujica, as he is more widely known, burst into the national scene in the 1960s as a leader of the leftist militant group Tupamaros, which waged an armed insurgency against the government in the 60s and 70s after being inspired by the Cuban Revolution.The uprising was put down by government forces during Uruguayís military dictatorship, and Mujica was subsequently imprisoned for nearly 15 years, enduring many forms of torture.

Mujica spoke of the horror of that period in 2020. ?ìBeing tied up with wire with my hands behind my back for six months; being thrown out of the truck for two or three days; going two years without being taken to the bathroom, having to bathe with a jar, a cup of water, and a handkerchief,î he said.He was released from prison in 1985 after democracy was restored to the country. Four years later, he and other members of Tupamaros founded the Movement of Popular Participation (MPP), a party under which he won several legislative elections.

In 2009, he launched his bid for president, winning in a runoff with more than 50% of the vote.

Under his watch, between 2010 and 2015, Uruguayís economy expanded, and he implemented several progressive reforms. Uruguay legalized abortion, gay marriage, and allowed the recreational use of cannabis, becoming the first country in the world to do so.

Mujicaís supporters regarded him as one of the humblest leaders the country has ever had, pointing to his decision to forgo the presidential palace and live in a rural farmhouse during his term.

In 2012, he gave CNN a tour of his farm, showing how he toiled the fields, planted fresh fruits and chrysanthemums, and drove around in an old Volkswagen Beetle.

"Divided by a border, united by fear: Kashmiris pick up the pieces after India-Pakistan step back from the brink","Mohammad Iqbal was working the nightshift at a power plant when he got a frantic call from his family saying artillery shells were exploding around their home.

ìI told them all to hunker down in one room together on the ground floor and hopefully things would become okay by morning,î he told CNN.

But dawn brought no relief from the shelling that would continue for four days as India and Pakistan fought their most intense conflict in decades, raising fears of an all-out war.

Iqbal, 47, lives near the town Poonch in India-administered Kashmir, a stoneís throw from the de-facto border with Pakistan, an area of pine-clad foothills and flowery meadows, backdropped by towering, icy peaks.

But the idyll is illusory ñ Kashmir is one of the worldís most militarized regions and the trigger for multiple wars between India and Pakistan, who both claim the territory in full but control only in part.Last week the nuclear-armed neighbors traded missiles, drones, and artillery shelling for four days following a massacre of tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month that New Delhi blamed on its neighbor, which Pakistan denies.

Two hours after the firing started last Wednesday, Iqbal got news his brother-in-lawís home had been hit.

The shell had exploded at a nearby water tank, obliterating windows and sending shards of glass flying, hitting his brother-in-law and niece.

What followed was a frantic scramble to get the wounded to the nearest hospital.

ìAs people started evacuating there were a few people in the village with cars so people just poured into whatever vehicle they could find,î Iqbal said.

ìFor a few hours it was difficult to locate everyone. People got split up. But finally at the hospital my family came together.î

There, he found his brother-in-law, who works as a policeman, critically wounded and medical staff struggling to treat the influx of casualties.Pakistan said on Tuesday that 40 civilians had been killed and 121 wounded in Indian firing, and that 11 members of its armed forces had been killed. India has previously said 15 civilians were killed and 59 wounded and that it had lost five soldiers.

For the roughly 15 million people living in the contested region, the latest bout of hostilities has appeared to push a political solution for their home further away than ever.

But the immediate concern in both sides of Kashmir is how long the skies will stay quiet.

ìThere is an uneasy calm here,î Amir Choudhary, 25, from the town of Akhnoor in India-administered Kashmir told CNN on Sunday, hours after the ceasefire came into effect.

ìMarkets are open again and some people who had left have slowly started coming back,î he said.ìThere still is that anxiety about what might happen when night comes,î he added.

On the other side of the Line of Control, in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, Saima Ashraf shared those feelings.

ìUncertainty still prevails,î she said. ìMany believe it (the ceasefire) is not a permanent solution.î

Others are unclear about when they can return to their homes and villages.

ìMany of them are waiting to see how the situation develops before making a decision about returning,î Akhtar Ayoub, a local administration official in Pakistanís Neelum Valley, told Reuters.

Raja Shoukat Iqbal, who lives near the de facto border, described the ceasefire as ìessential for the people of Kashmirî who he said were paying a high price on both sides of the divide.

ìThis peace was also necessary on the international level because both countries are nuclear powers, any mistakes or anger of any country could cause the deaths of two billion people,î he posited.
Kashmir has been a flashpoint since 1947, when British India was hastily divided into two by its former colonial rulers.

What followed was the birth of two nations: Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan. Millions suddenly found themselves on the ìwrongî side of the new border, leading to a frantic and bloody mass migration that tore communities asunder.

Exiled Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina party barred from election,"Bangladeshís Election Commission has cancelled the registration of the former ruling party of ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, preventing it from participating in the next national election, which is expected to be held by June next year.

The decision on Monday came hours after the countryís interim government headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus issued an official notification banning the Awami League party and its affiliated bodies from conducting activities online and elsewhere.

Mondayís formal notification from the Ministry of Home Affairs was issued two days after the interim Cabinet decided to ban all activities of the party under the countryís Anti-Terrorism Act until a special tribunal concludes a trial for the party and its leaders.

In the notification, the government said it outlawed all activities ìincluding any kind of publication, media, online and social mediaî as well as ìany kind of campaign, procession, meeting, gathering (or) conference until the trial of the leaders and activists Ö is completed.î

It said the decision was effective immediately.

Separately, the Election Commission said Monday it would not allow the Hasina-led party to contest the next election. Political parties must be registered with the Election Commission to take part in elections.A government adviser said Monday that anyone who posts comments online in support of the Awami League party would face arrest.

On Sunday, the Awami League accused the interim government of ìstoking divisionî and trampling on ìdemocratic normsî by banning its activities. It said in a statement that the ban ìstoked division within society, strangled democratic norms, fueled ongoing pogrom against dissenters and strangled inclusivity, all undemocratic steps.î

The Awami League is one of two major parties in Bangladesh, which has a fractious parliamentary democracy with a violent history of coups and political assassination.

Hasina, the daughter of Bangladeshís independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, fled the country on Aug. 5 last year and has been in exile in India since then along with many senior party colleagues and former Cabinet minsters and lawmakers. They have been accused of killing protesters during an uprising against Hasinaís 15-year rule in July-August last year.

The United Nations human rights office said in a report in February that up to 1,400 people may have been killed during three weeks of anti-Hasina protests. But the Office of the UN High Commissioner of Human Rights recommended in a report to ìrefrain from political party bans that would undermine a return to a genuine multi-party democracy and effectively disenfranchise a large part of the Bangladeshi electorate.îThe Awami League, which led a nine-month war against Pakistan for independence in 1971, has been under severe pressure since Hasinaís ouster. Protesters have attacked and torched many of its offices including its headquarters in Dhaka. It accuses the interim government of sponsoring mobs to attack the homes and businesses of their activists and leaders. It said thousands of its supporters have been arrested across the country and that many have been killed.

Yunus has said the next election will likely be held either in December or in June next year.

We hope sense will prevail Pakistan foreign minister says as delicate India-Pakistan ceasefire holds,"As tensions ratcheted up over the last week of fighting, Pakistan did not consider deploying nuclear warheads to strike India, the countryís foreign minister Ishaq Dar told CNN on Monday.

In his first interview since India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire Saturday, Dar said Islamabad ìhad no choiceî but to launch strikes in ìself-defenseî following Indiaís May 7 cross-border attacks.

Last weekís escalatory tit-for-tat strikes marked the worst fighting between the two nuclear-armed nations since 1971, killing dozens and deepening fears of a wider conflict.

Dar referred to Indiaís strikes as a ìwarî and a ìwishful attempt to establish its hegemonyî in the long-disputed Kashmir region ñ but said that the nuclear option was never on the table.

ìThere are certain times when you have to take very serious decisions,î he said, ìWe were very sure that our conventional capacity and capabilities are strong enough that we will beat them both in air and on ground.î
After the initial attack last Wednesday, Pakistan claimed it had used Chinese-made fighter jets to shoot down five Indian Air Force jets, including three Rafales, sophisticated French-made jets that New Delhi acquired only a few years ago. A French intelligence source told CNN that Pakistan had downed at least one Indian Rafale.

India has not responded to those claims, which CNN has been unable to verify.

Following several days of fighting, Islamabad and New Delhi agreed to a US-brokered truce on Saturday, as explosions reportedly ripped through parts of Kashmir over one final burst of strikes.

While the agreement has so far appeared to hold, Dar told CNN that long-term negotiations between the two parties are ìnot done yet.î

ìWe still hope sense will prevail,î he said.

Meanwhile, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday that India has ìonly paused our responsive attack on Pakistanís terror and military hubs.î

ìOperation Sindoor has drawn a new line under the fight against terrorism ñ this is a new phase, a new normal,î he said, adding, ìIf there is a terror attack on India, we will give a jaw-breaking response.î

ìIndia will not tolerate any nuclear blackmail,î Modi cautioned.

The Indian leader asserted the ferocity of his countryís attacks pushed Pakistan to look for ìways to save themselvesî by reaching a ceasefire deal.

ìThey were calling the world to reduce tensions after being completely destroyed,î he said.

Pakistanís Ministry of Foreign Affairs pushed back on Modiís comments in a Tuesday statement, calling them ìprovocative and inflammatory,î and a ìblatant lie.î

In Islamabad, when asked about the impetus for the unexpected deal, Dar told CNN that ìIt is in the interest of everybody to not delay or to leave such issues beyond a certain reasonable time.î

ì(The Indians) had seen what happened in the sky,î he added. ìThey could see how serious the damage was.îThere was no direct contact between Indian or Pakistani officials, Dar said, contradicting a previous assertion made by Indiaís director general of military operations, who reportedly received a message from his counterpart in Pakistan during the talks.

Instead, Dar said that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio passed on the message that India was ready to stop the fighting.

Rubio said in a Saturday statement that he and US Vice President JD Vance had spoken to the political and military leadership in India and Pakistan to secure agreement before the situation deteriorated further.

Dar told CNN on Monday that Pakistan was looking forward to establishing a path for long-term peace and security that would provide ìdignity for both sides.î

Calls for ëself-determinationí in Kashmir
The Muslim-majority region of Kashmir has been a flashpoint in India-Pakistan relations since both countries gained their independence from Britain in 1947.

The two nations to emerge from the bloody partition of British India ñ Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan ñ both claim Kashmir in full and, months after becoming independent, fought their first of three wars over the territory.

The divided region is now one of the most militarized places in the world.

Dar pointed to Kashmir as ìthe root cause of this regional instabilityî and called for the regionís ìfuture self-determination.î

India has long accused Pakistan of harboring militant groups in Kashmir that conduct attacks across the border against Indian security forces, a charge Islamabad has rejected.

India launched its cross-border strikes last week in the wake of a tourist massacre in the Indian administered part of Kashmir in April.Dar reiterated that Pakistan was not behind last monthís rampage, saying, ìWe condemn terrorism in all forms and all manifestations.î

He added that he believes US President Donald Trump supports Pakistanís antiterrorism efforts.

ìIf they didnít believe (in our efforts), they would not have cooperated the way (that they did),î Dar said, pointing to Trumpís social media post on ìfinding a solutionî to the Kashmir conflict.

"Missiles, drones and airstrikes, until a sudden ceasefire. How India and Pakistan agreed to an uneasy truce","India and Pakistan engaged in the most intense fighting in decades with four days of escalating conflict that included fighter jets, missiles and drones packed with explosives. It ended almost as abruptly as it began.

New details reveal how a flurry of phone calls and diplomacy ultimately brought about a truce between the nuclear-armed neighbors and historic foes.

And while the Indian and Pakistani accounts differ on some details, both sides agree the breakthrough started to come on Saturday afternoon.

The ceasefire between Islamabad and New Delhi, which according to Pakistani officials had been in the works for several days, was agreed to after a ìhotlineî message was sent from a top Pakistani military official to his Indian counterpart, Indiaís military said Sunday, offering new details about how the unexpected deal was struck.

In a briefing Sunday, Indiaís director general of military operations said that as officials were huddling Saturday ìto wargameî the early morningís strikes from Pakistan, he received a message from his counterpart in Pakistan seeking communications.

Pakistanís military confirmed Sunday that it reached out, but said it contacted intermediaries regarding a ceasefire with India. It did not specify which countries, although a Pakistani official involved in the talks told CNN it was the United States making the important calls Saturday.

During a call, held at 3:35 p.m. local time, a ceasefire agreement was reached, according to Indiaís director general of military operations, Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai. He said a further call would be held to ìdiscuss the modalities that would enable the longevityî of the agreement. Pakistan has not confirmed whether or not a call was held, but the official involved in the diplomatic efforts said Pakistan had received unspecified ìassurancesî from the US that India would abide by the ceasefire.

The latest details of how the agreement was reached, which was first announced by US President Donald Trump, give the clearest picture yet of how Islamabad and New Delhi directly communicated to agree on an end to the spiraling conflict amid growing international pressure.
On his Truth Social, Trump said Saturday the US had brokered an end to the fighting and congratulated the leaders of both countries for ìusing common sense and great intelligence.î While Islamabad praised US involvement, New Delhi has downplayed it ñ keen to portray the ceasefire as a victory and saying that the neighbors had worked together ìdirectlyî on the truce.

Indiaís director general of military operations, Ghai, said India approached Islamabad on Wednesday following its initial strikes to ìcommunicate our compulsions to strike at the heart of terror.î

India made a request ñ which was not specified - that was ìbrusquely turned down with an intimation that a severe response was inevitable and in the offing,î Ghai told reporters. The Pakistani military said that it was approached by India earlier in the week regarding a ceasefire.

ìThe Indians requested a ceasefire after the 8th and 9th of May after they started their operation. We told them we will communicate back after our retribution,î Pakistanís Lt. Gen. Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said during a news conference on Sunday. After Pakistanís military operation, ìwe reached the international interlocutors and we responded to the ceasefire request,î he said.

Speaking on Wednesday, after Indiaís initial strikes, a Pakistani official involved in diplomacy efforts said Pakistan was engaged with the US and that he hoped those conversations would bring positive results.

He said Pakistan was going to give diplomacy a chance and hold off on retaliation as the US and others tried diplomacy ñ though India claimed Pakistan repeatedly fired drones and artillery into its territory, something Islamabad has strenuously denied.

The Pakistani official said they were shocked when India attacked several Pakistani airbases early Saturday morning as they thought diplomacy was still in play. Pakistan immediately struck back, he said, harder than they had previously planned.

Pakistanís military called the strikes on multiple Indian military bases an ìeye for eyeî and said they targeted the Indian air bases used to launch missiles on Pakistan.

The escalatory strikes from both sides forced the existing diplomatic efforts into a high gear ñ including by the United States, China and Saudi Arabia - to broker an end to the fighting.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that he and Vice President JD Vance had spoken to the political and military leadership in India and Pakistan to secure an agreement before the situation deteriorated further.

Vance had pressed Indiaís Prime Minister Narendra Modi to find a potential ìoff-rampî to escalating tensions, according to multiple sources at Indiaís foreign ministry. Modi listened, but did not commit, the sources said.

Chinaís foreign minister Wang Yi also spoke separately to top officials in India and Pakistan and expressed Beijingís support for a ceasefire, according to readouts from Chinaís foreign ministry.

Just before 8 a.m. ET on Saturday, about 5 p.m. in India and Pakistan, Trump announced the ceasefire on Truth Social, writing: ìAfter a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE.î

Shortly after Trumpís post, both sides confirmed the truce.

Indiaís Foreign Ministry said the agreement was worked out ìdirectly between the two countries,î downplaying US involvement and contradicting Trumpís claim.

But Pakistani officials heaped praise on Washington. ìWe thank President Trump for his leadership and proactive role for peace in the region,î said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.

A Pakistani source familiar with the negotiations told CNN that the US ñ and Rubio in particular ñ was instrumental in striking the deal, painting a picture of talks that were in doubt with trust at a low ebb and missiles attacks from India only abating in the final few hours before the truce was confirmed.

Itís not surprising these bitter rivals give contradictory accounts of how a deal was struck.

India, which views itself as a regional superpower, has long been resistant to international mediation, whereas Pakistan, which is heavily dependent on foreign aid, tends to welcome it, analysts say.

The Indian militaryís latest account of what happened raises further questions as to what exactly was Washingtonís role in brokering the truce.

For India and Pakistan, the truce ñ which largely appears to be holding despite early accusations of each other violating the agreement ñ has brought much needed relief to both sides.",12-May-25,World,"Kunal Sehgal, Sophia Saifi, Alex Stambaugh, Nic Robertson, Matthew Chance",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/12/asia/india-pakistan-kashmir-ceasefire-intl-hnk,,,,,,,,,,,,india

"She escaped an avalanche and became the first woman to summit Everest. Today, few remember her name","It was May 4, 1975. The Japanese Womenís Everest Expedition team had been living at a high altitude for six weeks, and were less than a week away from their scheduled bid for the summit of Mount Everest. Exhausted, having established camp five at just below 8,000 meters on the south side of the mountain, Junko Tabei and her team descended to camp two at 6,300 meters to rest.In the early hours, tons of ice and snow engulfed the camp, burying several of the teammates. Crushed by the snow and ice, Tabei was unable to move. It took the strength of four Sherpas, the elite Nepali climbing guides assisting the expedition, to pull her out. Suffering severe bruising, Tabei argued that she did not need to be returned to base camp to recover, and would remain at camp two.

ìThere was no way I was leaving the mountain,î she later recalled in her memoir.

It had taken five years for this group ó the first all-women team ó to get to Everest. The pressure on them to succeed was immense, given the limited number of annual international permits to climb Mount Everest issued by the Nepali government. If they gave up, they might have to wait several years to make another attempt.

Meanwhile, on the Tibetan side of the mountain, Tabeiís team had competition. A 200-strong Chinese team was also working to place a woman on the summit at the same time.From the late 1950s, Tibetan women were recruited to participate in state-sponsored Chinese mountaineering expeditions. In 1958, Pan Duo had been selected to participate in the successful Chinese 1960 Everest expedition ó but was ordered to remain below 6,400 meters because above that height was ìa manís worldî. Nonetheless, Pan Duo ó referred to as ìMrs Phanthogî in some older accounts ó was celebrated in her country and elected deputy captain of the 1975 Chinese Everest Expedition.

Unfortunately, the Chinese team suffered a climbing accident resulting in the death of a team member. They retreated to recover ó only to be ordered by the Chinese government to ìclimb ahead of the Japanese women.î

They were too late. On May 16, 1975, the all-women Japanese expedition worked together to place Tabei on the summit of Everest. Two team members ó Tabei and Yuriko Watanabe ó had been nominated to make the summit attempt. However, other teammates were suffering from altitude sickness, so Watanabe was assigned to help return them to camp two.

The ascent Tabei was making was arduous. Given her injuries, it took great tenacity to muster the strength to continue. But finally, she took her last steps to the summit, becoming the first woman and 40th person, according to the latest official record, to summit the peak. She was part of only the tenth successful Everest expedition, later recalling: ìI felt pure joy as my thoughts registered: ëHere is the summit. I donít have to climb any more.íî

Eleven days later, the Chinese team returned to the high slopes to make another attempt. Using minimal oxygen, Pan Duo was also successful, becoming the second woman to summit Everest ó and the first to climb the harder northern side of the mountain.

Prior to these two successful expeditions, only 38 people had summited Everest ó all of them men. News of Tabeiís feat travelled fast across Asia, leading to national celebrations in Japan, Nepal and India. But it made little impact in the West.

In my own career as both a mountaineer and researcher of adventure tourism, I had been struck by how few women I encountered on the mountainside. I wanted to understand why this might be, and what women had achieved. It was through this research that I discovered Tabeiís story.

I was astonished both by her achievements ó she is also the first woman to complete the ìSeven Summits,î climbing the highest peaks on every continent ó and by how few prominent mountaineering organisations and mountaineers appeared to know about her.

Tabeiís bravery helped her lead record-setting all-women expeditions and overcome the mountain of sexism in this male-dominated space. Yet very few organisations, even in Japan, have thought to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the first ascent of Everest by a woman.Breaking the mold
Historically, men have dominated the public record in mountaineering. In the last few years, the 70th anniversary of the first summit of Everest in 1953 by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay has been marked, along with the centenary of the unsuccessful and fatal attempt by George Mallory and Andrew Irvine in 1924.

During that period, women were excluded from many mountaineering clubs. When they did join, they often faced prejudice, were discouraged and sometimes not permitted to publish records of their adventures. In 1975, women were finally admitted to the Alpine Club, the first and one of the most prestigious climbing institutions.

At a time when Japanese women were expected to remain at home, many members of the Japanese Womenís Everest Expedition, including Tabei, were working, with two of them also raising children. Tabeiís daughter, Noriko, was three at the time of her Everest summit. Tabei later revealed that the expedition encountered significant resistance: ìMost of the men in the alpine community opposed our plan, claiming it would be impossible for a women-only expedition to reach Everest.î

As a married woman and the assistant expedition leader, Tabei felt torn between motherhood and mountaineering, explaining: ìAlthough I would never forfeit Everest, I felt pulled in the two directions of mountains and motherhood.î

Facing unsympathetic attitudes from team members when childcare conflicts arose, Tabei realized she needed to put in extra effort to prove herself as a leader.

Years before the Everest expedition, Tabei and other Japanese women were already logging major climbing achievements across the globe. These included the first ascent of the north face of the Matterhorn by an all-womenís team in 1967, and the first all-womenís Japanese expedition to the Himalayas in 1970 to climb Annapurna III. Tabei was both the first woman and first Japanese person to ascend the peak.",14-May-25,World,Tabei Kikaku,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/14/travel/junko-tabei-first-woman-climb-everest,,,,,,,,,,,,may japanese women‚Äôs everest expedition team living high altitude six weeks less week away scheduled bid summit mount everest exhausted established camp five just meters south side mountain junko tabei team descended camp two meters restin early hours tons ice snow engulfed camp burying several teammates crushed snow ice tabei unable move took strength four sherpas elite nepali climbing guides assisting expedition pull suffering severe bruising tabei argued need returned base camp recover remain camp two ‚Äúthere way leaving mountain‚Äù later recalled memoir taken five years group ‚Äî first allwomen team ‚Äî get everest pressure succeed immense given limited number annual international permits climb mount everest issued nepali government gave might wait several years make another attempt meanwhile tibetan side mountain tabei‚Äôs team competition strong chinese team also working place woman summit timefrom late s tibetan women recruited participate statesponsored chinese mountaineering expeditions pan duo selected participate successful chinese everest expedition ‚Äî ordered remain meters height ‚Äúa man‚Äôs world‚Äù nonetheless pan duo ‚Äî referred ‚Äúmrs phanthog‚Äù older accounts ‚Äî celebrated country elected deputy captain chinese everest expedition unfortunately chinese team suffered climbing accident resulting death team member retreated recover ‚Äî ordered chinese government ‚Äúclimb ahead japanese women‚Äù late may allwomen japanese expedition worked together place tabei summit everest two team members ‚Äî tabei yuriko watanabe ‚Äî nominated make summit attempt however teammates suffering altitude sickness watanabe assigned help return camp two ascent tabei making arduous given injuries took great tenacity muster strength continue finally took last steps summit becoming first woman th person according latest official record summit peak part tenth successful everest expedition later recalling ‚Äúi felt pure joy thoughts registered ‚Äòhere summit don‚Äôt climb more‚Äô‚Äù eleven days later chinese team returned high slopes make another attempt using minimal oxygen pan duo also successful becoming second woman summit everest ‚Äî first climb harder northern side mountain prior two successful expeditions people summited everest ‚Äî men news tabei‚Äôs feat travelled fast across asia leading national celebrations japan nepal india made little impact west career mountaineer researcher adventure tourism struck women encountered mountainside wanted understand might women achieved research discovered tabei‚Äôs story astonished achievements ‚Äî also first woman complete ‚Äúseven summits‚Äù climbing highest peaks every continent ‚Äî prominent mountaineering organisations mountaineers appeared know tabei‚Äôs bravery helped lead recordsetting allwomen expeditions overcome mountain sexism maledominated space yet organisations even japan thought celebrate th anniversary first ascent everest womanbreaking mold historically men dominated public record mountaineering last years th anniversary first summit everest edmund hillary tenzing norgay marked along centenary unsuccessful fatal attempt george mallory andrew irvine period women excluded many mountaineering clubs join often faced prejudice discouraged sometimes permitted publish records adventures women finally admitted alpine club first one prestigious climbing institutions time japanese women expected remain home many members japanese women‚Äôs everest expedition including tabei working two also raising children tabei‚Äôs daughter noriko three time everest summit tabei later revealed expedition encountered significant resistance ‚Äúmost men alpine community opposed plan claiming impossible womenonly expedition reach everest‚Äù married woman assistant expedition leader tabei felt torn motherhood mountaineering explaining ‚Äúalthough never forfeit everest felt pulled two directions mountains motherhood‚Äù facing unsympathetic attitudes team members childcare conflicts arose tabei realized needed put extra effort prove leader years everest expedition tabei japanese women already logging major climbing achievements across globe included first ascent north face matterhorn allwomen‚Äôs team first allwomen‚Äôs japanese expedition himalayas climb annapurna iii tabei first woman first japanese person ascend peak
This extraordinary desert country has long been difficult for tourists to visit.  all changing,"ìLabËs?î (ëOK?î) asks Baba Atanof as a tourist struggles to get her leg over a large rock on a steep ascent in the Algerian Sahara Desert. Fighting jelly legs and vertigo, she can barely answer.

This desert makes up 83% of Africaís largest country. Itís the focus of a government master plan for tourism development by 2030 that aims to make Algeria a major tourist destination after decades of self-reliance post-French colonialism, which ended in 1962.
Atanof takes the womanís camera bag ó heís already carrying her small backpack. With nothing weighing her down, plus a push upwards, she becomes sure-footed again.

Meanwhile, 20 donkeys carry extensive camping gear and supplies for a dozen people without faltering. There are four tourists and eight staff, including guides, cooks and shepherds.

In worn-out sneakers, a chËche (head-and-face scarf for Touareg men) and daraa (long, loose gown), topped with his own backpack and a large solar power bank, Atanof stabilizes the tourist.

The 57-year-old father (ìbabaî in Arabic) of seven has made this challenging climb many times as a guide for 30 years. As a Touareg ó a person of Berber origin, traditionally a nomadic pastoralist, who principally lives in the Sahara Desert ó he can navigate the challenging, vast terrain.

Atanof works for Touareg Voyages, an accredited travel agency that facilitates visas for international visitors to the Algerian desert.

In January 2023, the government introduced a visa-on-arrival program for all non-exempt foreign tourists traveling to the Sahara ó essentially everyone except citizens of Mahgreb countries (five neighboring states), Malaysia and Seychelles.

That December saw the launch of an Air Algerie flight between Paris and the oasis town of Djanet.

Once challenging to obtain, visas of up to 30 days are now practically guaranteed and visitors pay the relevant fees ($38 to $376, depending on length of stay) upon arrival.

Tourism is increasing significantly as a result. In 2023, Algeria had an all-time record of nearly 3.3 million tourists, including almost 2.2 million foreigners ó a year-on-year increase of 44% and 65% respectively, according to the Algerian Ministry of Tourism and Handicrafts.

The government wants to increase the number of international visitors to 12 million by 2030, according to Reuters. Itís produced a roadmap that includes a Tourism Development Master Plan 2030 aimed at enhancing the quality of tourism services and infrastructure and significantly increasing investment and hotel capacity.

There are reportedly also plans to strengthen connections with various European capitals, particularly for visiting the desert.Atanof leads the tourists to the top of Tassili níAjjer National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site filled with giant, sandstone ìsculpturesî by Mother Nature ó ìforests of rockî eroded over seven million years.

Located near Djanet in the southeast of the country, the nearly 50,000-square-mile park is like a moonscape on a high plateau at altitudes of 4,600 to 6,600 feet.

Among these rock formations are an estimated 15,000 prehistoric paintings and engravings dating from 10,000-750 BCE. Atanof is one of the few people who knows where they are.The Algerian Ministry of Tourism and Handicrafts reckons this might be the worldís largest open-air museum ó a place where concave rock bases were ìcanvasesî for paintings made of natural pigments like red and yellow ocher.

They depict humans in everyday life and ceremonies such as hunting and dancing, as well as animals, including cattle, giraffes and camels, represented over five stylistic and chronological periods.

Those are Kel Essuf (over 9,875 years old, the oldest form of engraved anthropomorphic rock art in the area), Round Head (7,575-4,575 years ago), Bovidian (6,575-4,575 years ago, depicting cattle and herdsmen), Caballine (3,575-2,075 years ago, known for its representations of horses) and Cameline (from 750 BCE, famous for its depictions of camels).

In the abundant rock sculptures, the visitors see all kinds of objects. Atanof jumps on a rock shaped like a gymnastic vault and pretends to ride a motorcycle, beckoning someone to jump on the back.

Later he points out black fossils estimated to be a million years old on shards of red rock, and shows how colored stones can be pulverized into pigments. ìMake-up,î he jokes, streaking some on the touristsí cheeks.

The quest to see this prehistoric art involves an extraordinary adventure: a trek of about 75 miles across the craggy plateau where there is nothing but nature.

In other words, itís a week without a shower, toilet, electricity, phone reception (though the guides carry a satellite phone for emergencies), Wi-Fi, media and most 21st-century comforts.

These tourists think of it as a ìdesert spa,î they say, with daily exercise, healthy food, no alcohol, pure air, serenity and plenty of sleep. They aptly don custom T-shirts with the phrase: ìItís all about the journey.î

ìThe people who live in the desert have good health,î notes their other guide Sidi Baika, who grew up in a tent as a Touareg but now lives in a house in a desert town, working as a meteorological engineer at a global atmospheric watch station.

ìThe life of nomads is very simple and healthy ó better than the town,î he says. On this trip ìI am returning to my primitive life Ö Itís a very beautiful feeling.îWholesome meals are prepared by a professional cook with the help of a gas stovetop in a cardboard box. There are campfires and, at night, flashlights and headlamps.

Fresh breads are even baked with hot coals. Every lunch and dinner ends with three cups of tea per person: the first ìhard like life,î the second ìsweet like loveî and the third ìlight like death,î as the Touaregs say.

A dedicated tea-maker ceremoniously mixes green tea with powdered sugar, pouring it back and forth from the teapot to a metal cylinder until itís well blended and frothy (the froth makes it easy to remove any wayward sand).

ìNo tea, big problem,î says Baika, who explains that teatime is for storytelling ó part of the Touareg oral culture. ìTea is very important in the desert. News is spread from person to person over tea around a fire,î he says.

Baika shares several stories, including about ìjinnî (Arabic for ìgeniesî), invisible spirits believed to do bad or good.

The tourists move close to the fire to try to keep warm ó itís February, and winter desert temperatures drop from an average of 60 F (15.5 C) by day to freezing at night.

They pull wool blankets over themselves as he opens an offline stargazing app on his phone to show constellations in the clear starscape.


Touaregs traditionally use the stars and sun to navigate, and time to measure distance.
Based on the hours of walking, Baika estimates theyíve gotten as close as 30 miles from the Libyan border on this trip.",14-May-25,World,,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/14/travel/algeria-sahara-desert-touareg-trek-tassili-n-ajjer,,,,,,,,,,,,‚Äúlab√®s‚Äù ‚Äòok‚Äù asks baba atanof tourist struggles get leg large

Marlene Dumas painting sets new record for living female artist,"A painting by South African artist Marlene Dumas has sold for $13.6 million at auction, setting a new record for a living female artist.

ìMiss Januaryî is Dumasí ìmagnum opusî and stands 9.25 feet (2.82 meters) tall, according to a statement from auction house Christieís on Wednesday.

ìWe were thrilled with the outcome of our sale this evening,î Isabella Lauria, head of the 21st century evening sale, said in the statement, calling the price ìincredible.î

The painting had been expected to fetch between $12 million and $18 million, according to a separate statement from Christieís published earlier this month.

ìThrough its monumental scale and singular subject matter, Miss January is truly the magnum opus of Marlene Dumas,î said Sara Friedlander, deputy chairman of post-war and contemporary art at Christieís, in the May 2 statement.

ìIn this painting, Dumas triumphantly demonstrates a formal mastery of the womanís body while simultaneously freeing it from a tradition of subjection, upending normalized concepts of the female nude through the lens of a male-centric history,î she added.
Painted in 1997, the work sees Dumas revisit ìMiss World,î an artwork depicting the forms of 10 models, which she painted 30 years prior at the age of 10.

Today, Dumas is known as one of the most influential painters in the world, according to Christieís, which said she ìis known for her emotionally charged, psychologically complex portraits ó often based on found photographs ó which explore themes of sexuality, race, grief, motherhood, and the body.î

While the sale of ìMiss Januaryî sets a new record price for a work of art by a living female artist, works by male artists have traditionally sold for much more.

At Wednesdayís auction, a 1982 triple portrait by Jean-Michel Basquiat, titled ìBaby Boom,î sold for $23.4 million, and the record for the most expensive artwork by a living male artist is the $90.3 million paid for US artist Jeff Koonsí ìRabbitî sculpture in 2019.

And the gender gap in valuations is a systemic issue, according to 2022 BBC documentary ìRecalculating Art,î which found that works by female artists sell for 10% of the value of those by men.

Celebrities defy new red carpet dress code at Cannes Film Festival,"The red carpet has officially been rolled out across the Promenade de Croisette, welcoming stars to the French Riviera for the annual Cannes Film Festival. Now in its 78th year, the event is a jewel in the calendar of both lofty cinephiles and polished fashionistas. Over 12 days, actors, directors, producers, influencers and the like will descend onto the carpeted steps ó not just to promote their latest feature film at the high temple of world cinema, but also to turn a look.

This year, the fashion stakes were upped before the festival even opened its doors ó after a change in the official dress code just hours before kick-off. Nudity has been explicitly banned (presumably also prohibiting the current celebrity favorite ënakedí dress trend that has dominated the red carpet in recent years); as has ìvoluminous outfitsî with large trains for the sake of traffic control. Some, like Halle Berry, dutifully obeyed the restrictions. ìI had an amazing dress by (Gaurav) Gupta that I cannot wear tonight because itís too big of a train,î the actor said at a news conference. ìIím not going to break the rules.î Others brazenly persevered with their original wardrobe plans. Heidi Klum and Wan QianHui were the first rebels of the year, arriving in high-octane frocks with defiantly cascading trains.Elsewhere at the opening ceremony, Bella Hadid wore a slinky Saint Laurent dress, debuting honey-blonde tresses.

Remember when Salma Hayek took a chance by wearing a fuzzy cardigan to Cannes?,"Was 1999 a simpler time? With dumber phones and fuss-free styling, Y2K-era nostalgia has been strong, and its fashion is no exception. What was once a daring red-carpet look wouldnít look out of place on the streets today ó namely, the peek-a-boo cardigan Salma Hayek wore to the Cannes Film Festival that year.

The actor, who had two films premiering at Cannes ó the Gabriel Garcia M·rquez adaptation ìNo One Writes to the Colonelî and Kevin Smith-directed fantasy-comedy ìDogmaî ó paired her baby-blue short-sleeve sweater (fastened suggestively with just two buttons and a bra peeking through) with a full, flowing satin skirt in a sister shade.Hayek wore the unconventional two-piece to the amfAR Gala at Cannes, and accessorized with a silver clutch and extravagant jewelry, opting for a matching set of sapphire and diamond earrings, necklace and bracelet. Later, she traded the necklace for an elephant-shaped pendant as she danced on stage with Ben Affleck, her co-star in ìDogma.î

Voluminous satin silhouettes had a moment at the festival: Geraldine Chaplin wore an A-line maxi skirt in white with a plunging V-neck blouse and a dramatic stack of pearls around her neck, while Catherine Zeta-Jones went full prom queen with a halter-neck powder-pink gown.

"Koyo Kouoh, history-making curator of the 2026 Venice Biennale, has died, age 57","The curator Koyo Kouoh, a giant of the contemporary art world who tirelessly championed African artists and became the first woman from the continent to curate the Venice Biennale, died on Saturday, age 57.

Her death, in a hospital in Basel, Switzerland, was announced in a statement by the Biennale. While the official cause was not disclosed, her husband, Philippe Mall, said she had died of cancer following a recent diagnosis, according to The New York Times.

Kouoh had been appointed in December to curate the next edition of the Biennale, the worldís most prestigious international art exhibition. In its statement, the organization said: ìKoyo Kouoh worked with passion, intellectual rigour and vision on the conception and development of the Biennale Arte 2026. The presentation of the exhibitionís title and theme was due to take place in Venice on May 20.î

It added: ìHer passing leaves an immense void in the world of contemporary art and in the international community of artists, curators and scholars who had the privilege of knowing and admiring her extraordinary human and intellectual commitment.î

Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister, said in a statement: ìI express my deep condolences for the untimely and sudden death of Koyo Kouoh.îAsked how her death might affect the next Biennale, a spokesperson told The Art Newspaper: ìWeíll know on May 20.î The spokesperson clarified that the conference was still scheduled to take place on that date.

The Biennale is scheduled to run from May 9 to November 22, 2026. The organization had cast Kouohís appointment as reinforcing its cutting-edge reputation. In December, Pietrangelo Buttafuoco, the Biennaleís president, praised her ìrefined, young, and disruptive intelligenceî in a press statement.

In the same announcement, Kouoh called her appointment a ìonce-in-a-lifetime honor and privilege,î describing the Biennale as ìthe center of gravity for art for over a century.î She expressed hope that her exhibition would ìcarry meaning for the world we currently live in ó and most importantly, for the world we want to make.î",12-May-25,World,Mirjam Kluka,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/12/style/koyo-kouoh-death-venice-biennale-2026,,,,,,,,,,,,curator koyo kouoh giant contemporary art world tirelessly championed african artists became first woman continent curate venice biennale died saturday age death hospital basel switzerland announced statement biennale official cause disclosed husband philippe mall said died cancer following recent diagnosis according new york times kouoh appointed december curate next edition biennale world‚Äôs prestigious international art exhibition statement organization said ‚Äúkoyo kouoh worked passion intellectual rigour vision conception development biennale arte presentation exhibition‚Äôs title theme due take place venice may ‚Äù added ‚Äúher passing leaves immense void world contemporary art international community artists curators scholars privilege knowing admiring extraordinary human intellectual commitment‚Äù giorgia meloni italian prime minister said statement ‚Äúi express deep condolences untimely sudden death koyo kouoh‚Äùasked death might affect next biennale spokesperson told art newspaper ‚Äúwe‚Äôll know may ‚Äù spokesperson clarified conference still scheduled take place date biennale scheduled run may november organization cast kouoh‚Äôs appointment reinforcing cuttingedge reputation december pietrangelo buttafuoco biennale‚Äôs president praised ‚Äúrefined young disruptive intelligence‚Äù press statement announcement kouoh called appointment ‚Äúonceinalifetime honor privilege‚Äù describing biennale ‚Äúthe center gravity art century‚Äù expressed hope exhibition ‚Äúcarry meaning world currently live ‚Äî importantly world want make‚Äù
Chicago and other Midwest metros at risk for strong tornadoes as multi-day severe weather threat ramps up,"A busy stretch of severe thunderstorms is underway due to record heat and now the threats are ramping up, putting major metro areas from Chicago to Nashville under threat as the country hits the peak of tornado season.A busy stretch of severe thunderstorms is underway due to record heat and now the threats are ramping up, putting major metro areas from Chicago to Nashville under threat as the country hits the peak of tornado season.

Severe thunderstorms rocked parts of the central US on Wednesday, and Thursdayís storm threat spells trouble for tens of millions of people in the Midwest, where some areas have already been hit by damaging wind gusts, hail and tornadoes.

Itís part of what will likely be a week-long stretch of fierce weatherówith an increasing chance of a severe storm outbreak on Fridayóafter a recent lull.


Itís already been an incredibly busy year for tornadoes in the United States, but May is typically the busiest month of them all. This year is the third most active to date, only trailing the record-breaking 2011 season and last yearís hyperactive season.

Floodwaters sweep away 12-year-old boy in Virginia and force boat rescues of over 200 people from Maryland school,"Dangerous flash flooding forced search and rescue operations in multiple states Tuesday, including boat rescues at a Maryland elementary school and a search for a 12-year-old boy swept away by floodwaters in Virginia.

The boy was caught in rushing water at around 5:30 p.m. Tuesday, after a nearby creek had overtaken a roadway about 20 miles from Charlottesville, according to a 911 caller, Albemarle County Fire public information officer Logan Bogert told CN?N in a statement. The department identified the boy as Jordan Sims.

Crews found a body believed to be the missing boy at around 8:45 a.m. Wednesday, the fire department confirmed.
The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for parts of Albemarle County less than an hour before the boy was swept away. The county saw between 4 to 6 inches of rain from Monday afternoon through Tuesday night.

Gushing rainfall also forced rapid rises on nearby rivers. Water levels on the Mechums River ó located just a few miles from where the child was last seen ó rose about a foot per hour on Tuesday afternoon and ultimately topped out 5 feet above flood stage by midnight.She eventually got to a location where she was able to see her oldest son William, 10, being rescued by a boat. She waved and called out to him, but it took her a while to be reunited with both her children, including her youngest son, Quinton, 8, who was also rescued.

Her sons were among approximately 150 students and 50 adults evacuated using 15 rescue boats Tuesday as heavy rains brought flooding to the region, the countyís emergency services department said.

The children said they saw water close to the ceiling of the first floor of the school while being evacuated. By the end of the day, their pants were pulled up to their knees and their shoes were sopping wet. But they were OK.

Once they were all reunited at a local church, William was upset, and ìclingy,î not that she minded, but his younger brother, Quinton, said he had fun, reassuring her after the long ordeal.
ìHis quote was ëI had the time of my life, until the teacher wouldnít give us a snack out of the snack bin,íî she said.

Wade added that teachers at the school lost their cars in the floodwaters. Video she shared with CNN shows several vehicles floating in high waters in the parking lot.

Canada fire forecast looks bad. The impacts could spill across the border into the US,"It could be another dangerously smoky summer for some in the United States as Canada prepares for a busy wildfire season with forecasts also signaling extreme heat is in store for both countries in the coming months.

But when it comes to wildfire threats this season, the call is also coming from inside the house for the US: Violent wildfires have already raged in multiple states this year, millions were under red flag warnings this week and an active summer is on the horizon.

In Canada, wildfires have scorched tens of millions of acres, displaced hundreds of thousands of people and killed multiple firefighters since the countryís record-breaking 2023 fire season.
Some fires from the past two years also poured smoke into large population centers in Canada and the US, cratering air quality and ushering in orange-tinted, apocalyptic-looking skies.

Planet-heating fossil fuel pollution is tipping the odds that wildfire seasons like 2023 and 2024 ñ Canadaís worst season on record and its second-worst season of the century, respectively ñ wonít remain outliers for long.
Hereís what we know about this yearís Canadian wildfire forecast and how impacts could cross the border.

What Canadaís wildfire season forecast tells us
Western Canada is likely to be the epicenter for fires this season. The region is at a greater risk for destructive wildfires than provinces further east, like Ontario and Quebec, because it experiences drier and windier conditions.

Wildfires can happen at any time of the year, but May is typically the month where fire activity starts to pick up in Western Canada, according to Richard Carr, a wildfire research analyst and meteorologist with the Canadian Forest Service.ìGenerally, we start to see a few small fires pop up in March and a few in April, but things donít usually get going until we get into May or beyond,î Carr explained, but noted fires have started to crop up earlier than normal in recent years.

ìBefore we get vegetation greening up completely, itís more susceptible to burning,î Carr said.

More than 300,000 acres of land in Canada have burned as of May 13, which is much less than the 4 million acres scorched by that point last year and around the 25-year average of 280,000 acres, according to data from the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.

Western Canadaís fire season typically has a slight dip in severity in the late spring when plants have greened up, until intense summer heat arrives and dries out the ground and fuels again.
Above-average fire weather severity is forecast for almost all of Western Canada in June and July, but things could take a turn to the extreme in August, according to Natural Resources Canada. Well-above average fire weather severity is forecast for Western Canada with level 5-of-5 extreme severity projected in southern British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan where millions of people live.",14-May-25,World,Mary Gilbert,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/14/weather/canada-wildfire-smoke-forecast-climate,,,,,,,,,,,,another dangerously smoky summer united states canada prepares busy wildfire season forecasts also signaling extreme heat store countries coming months comes wildfire threats season call also coming inside house us violent wildfires already raged multiple states year millions red flag warnings week active summer horizon canada wildfires scorched tens millions acres displaced hundreds thousands people killed multiple firefighters since country‚Äôs recordbreaking fire season fires past two years also poured smoke large population centers canada us cratering air quality ushering orangetinted apocalypticlooking skies planetheating fossil fuel pollution tipping odds wildfire seasons like ‚Äì canada‚Äôs worst season record secondworst season century respectively ‚Äì won‚Äôt remain outliers long here‚Äôs know year‚Äôs canadian wildfire forecast impacts cross border canada‚Äôs wildfire season forecast tells us western canada likely epicenter fires season region greater risk destructive wildfires provinces east like ontario quebec experiences drier windier conditions wildfires can happen time year may typically month fire activity starts pick western canada according richard carr wildfire research analyst meteorologist canadian forest service‚Äúgenerally start see small fires pop march april things don‚Äôt usually get going get may beyond‚Äù carr explained noted fires started crop earlier normal recent years ‚Äúbefore get vegetation greening completely it‚Äôs susceptible burning‚Äù carr said acres land canada burned may much less million acres scorched point last year around year average acres according data canadian interagency forest fire centre western canada‚Äôs fire season typically slight dip severity late spring plants greened intense summer heat arrives dries ground fuels aboveaverage fire weather severity forecast almost western canada june july things take turn extreme august according natural resources canada wellabove average fire weather severity forecast western canada level extreme severity projected southern british columbia alberta saskatchewan millions people live
"Texas is feeling an early heat wave. It is a sign of a long, hot summer to come","A dangerous round of early season extreme heat is on tap for parts of Texas this week in a prelude to whatís expected to be an abnormally hot summer across much of the United States.

Long-standing records could fall across central and southwest Texas, including in Austin and San Antonio, as temperatures reach highs that would be unusual for mid-summer, let alone early-to-mid May.

More than 7 million people in Texas are under heat alerts from the National Weather Service Tuesday and Wednesday, with one forecast office calling this early-season heat wave ìpotentially historic.î

On Wednesday, more than 5 million people ó including in Austin and San Antonio ó will be under the weather serviceís first extreme heat warning. The new terminology, replacing the agencyís ìexcessiveî heat warning, is meant to emphasize the dangers of these temperatures.

In Austin, Wednesdayís high of 107 degrees would make it the hottest day in May on record there. Tuesdayís high of 104 degrees would be the hottest temperature on record so early in the year, and the third-earliest date to hit triple-digits there.
Temperatures in San Antonio could reach at least 103 degrees for three straight days starting Tuesday, a streak that has never been set there during May and is rare in any month.
Del Rioís high on Wednesday of 110 degrees would be the earliest it has hit 110 degrees and would tie for the 12th-hottest day on record. It would also be just 5 degrees shy of tying the cityís all-time record of 115 degrees.
Millions of people in central Texas, including the Austin metro area, will be in the National Weather Serviceís ìmajorî heat risk Wednesday. Such heat ìaffects anyone without effective cooling and/or adequate hydration,î the agency warns.Parts of southern Texas, near the Mexico border, are forecast to be at risk of ìextremeî heatóan unusually early appearance in the year for the highest risk level.

At least 31 suspected Maoist rebels killed in India biggest ever operation against decades-old insurgency," Indian police have killed 31 suspected Maoist rebels in what is being described as the ìbiggest ever operationî against the long-running insurgency.

Security forces spent 21 days attempting to capture the rebels along the border of the states of Chhattisgarh and Telangana in central India, Home Minister Amit Shah said Wednesday.

Describing the operation as a ìhistoric breakthrough,î Shah said security forces carried out the ìbiggest ever operationî against the rebels, killing 31 of them in Karreguttalu Hill, considered a Maoist stronghold.

Indian authorities have been battling Maoist rebel groups, also known as Naxals, across several central and northern states since 1967. Inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, insurgents have over the decades launched attacks on government forces in an attempt to overthrow the state and, they say, usher in a classless society.ìOur security forces completed this biggest anti-Naxal operation in just 21 days and I am extremely happy that there was not a single casualty in the security forces in this operation,î Shah wrote on X, congratulating the soldiers for their ìbravery and courage.î

ìSo far, a total of 214 Naxal hideouts and bunkers have been destroyed in this operation,î a statement from the Ministry of Home Affairs said, adding that hundreds of explosives were recovered during the search.
The insurgents are known as Naxalites in India after Naxalbari, a village in West Bengal state where they originated in the late 1960s.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the operation in a post on X.

ìThis success of the security forces shows that our campaign towards rooting out Naxalism is moving in the right direction. We are fully committed to establishing peace in the Naxal-affected areas and connecting them with the mainstream of development,î Modi said.

The Indian government has cracked down in areas where Maoist groups are active ñ an approach that, while appearing to reduce the threat level, has been criticized by some observers as heavy-handed and prone to abuse.

Incidents of violence by rebel groups fell from 1,936 in 2010 to 374 in 2024, according to data from the home ministry. The total number of civilian and security-forces deaths have also fallen by 85% during this period, the data shows.

But villagers who live in Maoist territory are largely cut off from the countryís rapidly growing economy, and many live in fear, both of rebels taking their children as recruits and violent government raids. Some villagers in Chhattisgarh previously told CNN that they were forced to pay taxes to the Maoists, or face abuse or even torture. But if they did pay up, they risked being labeled Maoist sympathizers by government forces.

At least 31 suspected Maoist rebels and two police officials were killed in February, in what was described by police as the deadliest combat this year so far.

In 2021, 22 Indian security force members were killed and 31 injured in 2021 during a four-hour gun battle with insurgents, officials said.",15-May-25,World,Rhea Mogul,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/15/india/india-maoist-rebel-group-biggest-operation-intl-hnk,,,,,,,,,,,,indian police killed suspected maoist rebels described ‚Äúbiggest ever operation‚Äù longrunning insurgency security forces spent days attempting capture rebels along border states chhattisgarh telangana central india home minister amit shah said wednesday describing operation ‚Äúhistoric breakthrough‚Äù shah said security forces carried ‚Äúbiggest ever operation‚Äù rebels killing karreguttalu hill considered maoist stronghold indian authorities battling maoist rebel groups also known naxals across several central northern states since inspired chinese revolutionary leader mao zedong insurgents decades launched attacks government forces attempt overthrow state say usher classless society‚Äúour security forces completed biggest antinaxal operation just days extremely happy single casualty security forces operation‚Äù shah wrote x congratulating soldiers ‚Äúbravery courage‚Äù ‚Äúso far total naxal hideouts bunkers destroyed operation‚Äù statement ministry home affairs said adding hundreds explosives recovered search insurgents known naxalites india naxalbari village west bengal state originated late s prime minister narendra modi hailed operation post x ‚Äúthis success security forces shows campaign towards rooting naxalism moving right direction fully committed establishing peace naxalaffected areas connecting mainstream development‚Äù modi said indian government cracked areas maoist groups active ‚Äì approach appearing reduce threat level criticized observers heavyhanded prone abuse incidents violence rebel groups fell according data home ministry total number civilian securityforces deaths also fallen period data shows villagers live maoist territory largely cut country‚Äôs rapidly growing economy many live fear rebels taking children recruits violent government raids villagers chhattisgarh previously told cnn forced pay taxes maoists face abuse even torture pay risked labeled maoist sympathizers government forces least suspected maoist rebels two police officials killed february described police deadliest combat year far indian security force members killed injured fourhour gun battle insurgents officials said
"More than 1,000 US kids were named King last year. But in New Zealand, that name is banned"," It seems some parents in New Zealand just canít get the message. Once again, King has topped the list of baby names rejected by the countryís Registrar General.

The royal title led the list of banned baby names for 14 years in a row until 2023 when it was replaced by Prince, which ranks second in the latest iteration.

Other regal references including Duke, Majesty and Emperor are also a no-go in the country, which polices birth names under its strict registration law.

New Zealand registered 60,000 births last year and rejected 38 proposed names, according to a letter from John Crawford-Smith, Principal Advisor of the Department of Internal Affairs, in response to a written inquiry.

Under the law, baby names must not be offensive, unreasonably long, or include numbers and symbols. They must also refrain from resembling official titles and ranks ìwithout adequate justification,î according to the Births, Deaths, Marriages, and Relationships Registration Act 2021.

New Zealand is part of the British Commonwealth and a constitutional monarchy that calls Charles III its King. Itís not known if the 11 parents who applied to call their child King meant it as an ode to Charles, but all were asked to have a rethink, according to Crawford-Smith.In 2024, more than 1,000 children in the United States were called King, according to the Social Security Administration. (Liam and Olivia were the top US names last year).

Most of New Zealandís rejected names had royal links. Ten applications for Prince were rejected, followed by four for Princess. Names like Kingi, Kingz, Prinz, Prynce, and Royallty were also banned ñ potentially because department staff also consider how names sound when spoken when deciding if theyíll be approved.

Officials also consider community perceptions of the proposed name. That may be why other names, including Sativa and Indica, both strains of cannabis, were rejected.

Fanny, once a popular first name, was also declined.

Parents are given an opportunity to explain their rationale before the Registrar General makes a final decision. ìWe continue to urge parents to think carefully about names,î Crawford-Smith wrote in the letter. ìNames are a gift,î he added.

New Zealand is not the only country that imposes laws to regulate newbornsí names.

In 2015, a French judge in the northern part of the country refused to let two parents name their child Nutella because of the risk of humiliation.

Sweden also has a naming law and has nixed attempts to name children ìSuperman,î ìMetallica,î and ìBrfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116.î

In the United States, some naming fights have centered on adults.

In 2008, a judge allowed an Illinois school bus driver to legally change his first name to ìIn Godî and his last name to ìWe Trust.î

Former Olympic cyclist Rohan Dennis receives suspended sentence over wife's death,"Former Olympic cyclist and world champion Rohan Dennis received a suspended sentence on Wednesday over what was termed a ìtragic accidentî that led to the death of his wife, fellow Olympian Melissa Hoskins.

The 34-year-old Dennis appeared in South Australia District Court after earlier pleading guilty to a charge of committing an aggravated act likely to cause harm.

Dennis was arrested after Hoskins, 32, was struck by his vehicle in front of their home at Medindie in Adelaideís north on Dec. 30, 2023. Hoskins suffered serious injuries in the crash and died at Royal Adelaide Hospital.


The court was told that the couple had argued over kitchen renovations before Dennis left their home and drove away. The court also heard that Hoskins had jumped onto the hood of the car during the incident. His licence was also suspended for five years.

Dennis on Wednesday was sentenced to one year, four months and 28 days in jail, to be suspended for two years. The sentence was reduced from two years and two months because of his guilty plea and heís been placed on a two-year good behavior bond.The offense carried a maximum sentence of seven years in jail but lawyer Jane Abbey asked that her client receive a suspended sentence, which was not opposed by the prosecution.

During sentencing submissions in in April, Amanda Hoskins said her daughter had loved Dennis ìand I know that you would never intentionally hurt her.î

ìI believe this is a tragic accident. Your temper is your downfall and needs to be addressed,î she said.

Hoskinsí funeral was held in her home city of Perth, Western Australia and a public memorial service was held in Adelaide in February 2024. Dennis attended the service with their two children.

Hoskins competed at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics on the track in the team pursuit and was in the squad that won the 2015 world title. Dennis won two world titles in the road time trial, as well as silver in the team pursuit at the 2012 Olympics and bronze in the road time trial at the Tokyo Olympics.",13-May-25,World,Maja Smiejkowska,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/13/australia/australia-rohan-dennis-sentenced-melissa-hoskins-hnk-intl,,,,,,,,,,,,former olympic cyclist world champion rohan dennis received suspended sentence wednesday termed ‚Äútragic accident‚Äù led death wife fellow olympian melissa hoskins yearold dennis appeared south australia district court earlier pleading guilty charge committing aggravated act likely cause harm dennis arrested hoskins struck vehicle front home medindie adelaide‚Äôs north dec hoskins suffered serious injuries crash died royal adelaide hospital court told couple argued kitchen renovations dennis left home drove away court also heard hoskins jumped onto hood car incident licence also suspended five years dennis wednesday sentenced one year four months days jail suspended two years sentence reduced two years two months guilty plea he‚Äôs placed twoyear good behavior bondthe offense carried maximum sentence seven years jail lawyer jane abbey asked client receive suspended sentence opposed prosecution sentencing submissions april amanda hoskins said daughter loved dennis ‚Äúand know never intentionally hurt her‚Äù ‚Äúi believe tragic accident temper downfall needs addressed‚Äù said hoskins‚Äô funeral held home city perth western australia public memorial service held adelaide february dennis attended service two children hoskins competed olympics track team pursuit squad won world title dennis won two world titles road time trial well silver team pursuit olympics bronze road time trial tokyo olympics

"Relatives of El Chapo enter US as part of negotiation,Mexico's security secretary says","Several family members of Mexican drug trafficker JoaquÌn ìEl Chapoî Guzm·n have entered the United States as part of negotiations in a case against one of his sons, Mexicoís Security Secretary Omar GarcÌa Harfuch told the Mexican network Radio FÛrmula on Tuesday.

El Chapoís son Ovidio Guzm·n LÛpez is facing drug trafficking charges in the US over his alleged role in the Sinaloa Cartel, which his father co-founded. Ovidio was extradited to the US in September 2023, several months after Mexican authorities arrested him in a large-scale operation that resulted in at least 29 deaths.

Days after his extradition, he pleaded not guilty to the drug trafficking charges in a US court. But last week, he reached an agreement to change his plea, according to a court document reviewed by CNN. The document did not specify details of the agreement.

ìItís clear that with his family going to the United States, itís connected to this negotiation or plea deal opportunity provided by the (US) Department of Justice itself,î GarcÌa Harfuch told Radio FÛrmula.

Several Mexican media outlets reported Tuesday that 17 of Ovidioís relatives had crossed the border into the United States. CNN has requested more information from the Mexican Ministry of Security and Citizen Protection, as well as the US Department of Justice.

GarcÌa Harfuch added that the relatives who left the country were not wanted by Mexican authorities.Ovidio is one of four sons of El Chapo who have been charged in the US with various crimes over their alleged roles in the Sinaloa Cartel.

Collectively known as ìLos Chapitos,î the brothers are thought to have been brought into the cartel as teenagers to learn the ins and outs of the organization, according to the think tank InSight Crime. Their roles became more prominent around the mid-2010s, roughly when their father was captured and extradited to the United States.

Another son of El Chapo, JoaquÌn Guzm·n LÛpez, is also in US custody. He was arrested in July 2024 when he flew into the United States on a private plane from Mexico alongside Ismael ìEl Mayoî Zambada, a co-founder of the cartel who the brothers had been at odds with.

JoaquÌn had allegedly organized his arrest and that of El Mayo by luring him on the flight to examine a piece of land he thought was in Mexico, an official familiar with the operation had told CNN at the time. Instead, the plane landed in El Paso, Texas, where federal agents arrested them.Mexico Secretary of Security Rosa Icela Rodriguez said in August that JoaquÌn had reached an agreement with his brother Ovidio ìso that they would go to the United States to surrender.î

However, an attorney for Ovidio told CNN that Rodriguezís claim was ìa complete and utter fabrication.î An attorney for El Mayo said he ìneither surrendered nor negotiated any terms with the US governmentî and described the flight to the US as a violent kidnapping.

Two other sons of El Chapo, Ivan Archivaldo and Jesus Alfredo Guzm·n Salazar, are still at large. The US has accused them of leading large-scale drug trafficking operations for the cartel and has issued $10 million bounties for information leading to each of their arrests.

Mexican forces had previously arrested Ovidio in a 2019 operation that ended in failure. Shortly after he was detained in October of that year, the cartel quickly mobilized dozens of gunmen to battle Mexican authorities and try to free him.

Ovidio was eventually released on the orders of then-President AndrÈs Manuel LÛpez Obrador to stop the violence. He then went into hiding until his second arrest and eventual extradition in 2023.",13-May-25,World,VerÛnica CalderÛn and Michael Rios,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/13/americas/relatives-el-chapo-enter-us-intl-latam,,,,,,,,,,,,several family members mexican drug trafficker joaqu√≠n ‚Äúel chapo‚Äù guzm√°n entered united states part negotiations case one sons mexico‚Äôs security secretary omar garc√≠a harfuch told mexican network radio f√≥rmula tuesday el chapo‚Äôs son ovidio guzm√°n l√≥pez facing drug trafficking charges us alleged role sinaloa cartel father cofounded ovidio extradited us september several months mexican authorities arrested largescale operation resulted least deaths days extradition pleaded guilty drug trafficking charges us court last week reached agreement change plea according court document reviewed cnn document specify details agreement ‚Äúit‚Äôs clear family going united states it‚Äôs connected negotiation plea deal opportunity provided us department justice itself‚Äù garc√≠a harfuch told radio f√≥rmula several mexican media outlets reported tuesday ovidio‚Äôs relatives crossed border united states cnn requested information mexican ministry security citizen protection well us department justice garc√≠a harfuch added relatives left country wanted mexican authoritiesovidio one four sons el chapo charged us various crimes alleged roles sinaloa cartel collectively known ‚Äúlos chapitos‚Äù brothers thought brought cartel teenagers learn ins outs organization according think tank insight crime roles became prominent around mids roughly father captured extradited united states another son el chapo joaqu√≠n guzm√°n l√≥pez also us custody arrested july flew united states private plane mexico alongside ismael ‚Äúel mayo‚Äù zambada cofounder cartel brothers odds joaqu√≠n allegedly organized arrest el mayo luring flight examine piece land thought mexico official familiar operation told cnn time instead plane landed el paso texas federal agents arrested themmexico secretary security rosa icela rodriguez said august joaqu√≠n reached agreement brother ovidio ‚Äúso go united states surrender‚Äù however attorney ovidio told cnn rodriguez‚Äôs claim ‚Äúa complete utter fabrication‚Äù attorney el mayo said ‚Äúneither surrendered negotiated terms us government‚Äù described flight us violent kidnapping two sons el chapo ivan archivaldo jesus alfredo guzm√°n salazar still large us accused leading largescale drug trafficking operations cartel issued million bounties information leading arrests mexican forces previously arrested ovidio operation ended failure shortly detained october year cartel quickly mobilized dozens gunmen battle mexican authorities try free ovidio eventually released orders thenpresident andr√©s manuel l√≥pez obrador stop violence went hiding second arrest eventual extradition

Condo owners sue over New York skyscraper they say is riddled with thousands of severe cracks,"Apartment owners at a luxury New York skyscraper are suing the buildingís developers over a ìfar-reaching fraudî in which they allegedly hid structurally significant defects ó including ìthousandsî of severe cracks on the towerís facade.

The condo board at 432 Park Avenue, a super-skinny high-rise on Manhattanís Billionaireís Row, claims that real estate firm CIM Group failed to disclose the extent of damage that has resulted in flooding and impacted the value of their multimillion-dollar properties.

Filed at the state court in New York in late April, the lawsuit also names architecture and engineering companies involved in the project. Condo owners are collectively seeking more than $165 million in damages, according to the complaint.Completed in 2015, the slender 1,396-foot-tall skyscraper has a 15:1 height-to-width ratio, putting it among the so-called ìpencil towersî now dotting midtown Manhattanís skyline. To protect against high winds, the building was designed with unoccupied floors that encourage airflow, anchors drilled deep into the bedrock and ìtuned mass dampersî that act like pendulums to counteract swaying.

Property developer Harry Macklowe ó whose firm McGraw Hudson Construction Corp is also named in the suit ó compared the tower to the Empire State Building, telling the New York Times in 2013 that it was ìthe building of the 21st century.î Pop star Jennifer Lopez and Chinese businessman Ye Jianming are among those reported to have purchased units there for eight-figure sums.

But owners and residents have since complained of numerous construction issues, including more than 20 water leaks since 2017, according to the complaint. In 2021, the condo board filed a lawsuit alleging a range of defects, from malfunctioning elevators and poor energy efficiency to a trash chute that sounds ìlike a bombî when used.The new lawsuit meanwhile claims that the towerís facade is ìplagued with thousands of severe cracks, spalling, and other forms of deterioration,î including a 10-inch-deep crack in the buildingís core. As well as causing flooding, the damage has corroded some of the steel in the towerís reinforced concrete columns, the complaint alleges.

While the 2021 complaint also detailed ìsubstantial cracking,î the condo board said it filed its most recent action after claiming it uncovered evidence that defendants had ìconspiredî to conceal the extent and seriousness of the defects.

In statements provided to CNN, both CIM Group and SLCE Architects, the projectís architect of record, said they ìvehementlyî deny the claims and are moving to have the complaint dismissed. Engineering firm WSP declined to comment.

Shortlisted designs for Queen Elizabe's official London memorial unveiled,"A pair of gently curved bridges, a bronze oak tree and a lily pad-inspired walkway are among the standout features of five shortlisted designs for Queen Elizabeth IIís official memorial site in central London.

The national memorial will be built in St. Jamesís Park, near Buckingham Palace in the heart of the British capital.

The finalists, unveiled Wednesday, include some of the UKís most prominent architecture firms, including Foster + Partners, which designed Londonís City Hall and 30 St. Mary Axe (known as The Gherkin), and Heatherwick Studios, the firm behind New York Cityís Vessel structure.

A panel from The Queen Elizabeth Memorial Committee, which was jointly established by the British government and Royal Household, will announce a winning proposal this summer, according to a press release. The memorial is expected to be unveiled in 2026, marking what would have been the late Queenís centenary.The design brief asked for ìan emotionally powerful placeî that celebrates Elizabeth IIís ìextraordinary life of service,î while providing the public with a space for reflection.

ìShe was part of our national identity and helped to define our values, she gave us a?sense of continuity through times of great change, she was integral to recognizing achievement and she exemplified service and duty, strengthened by faith and leavened by pragmatism, optimism and humor,î said committee chair Lord Janvrin, the late Queenís former private secretary, in the press release.ìThe masterplan design needs to seek inspiration from all this,î he added. ìThe memorial must be ó simply ó a?beautiful place, a?place to visit with friends, a?place to gather, to enjoy, and to reflect on an extraordinary?life.î

Why the Chrysler Building is an Art Deco icon,"Though it only had the distinction of being the worldís tallest building for 11 months, the Chrysler Building in midtown Manhattan has remained one of the most recognizable skyscrapers in the world ó and a glimmering architectural icon of the Art Deco period, which celebrates its centennial on April 28.

The 1920s and 1930s gave rise to buildings such as Chicagoís Tribune Tower and New Yorkís Waldorf Astoria hotel that mixed materials and colors through the use of steel, glass, terracotta, stone and marble. This new modern style prized vertical designs that drew the eye upwards, decorative glass and metalwork with geometric and floral motifs, high-shine lacquered surfaces, and unique sculptural adornments ó overall, a movement toward originality instead of references to the past.

ìUntil the 1920s, American architects tended to design their buildings with one eye looking over their left shoulder of Europe,î said Anthony W. Robins, a founding member and former vice president of The Art Deco Society of New York, in a phone call. Architectural styles in the US often followed revivals popular across the West, he noted, such as the Greek, Romanesque and Italian Renaissance revivals that fell in and out of favor.

But Art Deco didnít have a name for decades; in 1966, during renewed interest in the era, a group of curators named the style after the ìExposition Internationale des Arts DÈcoratifs et Industriels Modernes,î which took place on April 28, 1925 in Paris and drew some 16 million visitors over seven months, forging a new period of architecture, design and decorative arts that influenced many parts of the world.
The 1,046-foot-tall Chrysler Building, completed in May of 1930, was the pinnacle of both the then-unnamed Art Deco period and the skyscraper boom that rapidly transformed New York Cityís skyline. It dethroned the Eiffel Tower as the worldís tallest structure, and was only eclipsed by the Empire State Building before such lofty projects came to a halt as the global economy cratered during the Great Depression, Robins noted.

ì(The Chrysler Building) and the Empire State Building were the culmination of this huge skyscraper race,î he said. ìThey werenít the last to open up before the Depression put an end to it, but they were Ö the two that took the title of the ëworldís tallest building.íî

Higher and higher
Designed by the architect William van Alen for the automotive magnate Walter P. Chrysler, who took over the project from the developer and politician William H. Reynolds, the tower features a steel frame and white and gray bricks that ascend skyward with three vertical columns of windows on each side, flanked by horizontal rows that appear like notches at each level. Climaxing with a cascade of curvilinear sunbursts at its peak, it tapers off to a gleaming 185-foot-tall spire ó one that had to be secretly assembled and erected from the inside to deliver on its promise to become the worldís new tallest building.During construction, the Chryslerís superlative was at risk by a structure rising in tandem at 40 Wall Street. Though the New York Times reported in October 1929 that Paul Starrett, the downtown buildingís developer, denied competing for ìheight supremacy,î the building plans had changed to accommodate additional floors. The press played up the rivalry over the course of a year, Robins noted, until Van Alen resolved it by having the spire covertly assembled from five parts on the 65th floor and quickly hoisted up in 90 minutes so that competitors would not know its final height until it was completed.With the Empire State Building on the horizon, as well as plans for other supertalls that were never built ó including the Noyes Building, a monumental, four-block wide, 1,600-foot-tall terracotta tower that, in New Yorkís skyline, would have only fallen short of One World Trade Center today ó the Chrysler Building was the symbol of a rapidly changing skyline.",28-Apr-25,World,Jacqui Palumbo,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/28/style/chrysler-building-art-deco-centennial,,,,,,,,,,,,though distinction world‚Äôs tallest building months chrysler building midtown manhattan remained one recognizable skyscrapers world ‚Äî glimmering architectural icon art deco period celebrates centennial april s s gave rise buildings chicago‚Äôs tribune tower new york‚Äôs waldorf astoria hotel mixed materials colors use steel glass terracotta stone marble new modern style prized vertical designs drew eye upwards decorative glass metalwork geometric floral motifs highshine lacquered surfaces unique sculptural adornments ‚Äî overall movement toward originality instead references past ‚Äúuntil s american architects tended design buildings one eye looking left shoulder europe‚Äù said anthony w robins founding member former vice president art deco society new york phone call architectural styles us often followed revivals popular across west noted greek romanesque italian renaissance revivals fell favor art deco didn‚Äôt name decades renewed interest era group curators named style ‚Äúexposition internationale des arts d√©coratifs et industriels modernes‚Äù took place april paris drew million visitors seven months forging new period architecture design decorative arts influenced many parts world foottall chrysler building completed may pinnacle thenunnamed art deco period skyscraper boom rapidly transformed new york city‚Äôs skyline dethroned eiffel tower world‚Äôs tallest structure eclipsed empire state building lofty projects came halt global economy cratered great depression robins noted ‚Äúthe chrysler building empire state building culmination huge skyscraper race‚Äù said ‚Äúthey weren‚Äôt last open depression put end ‚Ä¶ two took title ‚Äòworld‚Äôs tallest building‚Äô‚Äù higher higher designed architect william van alen automotive magnate walter p chrysler took project developer politician william h reynolds tower features steel frame white gray bricks ascend skyward three vertical columns windows side flanked horizontal rows appear like notches level climaxing cascade curvilinear sunbursts peak tapers gleaming foottall spire ‚Äî one secretly assembled erected inside deliver promise become world‚Äôs new tallest buildingduring construction chrysler‚Äôs superlative risk structure rising tandem wall street though new york times reported october paul starrett downtown building‚Äôs developer denied competing ‚Äúheight supremacy‚Äù building plans changed accommodate additional floors press played rivalry course year robins noted van alen resolved spire covertly assembled five parts th floor quickly hoisted minutes competitors know final height completedwith empire state building horizon well plans supertalls never built ‚Äî including noyes building monumental fourblock wide foottall terracotta tower new york‚Äôs skyline fallen short one world trade center today ‚Äî chrysler building symbol rapidly changing skyline
Construction of world's tallest abandoned skyscraper to resume after a decade,"Construction of the worldís tallest unoccupied skyscraper may resume as early as next week, almost 10 years after work ground to a halt, according to Chinese state media.

The 597-meter-tall (1,959-foot) Goldin Finance 117, which topped out in the northern Chinese port city of Tianjin but has stood unfinished since 2015 amid major financial difficulties, is now expected to complete in 2027.

At 117 stories high, the tower was set to be Chinaís tallest skyscraper when it broke ground in 2008. The soaring structure was built using ìmega columnsî to protect against strong winds and earthquakes, while its ìwalking stickî design was topped by a diamond-shaped atrium containing a swimming pool and observation deck. It was set to contain offices and a five-star hotel on the upper floors, according to architects P&T Group.

But the project came to a standstill following the 2015 Chinese stock market crash that plunged the future of Hong Kong-based Goldin Properties Holdings into doubt. The real estate developer, whose founder Pan Sutong was once among Hong Kongís richest businessmen, has since gone into liquidation.A new construction permit ó which reportedly lists a contract value of almost 569 million yuan ($78 million) ó suggests the defunct developerís title may have been dropped from the buildingís name, according to state media. It is unclear whether plans for the ìsupertallî skyscraperís use remain unchanged. Neither P&T Group nor BGI Engineering Consultants, the state-owned company named on the permit, responded to CNNís requests for comment.

Over the last decade, the abandoned skyscrapers littering Chinaís skylines have become emblematic of the countryís real estate woes. In 2020, its housing ministry and National Development and Reform Commission issued guidelines banning new towers over 500 meters (1,640 feet) in height ó a move seemingly aimed, in part, at reining in the speculative financing often underpinning skyscraper projects.On Monday, Chinaís Greenland Group announced that work is also resuming on the previously stalled Chengdu Greenland Tower in the southwestern city of Chengdu, local state-owned media reported. Construction of the 468-meter-tall (1,535-foot) skyscraper has been on hold since 2023, after the state-owned developer encountered financial difficulties, according to Reuters.

The fact that two high-profile projects are resuming at the same time is unlikely to be a coincidence, said Qiao Shitong, a law professor at Duke University School of Law and the author of two books on Chinese real estate.

Vatican puts Sagrada FamÌlia architect on the path to sainthood,"Antoni GaudÌ, the celebrated Catalan long nicknamed ìGodís architectî for designing Barcelonaís Sagrada FamÌlia, has been put on the path to sainthood by the Vatican.

In a statement released on Monday, the Vatican said Pope Francis recognized GaudÌís ìheroic virtues,î which is a step on the path to sainthood.

Becoming a saint is a complex process that can take hundreds of years, however, since a candidate normally needs two miracles to be attributed to their intercession.

Finding those miracles will be the next step if GaudÌ is to beatified and then canonized. Commissions of doctors and theologians then examine the miracles before the pope makes the ultimate decision to canonize someone.

GaudÌ is a rare case. Few artists become saints and no architect, in the modern understanding of the profession, has ever been canonized.GaudÌís legacy is intrinsically linked with Catholicism as he dedicated much of his career to the Sagrada FamÌlia ñ a church of such awesome splendor that it remains unfinished more than 140 years after construction began.

He envisioned the church to be ìa Bible in stoneî and designed a monumental structure with 18 huge, spindle-shaped towers, each symbolizing a different biblical figure ñ the 12 apostles, the four evangelists, the Virgin Mary and Jesus.

When it is finally completed in 2026, the tower of Jesus Christ will stand at 172.5 meters (566 feet) tall and will be finished with a 17-meter-tall (56-foot) four-armed cross, making it the worldís tallest church.

Inside, the nave is bathed in multicolored light that streams in from every direction through ornately decorated stained-glass windows.GaudÌ never saw the church anywhere near completion. He died in 1926, when only an estimated 10%-15% of the project had been built, including one transept, a crypt and some of the apse wall.

Although GaudÌ dedicated the remaining few years of his life and career exclusively to the Sagrada FamÌlia, other buildings bearing his distinctive style are dotted all over Barcelona, lending the city much of its character.

For decades, there has been a movement calling for GaudÌís beatification, known as the Association for the Beatification of Antoni GaudÌ. The Archbishop of Barcelona took up that cause in 2023 and submitted the positio, or key argument, for GaudÌís beatification to the Vatican.","April 15 ,2025",World,"Issy Ronald, Christopher Lamb",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/15/style/vatican-gaudi-saint-sagrada-familia-intl-scli,,,,,,,,,,,,antoni gaud√≠ celebrated catalan long nicknamed ‚Äúgod‚Äôs architect‚Äù designing barcelona‚Äôs sagrada fam√≠lia put path sainthood vatican statement released monday vatican said pope francis recognized gaud√≠‚Äôs ‚Äúheroic virtues‚Äù step path sainthood becoming saint complex process can take hundreds years however since candidate normally needs two miracles attributed intercession finding miracles next step gaud√≠ beatified canonized commissions doctors theologians examine miracles pope makes ultimate decision canonize someone gaud√≠ rare case artists become saints architect modern understanding profession ever canonizedgaud√≠‚Äôs legacy intrinsically linked catholicism dedicated much career sagrada fam√≠lia ‚Äì church awesome splendor remains unfinished years construction began envisioned church ‚Äúa bible stone‚Äù designed monumental structure huge spindleshaped towers symbolizing different biblical figure ‚Äì apostles four evangelists virgin mary jesus finally completed tower jesus christ stand meters feet tall finished metertall foot fourarmed cross making world‚Äôs tallest church inside nave bathed multicolored light streams every direction ornately decorated stainedglass windowsgaud√≠ never saw church anywhere near completion died estimated project built including one transept crypt apse wall although gaud√≠ dedicated remaining years life career exclusively sagrada fam√≠lia buildings bearing distinctive style dotted barcelona lending city much character decades movement calling gaud√≠‚Äôs beatification known association beatification antoni gaud√≠ archbishop barcelona took cause submitted positio key argument gaud√≠‚Äôs beatification vatican
Indianapolis Colts apologize for since-deleted schedule release video that poked fun at Tyreek Hill's run-in with police,"The Indianapolis Colts publicly apologized to Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill for poking fun at his detainment before the first game of the 2024 season in a since-deleted video unveiling the teamís schedule for this season.

The Colts posted the video Wednesday as part of the NFLís schedule release. Itís become popular for teams to make creative videos unveiling schedules in recent years and the Coltsí video played off the video game Minecraft. A film based on the game, ìA Minecraft Movie,î was released earlier this year and has been a smash hit at the box office. The movie was distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, which, like CNN, is part of Warner Bros. Discovery.

In the opening scene of the video posted by the Colts, a dolphin wearing a No. 10 jersey and labeled ìHillî is approached by a Coast Guard boat that has a siren blaring and a police officer on board.

ìWe removed our schedule release video because it exceeded our rights with Microsoft and included an insensitive clip involving Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill. We sincerely apologize to Microsoft and Tyreek,î the Colts said in a statement to CNN Sports.

Hill responded to the video on Thursday: ìShouldíve left it up @Colts , this was funny.î

The incident involving Hill happened just before the Dolphinsí first game of the season last year when the wide receiver was driving to the stadium and was stopped by police.

Video of the traffic stop showed officers pulling Hill out of his car, handcuffing him and placing him face down in the road after he did not immediately comply with their commands. Hill told CNN? afterward that he wasnít moving quickly because he was still recovering from a minor knee surgery that took place before the 2024 season.

ìI was shocked. It was crazy because it all happened so fast. Like for me, it just all happened so fast and I really couldnít like gather everything that was happening,î Hill told Kaitlan Collins on ìThe Sourceî at the time.

ìI wasnít moving fast because you know I got injuries, I got things that I go through. I play a physical sport, Iíve been doing this for a moment now man so Iím dealing with some stuff, so I guess the officers they felt like I wasnít doing it on their timing,î he added.The South Florida Police Benevolent Association defended the actions of the officers involved, highlighting that Hill was never placed under arrest. The association said Hill was not cooperative and that officers were working in the interest of their own safety.

Other Miami Dolphins players, who had pulled over to offer assistance to Hill, were also treated aggressively. Calais Campbell, a former Walter Payton Man of the Year award winner, told reporters he was placed in handcuffs by police after he approached the scene and tried to talk with officers about what as taking place. Bystanders and police body-worn cameras captured the September 8 incident.

Hill was issued two citations stemming from the stop outside Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. He had previously pleaded not guilty to careless driving and not wearing a seatbelt.

A judge dismissed the citations in November after the officer involved in the stop didnít show up in court.

The curious case of the missing Wanamaker Trophy," The famed Wanamaker Trophy is the largest and heaviest in golf, but donít think for one minute it canít ever be lost.

A star-studded field is converging on North Carolina this week for the PGA Championship at Quail Hollow to battle it out for the coveted title, but it wonít be the original glittering piece of silverware theyíre competing for.

At 28 inches tall, 10.5 inches in diameter and weighing 27 pounds, the Wanamaker dates back to 1916, the year the PGA of America was founded.Walter Hagen is one of the sportís all-time greats. A superstar of his era. Heís third on the all-time list of major winners with 11 behind only Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods.

Hagen won the PGA Championship a total of five times ñ the same record tally as Nicklaus ñ with four of those titles coming consecutively between 1924 and 1927, but itís what happened after his 1925 triumph ñ exactly 100 years ago ñ that led to him facing a rather uncomfortable truth over many years.

After his victory at the Olympia Fields Country Club near Chicago, Hagen would later reveal he lost the hefty yet highly prestigious trophy while out celebrating after purportedly giving it to a taxi driver to take back to his hotel; the trophy never made it to its destination.Now, just imagine having to win a major golf tournament to keep a terrible secret safe ñ and then to keep winning it. That was Hagenís new reality.
A year later, Hagen showed up to defend his title at the 1926 tournament without the Wanamaker Trophy. Such was the Americanís dominance in this era, nobody had seriously questioned where the trophy actually was, but after a third-straight win, the question was indeed finally asked. The champ though was unfazed. He brushed it off, saying he had no intention of relinquishing his title. ìI will win it anyway, so I didnít bring it,î he added.

True to his word, he won again a year later, but all good things eventually come to an end and his incredible win streak would finally be over at the 1928 tournament following defeat to his compatriot Leo Diegel. At that point, Hagen knew the game was up and he had to come clean.

Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian buys minority stake in Chelsea women's team,"Entrepreneur and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian has continued his investment into womenís sport by purchasing a minority stake in English soccer club Chelsea FC Women.

The 42-year-old, who will now sit on the board, announced the deal on Thursday, saying he was ìproudî to help this ìiconic clubî to become the most popular Womenís Super League (WSL) team in the US.

Chelsea is already one of the most successful teams in womenís soccer and recently secured its sixth consecutive league title ñ without losing a single game.

The team is now on the hunt for a domestic treble which it can complete when it faces Manchester United in the Womenís FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium on Sunday.

ìThese players are rewriting the game. Undefeated season. Eyes on the treble. But this isnít just about winning titles. Itís about finally matching their talent with the resources, visibility, and respect they deserve,î Ohanian, who is married to tennis legend Serena Williams, said on Instagram.

ìIíve been right about this before and I couldnít be more excited.îBritish media reported on Wednesday that Ohanian had purchased a 10% share of the club worth more than $26 million. It was a figure he appeared to confirm by screenshotting a photo of an article which referenced that figure.

Chelsea confirmed the new investment in a statement on Thursday, saying that Ohanian brought with him ìa wealth of experience, energy and passion for womenís sports that will help take Chelsea Women to the next level and shine a light on the potential of the sport here in the UK.î

The club did not confirm details around the deal, but CNN Sports has reached out to the club for comment.

In his statement on social media, Ohanian also praised Chelsea Womenís new CEO Aki Mandhar.

ìHer integrity and focus on a standard of excellence were a huge factor in why this was such a ëHell Yesí-type investment,î he added.

More investment
Itís not the first time that Ohanian has invested in womenís soccer.

In 2022, he was the founding investor of Angel City FC, a Los Angeles-based team that now plays in the National Womenís Soccer League (NWSL) ñ the top division of womenís soccer in the US.

The club then became the most valuable womenís professional sports team in the world after a huge takeover agreement in 2024.

Ohanian also founded Athlos, a womenís-only track and field event that debuted last year. The event offers $60,000 for race winners and aims to champion female athletes across the world.

Minnesota Timberwolves eliminate Steph Curry-less Golden State Warriors to reach Western Conference Finals,"ota Timberwolves reached their second straight Western Conference Finals. Abbie Parr/AP
CNN
 ó 
The Minnesota Timberwolves reached their second straight Western Conference Finals as they downed the Golden State Warriors 121-110 to close out a 4-1 series win.

The Warriors were again without injured star guard Steph Curry, who hasnít played since suffering a hamstring strain in the second quarter of Game 1.However, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr didnít use Curryís absence as an excuse for his teamís postseason exit, insisting that ìinjuries are a part of the playoffs.î

ìThereís no sense in dwelling on it,î he added. ìI donít want to take anything away from what Minnesota just accomplished. No sense in even talking about Steph.î

Julius Randle ñ who is quickly earning the moniker ëPlayoff Juliusí on social media ñ led the Timberwolves with 29 points on 13-of-18 shooting to go with eight rebounds and five assists.

Randle joined the Timberwolves ahead of the season in a big trade that sent Karl-Anthony Towns to the New York Knicks and endured his share of teething pains during his first season in Minnesota.But the three-time All Star is averaging almost 24 points per game in the playoffs and has scored at least 20 points in eight of the Timberwolvesí 10 postseason games so far.
ìJust how he creates for others and his impact on the game,î Minnesota star guard Anthony Edwards said when asked what stood out about Randleís performances.

ìThe way he controls the tempo, the way he pushes the pace, the way he brings us along with him when he pushes the pace and even his defense, his defense has gone to another level.

ìThe way he communicates with us, his attention to detail. Everything, man. Itís incredible. Itís incredible to be his teammate and he brings it every night. He shows you that he wants to win, so Iím happy to have him next to me.î

Edwards finished with 22 points, seven rebounds, 12 assists and three blocks. Rudy Gobert added 17 points, missing just one of his nine shots, Mike Conley had 16, Jaden McDaniels had 14 and Donte DiVincenzo had 13 points off the bench.

Minnesota led by as many as 25 points in the third quarter and managed to hold off a late Warriors run that closed the gap to nine in the fourth.

Brandin Podziemski led the Warriors with a playoff career-high 28 points, while Jonathan Kuminga added 26 off the bench.

Jimmy Butler had another disappointing night, scoring just 17 points on 4-of-11 shooting.

Butler earned the ëPlayoff Jimmyí nickname for his monumental effort in dragging the Miami Heat to the NBA Finals in 2020 and 2023, but didnít get close to that level during this postseason.

Motorsport's world governing body dials back driver cursing penalties after major outcry,"The FIA, motorsportís world governing body, announced on Wednesday a major dialing back of the penalties issued to drivers for cursing after a groundswell of opposition towards the new regulations.

In rules introduced by the FIA ahead of the season, F1 drivers could be penalized ñ with monetary fines or loss of championship points ñ for cursing in press conferences.

Fines started at Ä40,000 ($41,600) for a driverís first offense, with it doubling for a second breach of the rules as well as a suspended one-month ban. A third offense would potentially bring about a Ä120,000 ($125,000) fine, a one-month ban and the loss of championship points.

But the FIA scaled back those regulations on Wednesday after continued complaints from high-level F1 drivers.

Following the amendment of Appendix B in FIA International Sporting Code, the base maximum penalties for drivers will be reduced generally from Ä10,000 ($11,210) to Ä5,000 ($5,600) ñ a reduction of 50% ñ although ìfor FIA World Championships, where multipliers were involved, the reductions will be even more significant,î the governing body said.

The FIA also said that stewards can suspend a penalty in certain cases if itís a first offense by a driver or team. Stewards will also be permitted to adjudge whether language was used in ìcontrolledî or ìuncontrolledî environments to assess whether a penalty is deemed necessary ñ a ìcontrolledî environment is defined as a press conferences and an ìuncontrolledî environment is a ìspontaneous comments made by drivers or teams when on track or during a rally stage.îThe new guidelines also state that ìabuse of officials will now result in sporting penalties rather than fines, aligning motor sport with other major global sports organizations.î

ìAs a former rally driver, I know firsthand the range of emotions that are faced during competition. I have led an extensive and collaborative review with contributions from across the seven FIA World Championships, FIA Member Clubs and other motor sports organizations,î FIA President Mohammed Ben Sulayem said.

ìThe improvements the FIA has announced today to Appendix B will ensure we continue to promote the best of sportsmanship in motor sport, while also giving Stewards effective guidelines to act against individuals who may bring the sport into disrepute. The FIA will always be committed to ensuring motor sport is accessible for all our sporting family.î

The original penalties implemented before this season were criticized by many F1 drivers who thought they were excessive. Drivers, including reigning world champion Max Verstappen, also complained about the lack of dialogue between them and the FIA around addressing any issues.Ronan Morgan, president of the driversí committee, said that the changing of the rules around cursing ìfurther strengthen the FIAís International Sporting Code supporting our drivers by understanding the pressures they face during the heat of competition.î

ìDrivers are looked up to as role models by young fans and are rightly seen as ambassadors for the wider world of motor sport, how they act really does matter but it is important to recognize that there is a difference between what is said during a race and in a press conference,î Morgan said.",15-May-25,World,Ben Morse,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/15/sport/fia-dials-back-driver-cursing-penalties-spt,,,,,,,,,,,,fia motorsport‚Äôs world governing body announced wednesday major dialing back penalties issued drivers cursing groundswell opposition towards new regulations rules introduced fia ahead season f drivers penalized ‚Äì monetary fines loss championship points ‚Äì cursing press conferences fines started ‚Ç¨ driver‚Äôs first offense doubling second breach rules well suspended onemonth ban third offense potentially bring ‚Ç¨ fine onemonth ban loss championship points fia scaled back regulations wednesday continued complaints highlevel f drivers following amendment appendix b fia international sporting code base maximum penalties drivers reduced generally ‚Ç¨ ‚Ç¨ ‚Äì reduction ‚Äì although ‚Äúfor fia world championships multipliers involved reductions even significant‚Äù governing body said fia also said stewards can suspend penalty certain cases it‚Äôs first offense driver team stewards also permitted adjudge whether language used ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù ‚Äúuncontrolled‚Äù environments assess whether penalty deemed necessary ‚Äì ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù environment defined press conferences ‚Äúuncontrolled‚Äù environment ‚Äúspontaneous comments made drivers teams track rally stage‚Äùthe new guidelines also state ‚Äúabuse officials now result sporting penalties rather fines aligning motor sport major global sports organizations‚Äù ‚Äúas former rally driver know firsthand range emotions faced competition led extensive collaborative review contributions across seven fia world championships fia member clubs motor sports organizations‚Äù fia president mohammed ben sulayem said ‚Äúthe improvements fia announced today appendix b ensure continue promote best sportsmanship motor sport also giving stewards effective guidelines act individuals may bring sport disrepute fia always committed ensuring motor sport accessible sporting family‚Äù original penalties implemented season criticized many f drivers thought excessive drivers including reigning world champion max verstappen also complained lack dialogue fia around addressing issuesronan morgan president drivers‚Äô committee said changing rules around cursing ‚Äúfurther strengthen fia‚Äôs international sporting code supporting drivers understanding pressures face heat competition‚Äù ‚Äúdrivers looked role models young fans rightly seen ambassadors wider world motor sport act really matter important recognize difference said race press conference‚Äù morgan said
"A Chinese EV giant is now offering free driver assistance tech on cars under $10,000","Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD has added an advanced driver-assistance system for most of its models at no additional cost, catapulting its shares to a record high.

Chinese customers can now experience the carmakerís proprietary ìGodís Eyeî driver-assistance system in models that cost as little as 69,800 yuan ($9,555).

Analysts said the move could further fuel a brutal, ongoing price war in the worldís biggest car market.

Shares of BYD surged more than 4% to a record high, according to Refinitiv data, when trading in Hong Kong began on Tuesday. Its shares were last trading at 330 Hong Kong dollars ($42).

ì2025 will be the first year of intelligent driving for all,î BYD Chairman Wang Chuanfu said in an event from its headquarters in Shenzhen on Monday.

Wang predicted that high-level intelligent driving will become an essential feature in automobiles, much like seat belts and airbags, within the next three years.Previously, the ìGodís Eyeî feature, introduced in 2023 to assist car navigation, was only offered in BYD models costing more than $30,000.

BYD ranked sixth in global car sales, with Chinaís Geely Auto following in tenth, Wang said onstage, citing research from Cailianshe, a state-linked media firm. It also dominated the Chinese market, accounting for over 32% of total new energy vehicle sales in 2024, according to China Passenger Car Association.

Tu Le, founder and managing director of the consultancy Sino Auto Insights, said BYDís move ìputs their competitors on their heelsî because of the affordable pricing.

Tesla, BYDís main rival, has released similar Full Self-Driving features in the US for a subscription fee of $99 a month or a one time payment of $8,000. It awaits regulatory approval to launch trials in the Chinese market.

How to keep your private conversations private,"As we all live more of our lives online, itís important to understand who might have access to our conversations and internet searches ñ and to understand how to maintain privacy in an increasingly connected world.

In the days since billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency associates have blazed through various government agencies, journalists have encouraged federal government workers to contact them through end-to-end encrypted platforms, like the messaging app Signal.

Signal is one of a number of relatively simple tools that can be used not only to help keep secure conversations with reporters, but also for communicating with colleagues when not discussing work projects, researching legal resources or even chatting with friends.

Use personal devices and networks
Itís safe to assume that anything you do on a work computer or phone could be visible to your employer, because they have the right to monitor usage of devices they own.

ìYou want to think about who has access to the communications that youíre making if youíre worried that someone might try to retaliate you for having these discussions,î said Daniel Kahn Gillmor, a senior staff technologist for the ACLUís Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project.

With that in mind, itís a good idea to use a personal device for personal conversations and Google searches.The same goes for using an employerís Wi-Fi network, on which they may be able to connect the dots between employee communications. Save any griping about work for your home network or your personal phone plan.

On work Wi-Fi, ìthey wonít necessarily see what tea youíre spilling, but they will see who youíre spilling it to,î Gillmor said.

Signal
There are a number of tech platforms that advertise encryption services for privacy ó including iMessage and WhatsApp ó but data security experts largely agree that Signal is the gold standard.

Signal looks like a regular messaging app for texting and making phone calls. But itís owned by a non-profit, not a private company, and the app is end-to-end encrypted by default. That means that the content of a conversation is scrambled when itís traveling between the sender and receiver, so no one except the parties to the conversation can see it.

ìIf you show up with a warrant or a subpoena (to Signal), they have almost nothing about you that they can hand over,î said Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. On non-encrypted messaging apps, an employer or law enforcement could potentially force a platform to hand over a userís conversations via subpoena.

End-to-end encryption itself isnít unique among messaging apps, but certain apps that offer encryption, like WhatsApp, may still have access to non-encrypted contacts and other accounts youíve messaged, whereas Signalís builders canít see that information, according to Gillmor.

And whether you use Signal or WhatsApp, experts advise turning on the ìdisappearing messagesî feature that allows users to auto-delete conversations after a set period of time ó hours, or days, depending on what a user selects ó so that the conversations might not be accessible even if someone else got their hands on a userís phone.

Tor browser
Many people are familiar with VPNs, or virtual private networks, which act kind of like a tunnel between your device and the internet that can mask where your internet traffic is coming from.

VPNs can be a more private way of accessing the internet, but nevertheless, the VPN company could, in theory, be forced to hand over the information it has about your internet traffic.

ìWhen you use a VPN, the VPN company can see all your traffic, they see where youíre coming from and where youíre going. So, if somebody on the other end of the transaction sees an IP address that belongs to a VPN company, they can submit a subpoena to the VPN company,î Galperin said.

The most secure option, security experts say, is to use Tor browser. Itís a browser that users can download just like Firefox or Safari, but that distributes internet traffic across a global network of different ìnodes,î or computers, so that any one userís traffic could not be accessed from a single access point. With Tor, the websites a user visits are also blocked from viewing that userís IP address, which could allow them to be identified.

If youíve used Tor and ìsomeone later sends a warrant to Google asking for all the searches that have been made from your home computer or your logged-in Google browser, they wonít see searches for ëgood journalist to leak to,íî Galperin said.

Many news organizations also have SecureDrop folders, allowing users to share encrypted documents and communications anonymously when using Tor.

Other best practices
Some companies have taken aggressive measures to identify employees who leak information, such as watermarking or tweaking emails so that different employees receive slightly different versions of the same message.

For that reason, security experts encourage people to be cautious about sending exact copies or photos of emails or documents. And any documents printed out could include ìprinter dots,î invisible tracking codes that can indicate the time, date and location where something was printed.

And keep in mind that violating a non-disclosure agreement or sharing confidential information could expose you to legal risk if you are identified.

Still, Gillmor said it can be a good idea to identify private channels of communication with colleagues or friends.

ìProtecting our rights is a team sport,î Gillmor said. ìTaking the time to figure out how to do some of these things and helping your friends figure out how to do these things, even if you never end up using them in more drastic ways Ö is still a positive thing.î",9-Feb-25,World,Clare Duffy,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/09/tech/secure-chat-apps-signal-tor-browser,,,,,,,,,,,,live lives online it‚Äôs important understand might access conversations internet searches ‚Äì understand maintain privacy increasingly connected world days since billionaire elon musk department government efficiency associates blazed various government agencies journalists encouraged federal government workers contact endtoend encrypted platforms like messaging app signal signal one number relatively simple tools can used help keep secure conversations reporters also communicating colleagues discussing work projects researching legal resources even chatting friends use personal devices networks it‚Äôs safe assume anything work computer phone visible employer right monitor usage devices ‚Äúyou want think access communications you‚Äôre making you‚Äôre worried someone might try retaliate discussions‚Äù said daniel kahn gillmor senior staff technologist aclu‚Äôs speech privacy technology project mind it‚Äôs good idea use personal device personal conversations google searchesthe goes using employer‚Äôs wifi network may able connect dots employee communications save griping work home network personal phone plan work wifi ‚Äúthey won‚Äôt necessarily see tea you‚Äôre spilling see you‚Äôre spilling to‚Äù gillmor said signal number tech platforms advertise encryption services privacy ‚Äî including imessage whatsapp ‚Äî data security experts largely agree signal gold standard signal looks like regular messaging app texting making phone calls it‚Äôs owned nonprofit private company app endtoend encrypted default means content conversation scrambled it‚Äôs traveling sender receiver one except parties conversation can see tesla ceo elon musk speaks rally president donald trump madison square garden related article lived elon musk‚Äôs twitter takeover now advice federal government employees ‚Äúif show warrant subpoena signal almost nothing can hand over‚Äù said eva galperin director cybersecurity electronic frontier foundation nonencrypted messaging apps employer law enforcement potentially force platform hand user‚Äôs conversations via subpoena endtoend encryption isn‚Äôt unique among messaging apps certain apps offer encryption like whatsapp may still access nonencrypted contacts accounts you‚Äôve messaged whereas signal‚Äôs builders can‚Äôt see information according gillmor whether use signal whatsapp experts advise turning ‚Äúdisappearing messages‚Äù feature allows users autodelete conversations set period time ‚Äî hours days depending user selects ‚Äî conversations might accessible even someone else got hands user‚Äôs phone tor browser many people familiar vpns virtual private networks act kind like tunnel device internet can mask internet traffic coming vpns can private way accessing internet nevertheless vpn company theory forced hand information internet traffic ‚Äúwhen use vpn vpn company can see traffic see you‚Äôre coming you‚Äôre going somebody end transaction sees ip address belongs vpn company can submit subpoena vpn company‚Äù galperin said secure option security experts say use tor browser it‚Äôs browser users can download just like firefox safari distributes internet traffic across global network different ‚Äúnodes‚Äù computers one user‚Äôs traffic accessed single access point tor websites user visits also blocked viewing user‚Äôs ip address allow identified you‚Äôve used tor ‚Äúsomeone later sends warrant google asking searches made home computer loggedin google browser won‚Äôt see searches ‚Äògood journalist leak to‚Äô‚Äù galperin said many news organizations also securedrop folders allowing users share encrypted documents communications anonymously using tor best practices companies taken aggressive measures identify employees leak information watermarking tweaking emails different employees receive slightly different versions message reason security experts encourage people cautious sending exact copies photos emails documents documents printed include ‚Äúprinter dots‚Äù invisible tracking codes can indicate time date location something printed keep mind violating nondisclosure agreement sharing confidential information expose legal risk identified still gillmor said can good idea identify private channels communication colleagues friends ‚Äúprotecting rights team sport‚Äù gillmor said ‚Äútaking time figure things helping friends figure things even never end using drastic ways ‚Ä¶ still positive thing‚Äù
DeepSeek hasn't just disrupted OpenAI. Chinese tech giants are being upended too,"DeepSeekís advances have roiled global stock markets and AI players. Now, its influence is spreading quickly at home, with some of Chinaís biggest tech companies, many of which had been developing their own chatbots, racing to incorporate the open-source model into their own services.

In early February telecoms giant Huawei said it would run DeepSeek on its own computing hardware composed of its Ascend computer processors, which are domestically produced.

Some AI watchers have hailed this as a turning point, as it demonstrates that a high-performing model like DeepSeek no longer requires Nvidiaís most powerful chips to operate.

ìThis partnership defies US sanctions by proving China can deliver globally competitive AI performance using domestically developed AI hardware and software stack, replacing Nvidia chips with Ascend chips,î analysts at Bernstein, an investment and research firm, wrote in a research note earlier this month.

Starting in late 2022, the Biden Administration imposed several rounds of export controls on China in an effort to deprive the country of technology that Washington fears Beijing could use to make the next generation of weapons and AI systems.

But the success of DeepSeekís latest R1 AI model, which is said to be trained at a fraction of the cost of established players like ChatGPT, challenged the assumption that cutting off access to advanced chips could successfully stymie Chinaís progress.Such is DeepSeekís fame that leading Chinese AI chipmakers ó including Moore Threads, Tencent-backed Enflame, Baiduís Kunlunxin and Hygon Information Technology ó have also announced support for the firm, running the AI model on their own computing chips.Beyond chips
Beyond chipmakers, the cloud arms of major Chinese technology companies have also rushed to incorporate DeepSeekís technology into their offerings.Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, and TikTok parent Bytedance announced they had made Deepseekís service available through their cloud platforms. The countryís three major telecom operators, along with electronics maker Lenovo and auto brand Geely, have also adopted DeepSeek into their cloud platforms and products.

ìIt serves as recognition for open-source large-model companies. If your model is good enough, AI giants will integrate it into their platforms,î said Lian Jye Su, chief analyst at Omdia, a technology research firm.

These major Chinese tech firms, which have dominated the countryís internet scene for more than a decade, began rolling out their own large language models over the past two years since the debut of ChatGPT in late 2022.

Despite having competing products they have welcomed DeepSeek. Su said the primary reason for their adoption is to attract more people and businesses to use their platforms.

ìIn reality, making money directly from large models is difficult for AI giants ó unless there are mature consumer and enterprise applications to support them,î he said.

Their moves reflect a wider trend. American Big Tech ó including Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon ó have similarly embraced DeepSeek.

Topping the charts
Deepseek, the Hangzhou-based startup founded in 2023, sent shock waves around the world last month when it launched its newest AI model.

Its AI Assistant app quickly topped global download charts, surpassing ChatGPT in late January. Within 20 days of launch, its daily active users have exceeded 22 million, according to state media.

Its success has catapulted its founder, Liang Wenfeng, into the ranks of national heroes. Despite the optimism, analysts caution that bottlenecks in Chinaís AI chip development remain due to US export restrictions.

ìPorting DeepSeek models to different chip architectures is a lot of low-level software work, and the fact they could do so quickly is amazing, but it doesnít solve the chip shortage problem,î said Linghao Bao, senior analyst at Trivium China, a research and advisory firm.

The ramp-up of advanced chip production continues to be hampered by the absence of advanced chipmaking equipment, which the US has banned from being exported to China, he said.

And outside China, DeepSeekís rapid rise has drawn scrutiny from various governments. Last week, Taiwan and Australia banned their government officials from using the Chinese AI service over data security risks.

Some South Korean ministries and government departments have also issued bans. Last month, Italy imposed a blanket block on DeepSeekís app after the company failed to address privacy concerns raised by the authorities. More countries have since raised concerns over the firmís data practices.

ëIt pains our soulsí: Venezuelans react to first video of relatives in Salvadoran prison after Matt Gaetz TV report,"Sitting on a couch in her home in Maracay, Venezuela, Mirelis Cacique LÛpez watches her son Francisco Javier GarcÌa Cacique on her cell phone in the first video released of a group of Venezuelans sent by the United States to El Salvadorís maximum-security prison Cecot.

ìAmong the boys, I recognized my son,î Cacique LÛpez said to CNN. ìWe thank God for allowing us to see our relatives, even in those conditions,î she added, insisting that she will continue to pray for their release.

The video aired Tuesday on the One America News Network, on a show hosted by former US Republican congressman Matt Gaetz. He visited Cecot and had access to the prison wing housing the group of more than 200 Venezuelans deported by President Donald Trumpís administration, many under the controversial use of the Alien Enemies Act, accused largely without evidence of being members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.

The report shows a roughly one-minute clip of the Venezuelans behind bars, dressed in white T-shirts and shorts, the Cecot prisonersí uniform. From the moment the TV cameras enter the prison, the detainees react with shouts of ìFreedom, freedom!î and ìVenezuela!î while another group makes a fist with four fingers over their thumbs, a universal gesture asking of help.

Yenni Luz RincÛn RamÌrez identified her brother Jonathan Miguel RamÌrez in the video. ìI felt joy because I was finally able to see him after 60 days,î she told CNN from Venezuela. She insisted that her brotherís detention is unjust and asserted that he is not a member of Tren de Aragua.

RincÛn RamÌrez isnít the only one whoís been able to see a loved one for the first time since the deportations were announced in March.Blanca MartÌnez told CNN that she learned her partner Miguel ¡ngel Rojas had been deported to El Salvador through a list published by media outlets. She hadnít heard from him since. So far, neither the US nor the Salvadoran government has published official lists with the names of those deported to Cecot.

ìIt made me sad to see him there without knowing how he really is,î MartÌnez said, adding that Rojas suffers from depression and that knowing he is detained at Cecot causes her great anguish.

Angie RÌos, a US citizen, told CNN in a telephone interview that she recognized her husband Jes˙s RÌos in the video. ìI saw him and I heard him,î she said. ìHeís the most handsome of all,î she said affectionately about her partner. RÌos added the last time she saw her husband was on March 15. ìHeís in survival mode,î RÌos said when she saw Jes˙s, saying he was one of the detainees shouting ìFreedom!î

ìI feel like in that video heís fighting for his voice to be heard.î

CNN has not been able to verify whether these individuals have criminal records in the US and has contacted the Department of Homeland Security for comment.

Following the release of the video, Venezuelan President Nicol·s Maduro again condemned what he considers to be a kidnapping of Venezuelan citizens to El Salvador.

ìI swear that we will rescue the 253 Venezuelans kidnapped in El Salvador, in concentration camps, as seen today,î he said on Tuesday. ìLet us demand that these young people who are kidnapped without trial, without the right to appear before a judge, without the right to a defense, without having committed any crime, be released immediately. And we are ready to pick them up on a Venezuelan plane and bring them back to their families,î he added.

CNN has reached out to the Salvadoran presidency for comment on Maduroís statements.

In April, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele proposed to Maduro an exchange of people deported to and detained in his country and for what he considers ìpolitical prisonersî of the Venezuelan government. Maduro responded by demanding access to the prisoners for lawyers and family members.

In March, El Salvador agreed to detain in Cecot up to 300 immigrants sent by the Trump administration. El Salvador would receive approximately $6 million from the US to hold them there, according to an agreement between the two governments.",15-May-25,World,"Ana Melgar, Caroll Alvarado",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/14/americas/venezuela-salvador-prison-video-intl-latam-hnk,,,,,,,,,,,,sitting couch home maracay venezuela mirelis cacique l√≥pez watches son francisco javier garc√≠a cacique cell phone first video released group venezuelans sent united states el salvador‚Äôs maximumsecurity prison cecot ‚Äúamong boys recognized son‚Äù cacique l√≥pez said cnn ‚Äúwe thank god allowing us see relatives even conditions‚Äù added insisting continue pray release video aired tuesday one america news network show hosted former us republican congressman matt gaetz visited cecot access prison wing housing group venezuelans deported president donald trump‚Äôs administration many controversial use alien enemies act accused largely without evidence members venezuelan gang tren de aragua report shows roughly oneminute clip venezuelans behind bars dressed white tshirts shorts cecot prisoners‚Äô uniform moment tv cameras enter prison detainees react shouts ‚Äúfreedom freedom‚Äù ‚Äúvenezuela‚Äù another group makes fist four fingers thumbs universal gesture asking help yenni luz rinc√≥n ram√≠rez identified brother jonathan miguel ram√≠rez video ‚Äúi felt joy finally able see days‚Äù told cnn venezuela insisted brother‚Äôs detention unjust asserted member tren de aragua rinc√≥n ram√≠rez isn‚Äôt one who‚Äôs able see loved one first time since deportations announced marchblanca mart√≠nez told cnn learned partner miguel √°ngel rojas deported el salvador list published media outlets hadn‚Äôt heard since far neither us salvadoran government published official lists names deported cecot ‚Äúit made sad see without knowing really is‚Äù mart√≠nez said adding rojas suffers depression knowing detained cecot causes great anguish angie r√≠os us citizen told cnn telephone interview recognized husband jes√∫s r√≠os video ‚Äúi saw heard him‚Äù said ‚Äúhe‚Äôs handsome all‚Äù said affectionately partner r√≠os added last time saw husband march ‚Äúhe‚Äôs survival mode‚Äù r√≠os said saw jes√∫s saying one detainees shouting ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù ‚Äúi feel like video he‚Äôs fighting voice heard‚Äù cnn able verify whether individuals criminal records us contacted department homeland security comment following release video venezuelan president nicol√°s maduro condemned considers kidnapping venezuelan citizens el salvador ‚Äúi swear rescue venezuelans kidnapped el salvador concentration camps seen today‚Äù said tuesday ‚Äúlet us demand young people kidnapped without trial without right appear judge without right defense without committed crime released immediately ready pick venezuelan plane bring back families‚Äù added cnn reached salvadoran presidency comment maduro‚Äôs statements april salvadoran president nayib bukele proposed maduro exchange people deported detained country considers ‚Äúpolitical prisoners‚Äù venezuelan government maduro responded demanding access prisoners lawyers family members march el salvador agreed detain cecot immigrants sent trump administration el salvador receive approximately million us hold according agreement two governments
"A US-backed group says it will deliver aid to Gaza, but humanitarian organizations are skeptical. Here's what we know","A controversial new American-backed organization, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), has announced it will begin delivering aid to the besieged territory within two weeks and says it has Israelís approval.

The move would provide some relief for Gazans facing acute hunger from 19 months of war and a two-and-half month Israeli blockade of all food, water, medical and humanitarian supplies.

More than half of Gazaís population faces ìemergencyî or ìcatastrophicî levels of hunger, according to a UN-backed panel considered an authority on the matter.


But the foundation has come under significant criticism from top humanitarian officials, who warn that it is insufficient, could endanger civilians and even encourage their forced displacement.

Hereís what we know about the new aid mechanism.

Why is Israel blocking food from entering Gaza?
Israel started a total blockade on Gaza on March 2, the day after the initial phase of a ceasefire with Hamas expired.Officials said their goal was to force the group to accept new ceasefire terms and release hostages taken from Israel on October 7, 2023.

Israel and the United States have also accused Hamas of stealing aid intended for Gazaís civilian population. Hamas has rejected those claims, and humanitarian aid organizations say the overwhelming majority of food aid reaches civilians in need.Whatever the motivation, the impact is clear.

The hunger crisis long predates Israelís total blockade. Since Hamasí attack, Israel has severely restricted the amount of aid that can enter Gaza. And even before October 2023, Israel and Egypt had imposed a partial blockade on Gaza, meaning that 63% of the population was food insecure. 

Now that figure is 100%, according to the World Food Programme (WFP). It says that 70,000 children need urgent treatment for ìacute malnutrition.î

What is the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation?
Itís a non-profit set up at the urging of the American government to help alleviate hunger in Gaza, while complying with Israeli demands that the aid not reach Hamas.

The American ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, laid out some of the goals for the organization in a press conference in Jerusalem last week.Where would the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation get its food and money?
Itís unclear.

In its announcement this week, the GHF said that it was ìin the final stages of procuring large volumes of food aid to supplement existing pledges from humanitarian organizations operating in Gaza.î It said that that would equate to more than 300 million meals.

It did not list the suppliers.

Huckabee told reporters last week that ìthere are some people who have already committed to helping fundî but that ìthey donít want to be disclosed as of yet.î",15-May-25,World,Mick Krever,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/15/middleeast/gaza-humanitarian-foundation-aid-israel-intl,,,,,,,,,,,,controversial new americanbacked organization gaza humanitarian foundation ghf announced begin delivering aid besieged territory within two weeks says israel‚Äôs approval move provide relief gazans facing acute hunger months war twoandhalf month israeli blockade food water medical humanitarian supplies half gaza‚Äôs population faces ‚Äúemergency‚Äù ‚Äúcatastrophic‚Äù levels hunger according unbacked panel considered authority matter foundation come significant criticism top humanitarian officials warn insufficient endanger civilians even encourage forced displacement here‚Äôs know new aid mechanism israel blocking food entering gaza israel started total blockade gaza march day initial phase ceasefire hamas expiredofficials said goal force group accept new ceasefire terms release hostages taken israel october israel united states also accused hamas stealing aid intended gaza‚Äôs civilian population hamas rejected claims humanitarian aid organizations say overwhelming majority food aid reaches civilians needwhatever motivation impact clear hunger crisis long predates israel‚Äôs total blockade since hamas‚Äô attack israel severely restricted amount aid can enter gaza even october israel egypt imposed partial blockade gaza meaning population food insecure now figure according world food programme wfp says children need urgent treatment ‚Äúacute malnutrition‚Äù gaza humanitarian foundation it‚Äôs nonprofit set urging american government help alleviate hunger gaza complying israeli demands aid reach hamas american ambassador israel mike huckabee laid goals organization press conference jerusalem last weekwhere gaza humanitarian foundation get food money it‚Äôs unclear announcement week ghf said ‚Äúin final stages procuring large volumes food aid supplement existing pledges humanitarian organizations operating gaza‚Äù said equate million meals list suppliers huckabee told reporters last week ‚Äúthere people already committed helping fund‚Äù ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt want disclosed yet‚Äù
Trump says US is ëvery closeí to a nuclear deal after Iran ëagreedí to its terms,"US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that Washington is ìvery closeî to reaching a nuclear deal with Iran after Tehran ìsort ofî agreed to its terms.

ìIran has sort of agreed to the terms: Theyíre not going to make, I call it, in a friendly way, nuclear dust. Weíre not going to be making any nuclear dust in Iran,î he said.

Iranian officials havenít publicly commented on Trumpís remarks, though the comments were reported by the countryís semi-official ISNA news agency. CNN has requested a comment from Iranís mission to the United Nations.

Speaking at a business roundtable in the Qatari capital Doha, Trump reiterated that Iran ìcanít have a nuclear weaponî and suggested that negotiators are ìgetting very close to maybe doing a deal.îDuring his Gulf tour, Trump has repeatedly warned that Iran must never obtain a nuclear weapon, threatening to strike the country if it fails to reach a nuclear deal. But he has not explicitly ruled out Iran enriching uranium on its own soil. While uranium is used as a nuclear fuel, it can be weaponized if enriched to high levels.In an interview with Breitbart last week, US foreign envoy Steve Witkoff said that an enrichment program in Iran is a ìred lineî for the US. In an earlier interview with Fox News, he had suggested that Iran could be allowed to enrich uranium to low levels.

Several rounds of talks have taken place between the US and Iran, but the most recent one in the Omani capital Muscat last weekend was described by the Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson as ìdifficult.î

A senior Trump administration official gave a more positive assessment, telling CNN the discussions, which lasted over three hours, were encouraging.

Global oil prices fell after Trumpís comments. The price of a barrel of Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, fell over 3% Thursday morning to $64 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate, the US oil benchmark, was trading down 3.5% to almost $61 a barrel around the same time.

ëWe are going to protect this countryí
It is unclear what Trump meant by ìnuclear dust,î but Gulf states, including Qatar, are concerned that an attack on Iranís nuclear facilities could cause an environmental catastrophe in the region and drag them into a wider regional war.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian lambasted the threatening remarks by Trump.

The US president ìis naive for thinking that he can come to our region, threaten us, and hope that we back down against his demands,î Pezeshkian told a group of academics during a gathering in Kermanshah Province on Wednesday, according to the Iranian media. ìWe will never negotiate our dignity. This is in the blood of every Iranian,î

ìYou have tried to bring Iran to its knees for the past 47 years. We have existed for thousands of years and will continue as one for the years to come,î he said.

On Wednesday, Trump repeated his threats, saying he doesnít want nuclear talks in Iran to take a ìviolent course.î

ìTwo courses, thereís only two courses. There arenít three or four or five, thereís two. Thereís a friendly and a non-friendly, and non-friendly is a violent course, and I donít want that. Iíll say it up front. I donít want that, but they have to get moving,î the president said.

Speaking in Doha, Trump vowed to ìprotectî Qatar.

ìFor this country in particular, because youíre right next door, youíre a stoneís throw away, not even, right? Youíre a foot away. You can walk right into Iran. Other countries are much further away, so probably itís not quite the same level of danger, but we are going to protect this country, this very special place with a special royal family,î he said.",15-May-25,World,"Betsy Klein, Nadeen Ebrahim",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/15/middleeast/trump-us-close-nuclear-deal-iran-intl,,,,,,,,,,,,us president donald trump said thursday washington ‚Äúvery close‚Äù reaching nuclear deal iran tehran ‚Äúsort of‚Äù agreed terms ‚Äúiran sort agreed terms they‚Äôre going make call friendly way nuclear dust we‚Äôre going making nuclear dust iran‚Äù said iranian officials haven‚Äôt publicly commented trump‚Äôs remarks though comments reported country‚Äôs semiofficial isna news agency cnn requested comment iran‚Äôs mission united nations speaking business roundtable qatari capital doha trump reiterated iran ‚Äúcan‚Äôt nuclear weapon‚Äù suggested negotiators ‚Äúgetting close maybe deal‚Äùduring gulf tour trump repeatedly warned iran must never obtain nuclear weapon threatening strike country fails reach nuclear deal explicitly ruled iran enriching uranium soil uranium used nuclear fuel can weaponized enriched high levelsin interview breitbart last week us foreign envoy steve witkoff said enrichment program iran ‚Äúred line‚Äù us earlier interview fox news suggested iran allowed enrich uranium low levels several rounds talks taken place us iran recent one omani capital muscat last weekend described iranian foreign ministry spokesperson ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù senior trump administration official gave positive assessment telling cnn discussions lasted three hours encouraging global oil prices fell trump‚Äôs comments price barrel brent crude global oil benchmark fell thursday morning barrel west texas intermediate us oil benchmark trading almost barrel around time ‚Äòwe going protect country‚Äô unclear trump meant ‚Äúnuclear dust‚Äù gulf states including qatar concerned attack iran‚Äôs nuclear facilities cause environmental catastrophe region drag wider regional wariranian president masoud pezeshkian lambasted threatening remarks trump us president ‚Äúis naive thinking can come region threaten us hope back demands‚Äù pezeshkian told group academics gathering kermanshah province wednesday according iranian media ‚Äúwe never negotiate dignity blood every iranian‚Äù ‚Äúyou tried bring iran knees past years existed thousands years continue one years come‚Äù said wednesday trump repeated threats saying doesn‚Äôt want nuclear talks iran take ‚Äúviolent course‚Äù ‚Äútwo courses there‚Äôs two courses aren‚Äôt three four five there‚Äôs two there‚Äôs friendly nonfriendly nonfriendly violent course don‚Äôt want i‚Äôll say front don‚Äôt want get moving‚Äù president said speaking doha trump vowed ‚Äúprotect‚Äù qatar ‚Äúfor country particular you‚Äôre right next door you‚Äôre stone‚Äôs throw away even right you‚Äôre foot away can walk right iran countries much away probably it‚Äôs quite level danger going protect country special place special royal family‚Äù said
"ëOur Russian Town!í Content creators paint a rosy picture of life in occupied Mariupol, with support from the Kremlin","Three years after it seized control of Mariupol following a brutal 86-day siege, Russia is using a more subtle power to keep its grip on the Ukrainian port city: social media influencers.

A CNN investigation found that residents of the occupied city, including schoolchildren, are being trained in new media programs and ìblogger schoolsî with ties to the Russian state.

Though their follower counts and overall reach pale in comparison to celebrity influencers, experts say that the Kremlin needs local voices to effectively promote life under Russiaís rule.

ìJust look what Russia is getting up to in Mariupol,î Pavel Karbovsky, a teacher at one of the blogger schools, said in a recent TikTok video highlighting the construction of new apartment buildings. ìWait, theyíre building, not demolishingÖ this is Mariupol, our Russian town!î

Karbovsky is among a growing number of content creators painting a picture of renewal in cities and towns across the four Ukrainian regions illegally annexed by Russia in 2022 ñ Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. He said he is not operating as a propagandist. Instead, his mission is ìto show the truthî about life in Russian-occupied areas, he told CNN in a video interview from Donetsk.But Russian-backed occupation officials have been actively encouraging creators like Karbovksy to post about the restoration of the ìliberatedî territories, including in official meetings.

In January, Karbovsky was among a group of content creators invited to meet with Denis Pushilin, the Russian-backed head of the Donetsk Peopleís Republic (DPR). Pushilin said in a statement on Telegram that he was ìcountingî on the group to spread the word that the eastern Donbas region was ìbeing revived.î

ìWe are all united by an immense desire to restore and revive Donbas. And people should know as much information as possible about the large-scale work that is already underway,î the post continued.

CNN analyzed over a dozen profiles of local influencers promoting Moscowís Russification project in Mariupol on social media platforms, some of which are openly pro-Russia and blame Ukraine for the pain inflicted on the region, while others appear apolitical. Despite their modest audiences ñ ranging from 3,000 to 36,000 on TikTok ñ their reconstruction-focused content can garner hundreds of thousands of views.

But absent from their videos is any context on the reason for rebuilding.

Russiaís siege of the port city, once known as a hub for trade and manufacturing, was one of the deadliest and most destructive battles since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago.

According to United Nations estimates, 90% of residential buildings were damaged or destroyed in Mariupol during Russian attacks, and around 350,000 people out of the pre-war population of about 430,000 were forced to flee. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a recent interview that 20,000 civilians are believed to have been killed, though the death toll is impossible to verify. Ukrainian officials accused Moscow of trying to cover up evidence of civilian casualties, a claim the Kremlin denies.ìMoscow seeks to interrupt the flow of information about the terrible destruction brought by the Russian army,î Ihor Solovey, director of the Ukrainian governmentís Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security, said in written comments to CNN. To counter this, he said, Ukraine is trying to ìconvey even more facts about the crimes of the occupiers,î adding that ìthere are more than enough of them to completely refute any Russian fakes about the ëbeautiful lifeí under occupation.î

For Moscow, maintaining control of Mariupol remains a strategic priority and a focus of significant investment. ìWe are paying a lot of attention to Mariupol,î Russian President Vladimir Putin said during his annual press conference in December. In March 2023, he staged a highly choreographed trip to the city, discussing ìrestorationî efforts with local officials. In a video that circulated online of him meeting residents, a voice off-camera could be heard shouting: ìItís all lies, itís just for show.îWhile construction is clearly ongoing, CNNís analysis of satellite imagery, interviews with residents and videos posted to social media show significant destruction remains. Many who lost their homes in 2022 have not been rehoused and the quality of new housing is often inadequate. Residents say Russian authorities are also seizing homes from Ukrainians who fled the city to give to others.

ìThey have created a kind of Potemkin pictureÖ But people donít live there, in many houses, they donít live there,î one Mariupol resident said, referencing the fake villages built by Grigory Potemkin in 18th-century Russia to impress Catherine the Great. He spoke to CNN anonymously for fear of reprisals.

CNN has reached out to the Russian-backed mayor of Mariupol and the Russian government for comment on the claims.

Training new voices
In September, an organization called the Donbass Media Centre (DMC) opened its ìblogger schoolî in Mariupol. It offers free two-week courses designed to give aspiring influencers a technical grounding in skills like filming and editing, as well as an understanding of how to gain popularity and make money online.Similar courses had already been held in Donetsk and Luhansk, and another followed in Melitopol, in the Russian-occupied part of Zaporizhzhia. Karbovsky was one of the teachers.

ìI know how to gather views, make content so I was invited to teach kids between 16 and 22,î he told CNN. Neither Karbovsky, nor the schoolís coordinator would tell CNN who finances the program, but it appears to have the tacit support of the Russian government.The DMC was set up by Donbass Media, a pro-Russian news channel mostly operating on social media. In 2024, the DMC won a Runet Prize, a national award of the Russian Federation and Presidential Foundation for Cultural Initiatives that celebrates excellence on the Russian internet. It also has a partnership with ìTop Blog,î a competition for content creators run by a Kremlin program called ìRussia - Land of Opportunities.î Last year, the most successful DMC students won a trip to Moscow to visit the headquarters of Vkontakte, Russiaís version of Facebook.

Vkontakte is among several Russian social media networks owned by state-run Gazprom-Media. The Kremlin has clamped down its control of social media in recent years, through ownership, internet slowdowns, and, more recently, legislation requiring influencers with over 10,000 followers to register their personal details with Russiaís media regulator, Roskomnadzor.

Karbovsky said the DMCís aims are not political. ìDMC does not have any such goal to create some sort of propagandists ñ no way. We donít need this,î he said. ìWe want people to be able to share their different views about what is happening in the DPR (Donetsk Peopleís Republic) and the LPR (Luhansk Peopleís Republic) and other regions.î

The same month the DMC opened its ìblogger schoolî in Mariupol, graduates of a Russian government program called ìThe New Media Workshopî opened a media center in Mariupol to teach schoolchildren 14- to 17-years-old photography, filming and how ìto work in the social networks.î The free program is funded in part by a Russian presidential grant worth around $12,000. Participants are encouraged to show the positive side of Mariupol.

ìWe look forward to welcoming talented kids, so together we can talk about the life of our beloved city,î reads an October Telegram post from the media center. In another, a participant in the course interviews children about how Mariupol has changed. ìItís become much more interesting, more colorful,î says one young girl. ìItís developing quickly,î her friend adds.In March, Rutube ñ an alternative to YouTube owned by Russiaís Gazprom-Media ñ announced it was setting up ìstudiosî in cities and towns across the four annexed regions, including in Mariupol, where content creators could access high-tech equipment and training programs. The initiative is part of a joint project with the Russian Military Historical Society, which Putin created by presidential decree in 2012 to ìcounter attempts to distortî Russiaís military history.

ìThe world now really needs the truth about the lives of the new Russian citizens who have gone through a lotÖ but chose to speak Russian, think and dream in Russian,î one of the organizers said in a press release.

Andrei Soldatov, an expert in Russiaís intelligence services and state surveillance on the internet, says thereís no doubt who is directing these efforts. ìItís top level, itís not regional, itís not decided on the level of say the administrations of the occupied territories. Itís all about the Kremlin,î he told CNN.

Subtle messaging
Most of the social media accounts CNN analyzed started posting after Russiaís invasion and share content with a common theme: portraying Russian revival efforts in Mariupol in a positive light.

ìWhen I heard people say Mariupol was a bad city, that nothingís left of it, I wanted to show that the city is alive, is recovering, and thatís why I started showing what is really happening here,î Elizaveta Chervyakova, a 21-year-old DMC graduate from Mariupol, told CNN in a video interview from the city.

One of her most popular recent videos, with over 177,000 views, is a montage of both damaged and rebuilt buildings in the city set to a voice-over that states: ìMariupol ñ the seaside capital of Southern Russia.î

She told CNN that posting about the regionís recovery is becoming a trend.

ìLook how beautiful,î another content creator, known as ìMasha from Mariupol,î says in a TikTok video showing off newly built apartment blocks at sunset. ìThese apartments are filled with happy peopleÖ a wonderful region for family life.î

In other clips, she poses in front of a war memorial, gives a tour of the reopened railway station and shows off construction at the Drama Theater, where hundreds of civilians were killed in a Russian airstrike.Shiny rooftops of restored, or in some cases newly built, apartment blocks are visible dotted in and around the city center, having mostly replaced buildings destroyed in the war, satellite images from late 2024 show.

But in other areas the scars of the conflict are still visible.

In a satellite image from December last year, a crane can be seen next to the Drama Theater, where the Russian word for children, ????, was scrawled in the spring of 2022 ñ a failed attempt to deter Russian bombs. Russian state media has reported that the theater will be finished this year.

In December, Putin claimed in a press conference that at least 300,000 people had returned to Mariupol and said, ìthe population continues to grow at a rapid pace.î In March, he signed a decree ordering all residents of the four regions to get a Russian passport by September 10 or leave.

Mariupolís Ukrainian exiled mayor, Vadym Boichenko, told CNN that only around 100,000 Ukrainians are estimated to remain in the city ñ including some who left during the siege and have since returned.

Boichenko said he believes Russians are being lured there not only through positive news stories and social media posts, but also by Russiaís preferential 2% mortgage rate for its ìnew territoriesî ñ a significant draw in a country where market rates are currently as high as 29%.

Russia has promised to provide ìcompensatory housingî to everyone affected by the war, but in videos circulating mainly on Telegram, groups of Mariupol residents claim they still have not received their apartments and deliver direct appeals to Putin for homes.

In one video that surfaced in January, some hold up a sign that reads ì?????,î a Russian acronym meaning ìhomeless people.î One person says they are being offered apartments belonging to residents who left Mariupol. ìWe earned our apartments, we donít want other peoples,î she says, urging the authorities to continue building. The Russian-installed mayor of Mariupol has said some residents will be given ìabandonedî properties, effectively stripping those who left the ability to return.",15-May-25,World,"Clare Sebastian,

In pictures: The world mourns Pope Francis,"The death of Pope Francis has triggered a period of mourning across the globe, and tens of thousands of people flocked to the Vatican to pay their respects.

Francis, the first Latin American pope in history, died Monday at the age of 88.

His funeral was held Saturday, and many world leaders attended the ceremony, which took place mostly in St. Peter's Square. Vatican authorities said that more than 250,000 people participated in the service.

After nine days of mourning, all cardinals under the age of 80 will convene in the Vatican to pick Francisí successor.

It typically takes between two and three weeks for a pope to be chosen following the death of his predecessor, though it can stretch slightly beyond that if cardinals struggle to agree on a candidate.",4/27/2025,World,Brett Roegiers,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/21/world/gallery/pope-francis-death-reaction,,,,,,,,,,,,death pope francis triggered period mourning across globe tens thousands people flocked vatican pay respects francis first latin american pope history died monday age funeral held saturday many world leaders attended ceremony took place mostly st peters square vatican authorities said people participated service nine days mourning cardinals age convene vatican pick francis‚Äô successor typically takes two three weeks pope chosen following death predecessor though can stretch slightly beyond cardinals struggle agree candidate
US YouTuber MrBeast sparks controversy by filming at Mexico archaeological sites,"Jimmy Donaldson, better known as MrBeast, is at the center of another controversy, and this time it directly involves Mexico.

MrBeast, who is by far the YouTuber with the most subscribers in the world (surpassing the second-place user by almost 100 million), published a video on May 10th in which he visited some of Mexicoís most important archaeological sites, including ChichÈn Itz· in the state of Yucat·n, home to the Temple of Kukulkan pyramid, known as El Castillo, one of the seven wonders of the modern world.

MrBeast also visited the archaeological sites of Calakmul in the state of Campeche and BalamcanchÈ in Yucat·n.

The video, which as of Wednesday afternoon has accumulated more than 55 million views, shows MrBeast and his team in the surroundings of Kukulkan, but also inside other archaeological structures, in cenotes and temples.

Some of these sites are not permanently accessible to the public, as the Mexican government has acknowledged.

What is the controversy surrounding MrBeast in Mexico?

The controversy centers on the fact that the YouTuber was allowed entry to sites considered sacred to Mexicoís pre-Hispanic cultures, which in many cases are restricted.

In one part of the video, MrBeast himself says: ìI canít believe the government is letting us do this. Itís truly crazy. Not even archaeologists are allowed in here.î

In response to the controversy, the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) ñ an agency attached to the Mexican governmentís Ministry of Culture ñ declared on Monday that both the visit and the recording were carried out through ìformal requests.î

These requests, however, were not made by MrBeast, but rather by ìthe federal Ministry of Tourism and the governments ofî Yucat·n and Campeche, the INAH indicated. In the description of his video, MrBeast claims that the publication is a ìcollaboration with the Mexican Ministry of Tourism.î

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Wednesday that there were permits for the ìbroadcast,î but asked the INAH to report ìunder what conditions this permit was granted.î

ìAnd if the permit was violated, then (it must be determined) what sanctions apply,î the president added.

Other points have also caused controversy, such as a drone shot that appears to be inside the temple at the top of El Castillo in ChichÈn Itz·. Regarding this, the INAH said that this did not occur and that the shot was in fact recorded outside the structure.

There are also scenes where MrBeast appears to descend to the archaeological sites by helicopter or where he holds a pre-Hispanic mask in his hands.

All of this, the INAH says, is either false or was edited after the recording: ìClearly, the video involves extensive audiovisual post-production work and alludes to events that did not occur, such as the fact that the producers never descended from a helicopter, spent the night inside the archaeological site, or possessed a pre-Hispanic mask, as the one presented is clearly a contemporary reproduction. All of these are false assertions that reflect the theatricality of the YouTuber in question.î

How easy is it to apply for permits? Is it true that not even archaeologists can enter, as MrBeast claims?

Exploring, filming, and broadcasting in Mexican archaeological sites is a restricted activity that few are allowed to do.

The INAH stated that, while institute personnel were supervising MrBeastís activities at all times, access was granted to an area that is not permanently accessible to the general public.

ìThe tours were conducted in publicly accessible areas without affecting visitor access. In the case of Calakmul, the substructure of the Structure II was also visited. Although it is not permanently open to the public, it does provide access by arranging a scheduled visit in advance and with justification, as is the case with tours conducted with the communities surrounding the archaeological site,î it said in its Monday statement.

Sheinbaum asked the INAH to provide information on the nature of the permit for the MrBeast video. Until it is announced, its scope and the points it covers are unknown.

However, by law, exploration of Mexicoís archaeological sites is permitted for a very small group of institutions.

In September 2024, the INAH responded to a request for citizen information requesting the ìrequirements and stepsî necessary to enter the Kukulkan pyramid at ChichÈn Itz·.

In this request, the director of the ChichÈn Itz· Archaeological Zone, JosÈ Francisco Javier Osorio LeÛn, mentions that ìin accordanceî with the provisions of the Federal Law on Archaeological, Artistic, and Historical Monuments and Zones, ìall types of material work to discover or explore archaeological monuments will only be carried out by the National Institute of Anthropology and History or by scientific institutions or those of recognized moral standing, with prior authorization.î

Likewise, Article 31 of this law states that the authorizations granted by the INAH must specify ìthe terms and conditions to which the work must be subject, as well as the obligations of those who carry it out.î

While the details of the permits for MrBeastís video are still unknown, the INAH stated that, although the YouTuberís video offers ìdistortedî information, its dissemination ìmay motivate interest among young audiences in Mexico and around the world to learn about our ancestral cultures and visit archaeological sites.î

Meanwhile, Federal Culture Secretary Claudia Curiel de Icaza spoke out against the activities carried out by MrBeast and his team at the archaeological sites.

ìThis isnít the first time this type of incident has happened, and itís been clarified. Of course we donít agree, and of course there will be appropriate sanctions because thatís not what these spaces are for,î Curiel de Icaza said Tuesday at a decorative and utilitarian art event.",5/14/2025,World,Uriel Blanco,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/14/americas/youtuber-mrbeast-controversy-mexico-archaeological-sites-intl-latam,,,,,,,,,,,,jimmy donaldson better known mrbeast center another controversy time directly involves mexico mrbeast far youtuber subscribers world surpassing secondplace user almost million published video may th visited mexico‚Äôs important archaeological sites including chich√©n itz√° state yucat√°n home temple kukulkan pyramid known el castillo one seven wonders modern world mrbeast also visited archaeological sites calakmul state campeche balamcanch√© yucat√°n video wednesday afternoon accumulated million views shows mrbeast team surroundings kukulkan also inside archaeological structures cenotes temples sites permanently accessible public mexican government acknowledged controversy surrounding mrbeast mexico controversy centers fact youtuber allowed entry sites considered sacred mexico‚Äôs prehispanic cultures many cases restricted one part video mrbeast says ‚Äúi can‚Äôt believe government letting us it‚Äôs truly crazy even archaeologists allowed here‚Äù response controversy national institute anthropology history inah ‚Äì agency attached mexican government‚Äôs ministry culture ‚Äì declared monday visit recording carried ‚Äúformal requests‚Äù requests however made mrbeast rather ‚Äúthe federal ministry tourism governments of‚Äù yucat√°n campeche inah indicated description video mrbeast claims publication ‚Äúcollaboration mexican ministry tourism‚Äù mexican president claudia sheinbaum said wednesday permits ‚Äúbroadcast‚Äù asked inah report ‚Äúunder conditions permit granted‚Äù ‚Äúand permit violated must determined sanctions apply‚Äù president added points also caused controversy drone shot appears inside temple top el castillo chich√©n itz√° regarding inah said occur shot fact recorded outside structure also scenes mrbeast appears descend archaeological sites helicopter holds prehispanic mask hands inah says either false edited recording ‚Äúclearly video involves extensive audiovisual postproduction work alludes events occur fact producers never descended helicopter spent night inside archaeological site possessed prehispanic mask one presented clearly contemporary reproduction false assertions reflect theatricality youtuber question‚Äù easy apply permits true even archaeologists can enter mrbeast claims exploring filming broadcasting mexican archaeological sites restricted activity allowed inah stated institute personnel supervising mrbeast‚Äôs activities times access granted area permanently accessible general public ‚Äúthe tours conducted publicly accessible areas without affecting visitor access case calakmul substructure structure ii also visited although permanently open public provide access arranging scheduled visit advance justification case tours conducted communities surrounding archaeological site‚Äù said monday statement sheinbaum asked inah provide information nature permit mrbeast video announced scope points covers unknown however law exploration mexico‚Äôs archaeological sites permitted small group institutions september inah responded request citizen information requesting ‚Äúrequirements steps‚Äù necessary enter kukulkan pyramid chich√©n itz√° request director chich√©n itz√° archaeological zone jos√© francisco javier osorio le√≥n mentions ‚Äúin accordance‚Äù provisions federal law archaeological artistic historical monuments zones ‚Äúall types material work discover explore archaeological monuments carried national institute anthropology history scientific institutions recognized moral standing prior authorization‚Äù likewise article law states authorizations granted inah must specify ‚Äúthe terms conditions work must subject well obligations carry out‚Äù details permits mrbeast‚Äôs video still unknown inah stated although youtuber‚Äôs video offers ‚Äúdistorted‚Äù information dissemination ‚Äúmay motivate interest among young audiences mexico around world learn ancestral cultures visit archaeological sites‚Äù meanwhile federal culture secretary claudia curiel de icaza spoke activities carried mrbeast team archaeological sites ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt first time type incident happened it‚Äôs clarified course don‚Äôt agree course appropriate sanctions that‚Äôs spaces for‚Äù curiel de icaza said tuesday decorative utilitarian art event
Toddler held in US after parents deportation has been returned to Venezuela,"A Venezuelan toddler who had been kept in US government custody after her parents were deported has been returned to Venezuela.

Maikelys Antonella Espinoza Bernal arrived at the SimÛn BolÌvar International Airport on Wednesday on a repatriation flight from the US.

Venezuelan First Lady Cilia Flores carried the 2-year-old in her arms as officials announced the girlís return to reporters gathered at the airport.

ìToday we have a great victory,î Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said.

Venezuela had been demanding that the United States return the girl for weeks, accusing US officials of kidnapping her.

The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) previously denied the allegations and reiterated after their reunion that it was trying to protect Maikelys from her parents, whom they accused without evidence of being part of criminal group Tren de Aragua (TDA), which the US deems a foreign terrorist organization.ìThe childís mother, Yorely Escarleth Bernal Inciarte, oversees recruitment of young women for drug smuggling and prostitution for Tren de Aragua. For the childís safety, she was not removed with the mother,î DHS Public Affairs Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement Wednesday.

Maikelysí mother has rejected that claim.

McLaughlin also alleged that the father was an involved in the sale of illicit drugs and sex trafficking, among other crimes, and is ìlocked up in CECOT,î referring to El Salvadorís maximum security mega-prison.

Maikelysí father believes he was accused of being a gang member because of his tattoos, but denies they have anything to do with gangs, according to his sworn declaration filed in court in early March.

DHS said the child was ìrepatriated to Venezuela pursuant to a court order,î after spending 302 days in the custody of Office of Refugee Resettlement.

In March, the US deported the father Maiker Espinoza-Escalona to a notorious prison in El Salvador, according to the Venezuelan government. The mother Yorelys Bernal was later deported on a flight to Venezuela without her daughter.On Wednesday, the girl was reunited with her mother and grandmother at the presidential palace in Caracas. State TV showed Bernal crying tears of joy as she held her daughter tightly in her arms.

President Nicol·s Maduro said Venezuelan officials had coordinated with lawyers and rights groups in the US to secure the girlís return.

ìI have to thank in fairness Ambassador Richard Grenell, special envoy of (US) President Donald Trump, for his efforts. And with Ambassador Richard Grenell, thank President Donald Trump, as well,î he said.

ìThere have been and there will be differences, but itís possible with Godís blessing to move forward.î

CNN has reached out to the US State Departmentís Venezuela Affairs Unit for more information.

A family separated
The toddler and her parents entered the US in May 2024 to seek asylum, according to a court document filed by legal advocacy groups.

After their arrival, the couple were put in immigration detention while their daughter was placed in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), the father had said in a sworn declaration.

In July, he received a deportation order under the Biden administration. Between October and March, the couple had weekly, in-person visits with their daughter, Espinoza stated.was sent to El Salvador. She was forced to return to her country on a flight without her 2-year-old child, Venezuela said.

The girl was kept in ORR custody, with DHS saying, ìWe will not allow this child to be abused and continue to be exposed to criminal activity that endangers her safety.î

In an email to CNN, ORR declined to provide details on the girlís time in its custody, citing ìprivacy and securityî concerns.

"Severe wildfires in Russiaôs Siberia region rage through 600,000 hectares of forest","Severe wildfires raging in a Siberian region of Russia have engulfed more than 600,000 hectares of forest, local authorities have warned.

In the Eastern Siberian territory of Zabaykalsky Krai, a federal-level state of emergencies has been in place since late April, Russian state news agency TASS reported.

Despite huge efforts to tackle wildfire outbreaks in the region, which borders Mongolia, 49 forest fires continue to burn, with a total area exceeding 629,000 hectares, the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations said Wednesday.On Tuesday, the Russian republic of Buryatia declared a regional-level state of emergency on Tuesday and closed all access to the forests, state news agency RIA Novosti reported.

Since mid-March, 174 forest fires have blazed in Buryatia, which also borders Mongolia, the regionís forestry agency said according to RIA Novosti. Of those fires, 90% were caused by careless human activity, the agency said.

More than 530 firefighting personnel have been deployed to tackle the blazes, with 22 active fires in the Buryatia region as of Tuesday.

Russiaís wildfire season started earlier than usual this year, with fires recorded as early as mid-March, compared to May in previous years.

Dryer, hotter weather in Russia, exacerbated by climate change, create tinder box conditions that can cause a small fire to spread rapidly.

"Israel targets Hamas leader Mohammed Sinwar in hospital strike in Gaza, sources say","Israel has targeted Hamas leader Mohammed Sinwar in a strike on a hospital in southern Gaza on Tuesday evening, according to a senior Israeli official and two sources familiar with the matter.

He became the militant groupís de facto leader after the Israeli military killed his brother, Yahya Sinwar, last October.

Tuesdayís strike killed 28 Palestinians and injured more than 50, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, which does not differentiate between military and civilian casualties.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it carried out a strike on the European hospital in Khan Younis, targeting ìHamas terrorists in a command and control centerî in underground infrastructure beneath the hospital. The IDF did not identify the target of the strike.

Multiple airstrikes hit the yard of the hospital, according to Dr. Saleh Al Hams, the head of nursing. Some people are buried under the rubble, he said, calling it ìa catastrophe.î Medical teams tried to move patients to safe units inside the hospital.A woman whose mother was being treated for lung cancer at the European hospital told the UK-based aid organization Medical Aid for Palestinians at the time of the strikes.

ìExplosions came from every direction, smoke, fire, rubble, sand everywhere. My mother collapsed on the floor. Shrapnel was flying all around usÖThe terror was beyond words. We hardly escaped death,î she said.

Marwan al-Hams, Director General of Field Hospitals at the Ministry of Health in Gaza, said the strikes had targeted the hospitalís inner courtyard and damaged sewage and water networks.

Marwan added that ambulances were unable to reach the emergency department, and a bulldozer brought in to clear rubble had been hit in another strike on Wednesday.

ìUntil this damage is repaired, we will be forced to close most of the hospitalís departments,î he said.

Muneer Alboursh, director general of the health ministry said that the world had turned a blind eye to the suffering of Palestinian civilians, saying that Gaza had become a ìzone where human life is treated as expendable.î

ìIf this footage came from Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Charite, or St. Thomas in London, the world would be on fire. Global leaders would descend. Investigations would launch within hours. But it was the European Hospital in Gaza ñ even its name couldnít protect it,î Alboursh said.

Gaza Civil Defense said that three people were killed while on their way to the hospital Wednesday.

Hamas rejected any Israeli claims about Sinwar, saying in a statement, ìThe Palestinian resistance alone, through its official platforms, is the authority authorized to confirm or deny what is published.î

On Tuesday night, the IDF said it intercepted two rockets fired from Gaza, in what appears to be the first launch from the besieged territory in a month. A third rocket landed in an open area. The military wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the attack, saying they fired at Israeli cities near Gaza.

A short time later, Israel issued evacuation warnings for the Jabalya refugee camp and nearby areas in northern Gaza, saying the IDF will ìstrike and operate in every location from which rockets are fired.î

ëThey took the hostage and thatís ití
The targeting of Sinwar comes one day after Hamas released Israeli American Edan Alexander in what was a goodwill gesture to the United States. The deal for a single hostageís release sidelined Israel, as Hamas communicated with the Trump administration.

Strikes in Gaza overnight killed at least 56 people, according to the director general of the Ministry of Health, with a nurse at a hospital in northern Gaza saying most were women and children.

Many of the dead from the overnight strikes were taken to the Indonesian Hospital. One man there, Mohammad al Arbid, said his cousinís family had been killed and asked why there had been no relief after the release on Monday of the Israeli-American hostage.

ìThey took the hostage and thatís it, no aid entered, there are no blood units in the hospital, there is no medication, there is a 5-year old boy crying inside. He only needs painkiller and there isnít (any) in the whole hospital, while the world is watching.îThe US expressed some optimism about negotiations set to take place in Qatar with President Donald Trump and his envoy Steve Witkoff in the Middle East. Before leaving Israel, Witkoff promised the families of the hostages that he ìwill be relentless on that pursuit.î

But with negotiations about to start in Doha ñ and with an Israeli team en route ñ the targeting of Sinwar means Israel has just attempted to kill Hamasí key decision maker needed to seal any potential agreement.February 2024, the IDF said they had located his office in western Khan Younis.

Former US Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro said Sinwar was likely an obstacle in negotiations. ìThere is little chance the war can end before he dies,î Shapiro, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, told CNN. ìHis removal could open the door for the release of all hostages and beginning to move toward a post-war future for Gaza without Hamas.îBut even if Sinwar is dead, it could take some time before Israel says officially that it has killed him, and even longer for Hamas to acknowledge his death. In mid-July, Israel said it had targeted Mohammed Deif in a strike on a designated humanitarian zone in southern Gaza. It took until August, more than two weeks later, for the IDF to declare it had indeed killed Deif. Hamas did not confirm his death until the end of January, nearly six months later.

Second Sinwar targeted
Before October, it was primarily Yahya Sinwar who was in the crosshairs of the Israeli military. Imprisoned for four life sentences in 1988, Yahya became fluent in Hebrew and said he spent his years studying his enemy. He was released in 2011 as part of the deal to free Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who had been held hostage by Hamas in Gaza for five years. His release has been attributed to the fact that his brother Mohammed was one of Shalitís kidnappers and insisted on Yahyaís inclusion in the deal.

Back in Gaza, Yahya quickly rose through the ranks of the militant organization, ultimately becoming its leader

After October 7, Yahya became Israelís most wanted man, and the IDF searched for him in the tiny coastal enclave. US officials believed Israel had come close to Yahya more than once, flushing him out of underground hiding places.

But Yahya moved undetected in the tunnels under Gaza, rarely coming above ground and avoiding detection by Israelís electronic surveillance. Ultimately, it was a routine Israeli patrol in Gaza which engaged in a firefight in Rafah in southern Gaza that discovered Yahyaís body in Rafah.

Daughter of crypto boss escapes Paris kidnap attempt in latest in series of attacks,"Passers-by helped to foil the attempted kidnapping by armed assailants of the daughter and grandson of a French cryptocurrency boss in Paris, in a brazen daytime attack that was caught on camera.

The incident prompted Paymium, the Crypto firm owned by the father of the woman targeted, to demand ìprotectionsî for companies in Franceís cryptocurrency sphere.

Tuesday morningís attack in Parisís 11th district is the latest in a string of violent incidents targeting figures in Franceís burgeoning crypto industry, including two attacks in recent months and at least five since 2023.

Four masked men attacked the daughter, her partner and their child in the French capital, police sources told French news agency Agence France-Presse (AFP).

Video footage shows three masked men jump out of a white van with branding from the Chronopost delivery company. The woman and her partner fight the attackers and loud screams for help are heard. Speaking to BFMTV, one witness said the assailants tried to ìpull a young woman by forceî into the waiting vehicle.

The woman can be seen grabbing a gun off one of the masked men and throwing it into the street. The weapon, which was later recovered from the scene, turned out to be a fake, sources told BFMTV.The screams attract the attention of passersby, who intervene, one of them armed with a fire extinguisher.

ìI saw passersby saying to stop. A man went out into the street with a fire extinguisher to try to make these people leave,î a witness told French broadcaster BFMTV.Eventually the assailants give up, the three men jump back into their van and the fourth suspect ñ the driver ñ makes a getaway.

Another woman who witnessed the scene told BFMTV, ìI went out into the street and saw this man lying on the ground with a pistol next to him, quite bloody.î

Once the attack was over, the victims were helped by people on the street. All three of them sustained light injuries and were treated in hospital, BFMTV reported. The woman, who according to the news outlet was five months pregnant, was treated for shock, while her partnerís face was covered in blood.

The woman in the footage is the daughter of the CEO and co-founder of Paymium, a French cryptocurrency exchange platform, according to AFP.

Franceís Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau announced Wednesday he would hold a meeting with cryptocurrency entrepreneurs to discuss security in light of the spate of attacks, according to AFP.

In the wake of the attack, Paymium released a statement calling for authorities to ìimmediately adopt measures to reinforce the protection of collaborators of companies in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.î The firm thanked Retailleau for agreeing to meet with Paymium, to ìfurther discuss all these matters.î

The company also said it was ìextremely saddenedî by Tuesdayís attack and extended its support to the families of the victims.

No arrests have yet been made in relation to the incident, CNN understands. The Paris prosecutorís office told CNN that it has opened an investigation into offenses of attempted arrest, abduction, kidnapping or arbitrary detention committed by an organized gang, aggravated violence and participation in a criminal association.

Chronopost said that it did not believe the van involved in the attempted kidnapping was from its company, but rather an attempt to mimic its branding. ìNoting the absence of vehicle theft within our company fleet and given the non-compliant markings visible on the images of the vehicle used, everything suggests at this stage that we are dealing with an impersonation of our brand,î the company wrote on X.

The attack on Tuesday follows the abductions of other cryptocurrency figures in France.

On May 1, the father of a cryptocurrency entrepreneur was kidnapped in Parisís 14th district and held for ransom. Police officers freed the victim, who was missing a finger, two days later on May 3. Five suspects were arrested in or near the house where the victim was being held, as well as two others the following day. Two of them were later cleared.

In January, David Balland, a co-founder of French crypto firm Ledger, had his hand mutilated after he and his wife were kidnapped from their home in central France. They were freed after a police operation. Part of the ransom of 10 million euros ($11.2 million) in cryptocurrency demanded by the kidnappers was paid, but ìalmost all of the cryptocurrency was traced, frozen, and seized,î BMFTV reported, citing the public prosecutor.",14-May-25,World,Sophie Tanno,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/14/europe/paris-kidnap-crypto-attack-intl,,,,,,,,,,,,passersby helped foil attempted kidnapping armed assailants daughter grandson french cryptocurrency boss paris brazen daytime attack caught camera incident prompted paymium crypto firm owned father woman targeted demand ‚Äúprotections‚Äù companies france‚Äôs cryptocurrency sphere tuesday morning‚Äôs attack paris‚Äôs th district latest string violent incidents targeting figures france‚Äôs burgeoning crypto industry including two attacks recent months least five since four masked men attacked daughter partner child french capital police sources told french news agency agence francepresse afp video footage shows three masked men jump white van branding chronopost delivery company woman partner fight attackers loud screams help heard speaking bfmtv one witness said assailants tried ‚Äúpull young woman force‚Äù waiting vehicle woman can seen grabbing gun one masked men throwing street weapon later recovered scene turned fake sources told bfmtvthe screams attract attention passersby intervene one armed fire extinguisher ‚Äúi saw passersby saying stop man went street fire extinguisher try make people leave‚Äù witness told french broadcaster bfmtveventually assailants give three men jump back van fourth suspect ‚Äì driver ‚Äì makes getaway another woman witnessed scene told bfmtv ‚Äúi went street saw man lying ground pistol next quite bloody‚Äù attack victims helped people street three sustained light injuries treated hospital bfmtv reported woman according news outlet five months pregnant treated shock partner‚Äôs face covered blood woman footage daughter ceo cofounder paymium french cryptocurrency exchange platform according afp france‚Äôs interior minister bruno retailleau announced wednesday hold meeting cryptocurrency entrepreneurs discuss security light spate attacks according afp wake attack paymium released statement calling authorities ‚Äúimmediately adopt measures reinforce protection collaborators companies cryptocurrency ecosystem‚Äù firm thanked retailleau agreeing meet paymium ‚Äúfurther discuss matters‚Äù company also said ‚Äúextremely saddened‚Äù tuesday‚Äôs attack extended support families victims arrests yet made relation incident cnn understands paris prosecutor‚Äôs office told cnn opened investigation offenses attempted arrest abduction kidnapping arbitrary detention committed organized gang aggravated violence participation criminal association chronopost said believe van involved attempted kidnapping company rather attempt mimic branding ‚Äúnoting absence vehicle theft within company fleet given noncompliant markings visible images vehicle used everything suggests stage dealing impersonation brand‚Äù company wrote x attack tuesday follows abductions cryptocurrency figures france may father cryptocurrency entrepreneur kidnapped paris‚Äôs th district held ransom police officers freed victim missing finger two days later may five suspects arrested near house victim held well two others following day two later cleared january david balland cofounder french crypto firm ledger hand mutilated wife kidnapped home central france freed police operation part ransom million euros million cryptocurrency demanded kidnappers paid ‚Äúalmost cryptocurrency traced frozen seized‚Äù bmftv reported citing public prosecutor
Zelensky insists he will only join Ukraine-Russia talks in Turkey this week if Putin is present,"Ukraineís President Volodymyr Zelensky raised the stakes ahead of a potential meeting with Vladimir Putin in Turkey by saying he wouldnít hold talks with any Russian representative other than the president himself.

Zelensky said he would travel to Turkey after US President Donald Trump urged him to meet Putin. The Russian leader had suggested direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv in the country on Thursday in response to the ceasefire-or-sanctions ultimatum given to Moscow by Kyivís European allies on Saturday.

Asked by CNN about the goals of the possible meeting ñ one Putin has not yet agreed to attend despite proposing it himself ñ Zelensky said anything other than a ceasefire agreement would be a failure.Zelensky said he would not consider meeting any other Russian representatives because ìeverything in Russia dependsî on Putin.

ìSo I said that on (Thursday) I will go to Turkey and Iím ready to meet Putin and an end to the war was through direct talks with him,î Zelensky told reporters at a news conference.

Russia hopes to deal directly with Ukraine in Istanbul, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Russian state news agency TASS on Tuesday.

ìOur representatives are getting ready for this meeting,î the news agency quoted him as saying.

Although it is not clear whether the US or Russian presidents will show up in Istanbul, Trump has confirmed that Secretary of State Marco Rubio will attend the talks.

The uncertainty over Thursdayís talks comes amid growing international pressure on Moscow to agree to the US-backed plan for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron warned Tuesday that if Russia doesnít comply with those demands, sanctions ñ including on financial services ñ could be imposed ìin the coming days in close liaison with the United States.î

Going some way to make good on this threat, the European Union on Wednesday unveiled a fresh round of sanctions against Moscowís ìshadow fleetî of oil tankers, used by the Kremlin to circumvent previous Western sanctions against Russian oil exports.

Further sanctions could be imposed by France and Ukraineís other major European allies if Moscow does not agree to a ceasefire at the planned talks in Turkey.

Two European diplomatic sources told CNN they have low expectations for Thursday and doubt Putin will actually show up.

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a US-based conflict monitor, said on Monday that Russian officials already appeared to be setting conditions for Putin to reject the meeting, quoting several key aides as questioning Zelenskyís intentions and calling the proposed meeting ìpure spectacle.îZelensky also said he offered Trump the option of joining the meeting, saying the presence of the US president would ìgive additional impulse for Putin to fly in.î

He said earlier that his country ìwould appreciateî Trumpís attendance, and said he supported the US presidentís call for direct talks between himself and Putin.

Top Trump administration officials plan to be in Turkey this week, but the presidentís possible attendance remains an open question that will largely be dictated by whether his Russian counterpart attends, according to a senior administration official.

He is visiting the Gulf this week, making stops in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, for his first major overseas trip since the start of his second term. He said he could detour to Turkey ìif I thought it would be helpful.î

ìI think you may have a good result out of the Thursday meeting in Turkey between Russia and Ukraine,î Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday. ìI donít know where Iím going to be on Thursday, Iíve got so many meetings, but I was thinking about actually flying over there. Thereís a possibility of it, I guess, if I think things can happen.î

Whether Trump attends or not, US envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg and Trumpís foreign envoy Steve Witkoff both plan to be in Istanbul for the talks, the senior administration official said. Another source familiar with the plans also confirmed Witkoffís attendance. As of Tuesday, the plan was for the US officials to observe the Turkish-facilitated talks between the Ukrainians and Russians.

Front line largely static
For months, Ukraine and its allies tried to convince the Trump administration that Putin acts in bad faith, and have said Russiaís agreeing to a ceasefire could function as a test of whether it is serious about achieving the peace the US president has long demanded.

Ukraineís major European allies had given Russia an ultimatum on Saturday: agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine or face ìmassiveî new sanctions.

Putin ignored the ultimatum, proposing the talks instead. Direct talks between the leaders of Russia and Ukraine have not happened since the early weeks of Moscowís unprovoked full-scale invasion in 2022.

Speaking on Tuesday, Zelensky said he expects the US and Europe to impose new ìstrongî sanctions on Russia if Moscow doesnít sign up to the ceasefire on Thursday.

Meanwhile, the situation on the ground in eastern Ukraine doesnít seem to suggest Russia is preparing for a ceasefire. Russian troops have been inching forward in several key areas along the front line and launching near-daily drone and missile attacks against Ukrainian cities. Still, the front line in eastern Ukraine has not moved dramatically in recent months, with neither side able to break through.

The ISW said on Monday that Russia has reportedly deployed a largely ceremonial regiment of the Federal Security Service (FSB) to the front line, which the ISW said was ìlikely in an effort to generate fear of more rapid future Russian advances.î",14-May-25,World,"Jessie Yeung, Ivana Kottasov√É¬°, Nick Paton Walsh, Andrew Carey",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/12/europe/trump-russia-ukraine-talks-turkey-intl-hnk,,,,,,,,,,,,ukraine‚Äôs president volodymyr zelensky raised stakes ahead potential meeting vladimir putin turkey saying wouldn‚Äôt hold talks russian representative president zelensky said travel turkey us president donald trump urged meet putin russian leader suggested direct talks moscow kyiv country thursday response ceasefireorsanctions ultimatum given moscow kyiv‚Äôs european allies saturday asked cnn goals possible meeting ‚Äì one putin yet agreed attend despite proposing ‚Äì zelensky said anything ceasefire agreement failurezelensky said consider meeting russian representatives ‚Äúeverything russia depends‚Äù putin ‚Äúso said thursday go turkey i‚Äôm ready meet putin end war direct talks him‚Äù zelensky told reporters news conference russia hopes deal directly ukraine istanbul russian deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov told russian state news agency tass tuesday ‚Äúour representatives getting ready meeting‚Äù news agency quoted saying although clear whether us russian presidents show istanbul trump confirmed secretary state marco rubio attend talks uncertainty thursday‚Äôs talks comes amid growing international pressure moscow agree usbacked plan day ceasefire ukraine french president emmanuel macron warned tuesday russia doesn‚Äôt comply demands sanctions ‚Äì including financial services ‚Äì imposed ‚Äúin coming days close liaison united states‚Äù going way make good threat european union wednesday unveiled fresh round sanctions moscow‚Äôs ‚Äúshadow fleet‚Äù oil tankers used kremlin circumvent previous western sanctions russian oil exports sanctions imposed france ukraine‚Äôs major european allies moscow agree ceasefire planned talks turkey two european diplomatic sources told cnn low expectations thursday doubt putin actually show institute study war isw usbased conflict monitor said monday russian officials already appeared setting conditions putin reject meeting quoting several key aides questioning zelensky‚Äôs intentions calling proposed meeting ‚Äúpure spectacle‚Äùzelensky also said offered trump option joining meeting saying presence us president ‚Äúgive additional impulse putin fly in‚Äù said earlier country ‚Äúwould appreciate‚Äù trump‚Äôs attendance said supported us president‚Äôs call direct talks putin top trump administration officials plan turkey week president‚Äôs possible attendance remains open question largely dictated whether russian counterpart attends according senior administration official visiting gulf week making stops saudi arabia united arab emirates qatar first major overseas trip since start second term said detour turkey ‚Äúif thought helpful‚Äù ‚Äúi think may good result thursday meeting turkey russia ukraine‚Äù trump told reporters white house monday ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know i‚Äôm going thursday i‚Äôve got many meetings thinking actually flying there‚Äôs possibility guess think things can happen‚Äù whether trump attends us envoy ukraine keith kellogg trump‚Äôs foreign envoy steve witkoff plan istanbul talks senior administration official said another source familiar plans also confirmed witkoff‚Äôs attendance tuesday plan us officials observe turkishfacilitated talks ukrainians russians front line largely static months ukraine allies tried convince trump administration putin acts bad faith said russia‚Äôs agreeing ceasefire function test whether serious achieving peace us president long demanded ukraine‚Äôs major european allies given russia ultimatum saturday agree unconditional day ceasefire ukraine face ‚Äúmassive‚Äù new sanctions putin ignored ultimatum proposing talks instead direct talks leaders russia ukraine happened since early weeks moscow‚Äôs unprovoked fullscale invasion speaking tuesday zelensky said expects us europe impose new ‚Äústrong‚Äù sanctions russia moscow doesn‚Äôt sign ceasefire thursday meanwhile situation ground eastern ukraine doesn‚Äôt seem suggest russia preparing ceasefire russian troops inching forward several key areas along front line launching neardaily drone missile attacks ukrainian cities still front line eastern ukraine moved dramatically recent months neither side able break isw said monday russia reportedly deployed largely ceremonial regiment federal security service fsb front line isw said ‚Äúlikely effort generate fear rapid future russian advances‚Äù

"Inside the Bayesian final moments: extreme winds sank superyacht, interim report finds","Sudden, hurricane-force winds toppled the luxury Bayesian superyacht that sank off the coast of Sicily last August, according to an interim report into the disaster, which found the boat had ìvulnerabilitiesî to extreme wind which were not known to the owner or crew.

The 184-foot sailing boat owned by British tech tycoon Mike Lynch was anchored about a half mile from the port of Porticello on the Italian islandís northern coast when it sank, killing seven people, including Lynch and his 18-year-old daughter Hannah.

Initial efforts to recover the remains of the yacht have also proved deadly. A diver involved in the operations died in an accident on Friday, May 9. The diver has been confirmed as Rob Cornelis Maria Huijben Uiben, a 39-year-old Dutch national who worked for TMC, the company running the recovery.The exact cause of his death remains unclear, although the public prosecutorís office told CNN that there was evidence his body had been pierced with a metal shard.

Work to recover the superyacht was paused in the wake of his death, but restarted again on Thursday morning. However, an orange weather warning for rain, thunderstorms and strong winds was in place in the region when the operation resumed.On the evening of August 13 when Bayesianís guests and some of its crew retired for the night, the seas were calm and the winds were light, but thunderstorms were forecast, the report said.

Bayesianís skipper, James Cutfield, told the overnight watchkeepers to wake him if the wind speed increased above 23 mph or if the boat started dragging anchor, the report said.

At around 3 a.m., one of the watchkeepers noticed storm clouds and lightning seemed to be getting closer, though the wind was blowing at around 9 mph from the west.

An hour later, the wind picked up to 34 mph. Around 3:55 a.m., the watchkeeper filmed a video of the advancing storm and posted it to social media, according to the report, before closing the cockpit windows and forward hatches to protect the yachtís interior from rain.

Eyewitnesses described furious gales and hurricane-like winds that left an avalanche of debris near the pier.At 3:57 a.m., the yacht started dragging its anchor, and the watchkeeper woke the skipper and other crewmembers, the report said. Some of the guests were also woken by the storm. Lynch made his way to the boatís flybridge to see if the taxis arranged for 8 a.m. that morning would have to be canceled because of the storm. The yachtís chef began stowing cutlery, pots and pans.

Then, the wind suddenly increased to more than 80 mph, and at around 4:06 a.m. the yacht ìviolently heeled overî to a 90-degree angle in less than 15 seconds, sending people, furniture and other loose items flying across the deck, the report said.

ìThere was no indication of flooding inside Bayesian until water came in over the starboard rails and, within seconds, entered the internal spaces down the stairwells,î the report said.

Guests and crew scrambled to escape the sinking ship, with two guests using furniture drawers as a ladder to escape their cabin, according to the report.

The survivors treaded water and used cushions from the boat as flotation devices before the boatís chief officer was able to detach and inflate a life raft, the report said.

Responding to a flare from the life raft, the skipper of a nearby ship rescued the survivors before calling the local coast guard, the report said.Seven people died in the accident, including the yachtís chef Recaldo Thomas, Morgan Stanley International director Jonathan Bloomer, prominent American lawyer Chris Morvillo, and both of their wives ñ Judy Bloomer and Neda Morvillo. Cutfield and 14 other people survived the sinking, including Lynchís wife, Angela Bacares.

Winds of 73 mph were enough to knock the Bayesian beyond the point of no recovery, the investigation found. It also said it is possible Bayesian could have been vulnerable to lighter winds.

ìThese vulnerabilities (when in the motoring condition with sails lowered, the centreboard raised and 10% consumables on board) were not identified in the stability information book carried on board,î the report said. ìConsequently, these vulnerabilities were also unknown to either the owner or the crew of Bayesian.î

"Russia and Ukraine are due to meet. But with Putin a no-show, confusion reigns. Here's what we know","Days of speculation that Ukraineís President Volodymyr Zelensky could meet with Russiaís President Vladimir Putin in Turkey have ended with the Kremlin pouring cold water on the idea, confirming that the Russian leader had decided not to show up for talks he himself suggested.

The possibility of direct talks between Russia and Ukraine was not entirely off the table as of Thursday morning, however, with lower-level delegations from both countries known to be in Turkey.

A direct meeting would be a major development ñ the two sides are not known to have met directly since soon after Moscow launched its unprovoked, full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

And while the talks are unlikely to yield immediate results, and almost certainly wonít bring the elusive ìdealî US President Donald Trump has been promising since his return to the White House, they could still have a major impact on the future of the war ñ if Trump decides that Putinís no-show is a sign of his unwillingness to end the war.

Adding to the general uncertainty over how a day of high-stakes diplomacy might unfold, Zelensky is sitting down with Turkeyís President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the capital, Ankara, while US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is in southern Turkey for an informal meeting of NATO foreign ministers.How did we get to this point?
The talks were first proposed by Putin in response to the ceasefire-or-sanctions ultimatum given to Moscow by Ukraineís European allies on Saturday, when the leaders of Germany, France, Poland and the United Kingdom demanded that Russia accept a 30-day ceasefire proposal or face a new round of ìmassiveî sanctions.

Putin ignored the ultimatum, proposing instead ìdirect talksî between Russia and Ukraine.

This was likely a delaying tactic by Putin ñ something he has successfully deployed several times in the past. But it appears to have backfired.

The Europeans and Ukraine initially said there could be no talks before a ceasefire is agreed, but that quickly changed when Trump got involved. In a post on social media, he publicly urged Zelensky to ìHAVE THE MEETING, NOW!!!îTrump, currently on a Middle East tour, added to the pressure by suggesting he might go as well, ìif itís helpful.î That idea was endorsed by Zelensky, who said Ukraine would be ìgratefulî for Trumpís presence. Trump also told CNN on Wednesday that Putin would ìlike me to be there.î

But two White House officials told CNN that Trump was not planning to travel to Turkey. ìI was thinking about going,î Trump said Thursday in Qatar, but stressed it wasnít a firm plan. He kept the option open, though, adding: ìIf something happened, Iíd go on Friday if it was appropriate.î

By putting the ball in Putinís court, Zelensky placed the Russian leader under pressure.

If Putin had decided to show up, he would have undermined his own narrative that Zelensky and his government are illegitimate.

But by staying at home, Putin gave Zelensky an opportunity to point out, once again, that Russia is not serious about peace.

This message is aimed squarely at Trump. Kyiv and its European allies have long said they donít believe Putin is seriously interested in negotiating peace.

Trump has previously repeatedly expressed his belief in the opposite, although he began expressing his doubts in recent weeks, questioning whether Putin wants peace after speaking to Zelensky on the sidelines of Pope Francisí funeral in the Vatican last month.

Highlighting this is likely the key reason why Zelensky suggested a personal meeting with Putin, who, according to Ukrainian and Western intelligence services, had previously ordered his assassination.What could be on the table?
The two sides are so far apart that it is unclear what the talks ñ if they indeed happen ñ would be about.

Zelensky said on Tuesday that anything other than an agreement on an unconditional ceasefire would be a failure.

Putin, meanwhile, said that while Russia does not rule out that ìduring these talks there will be a possibility to arrange some kind of new truce, a new ceasefire,î the talks will aim to eliminate the ìroot causesî of the conflict.

The ìroot causesî he cites include long-held Russian grievances that include the existence of Ukraine ñ formerly part of the Soviet Union ñ as a sovereign state, and NATOís eastward expansion since the end of the Cold War.

Neither is negotiable for Ukraine or its allies.

What happened the last time Ukraine and Russia talked?
The last known direct talks between Kyiv and Moscow took place in Turkey and Belarus in the spring of 2022 ñ when it became clear that Putinís initial plan to take over the whole of Ukraine and install a new puppet government in Kyiv within a few days had gone catastrophically wrong.If not Putin, who is coming?
Shortly after Zelensky challenged the Russian leader to travel to Turkey, the Kremlin started to lay the groundwork for the possibility that Putin might not attend.

The Kremlin late Wednesday said Vladimir Medinsky, Putinís senior aide and member of the countryís Supreme Council bureau, would lead a delegation of Kremlin insiders. The aide previously headed Russiaís delegation in 2022 when Kyiv and Moscow had their last known direct talks.

This is in line with Putinís call for the talks to pick up where the meeting in 2022 stopped ñ an option that would be unpalatable to the Ukrainians since the demands Russia was making back then would amount to a capitulation by Kyiv.

The stakes are higher this time though, as both Trump and Ukraineís European allies have said they will impose more sanctions on Moscow if it doesnít agree to the ceasefire.

Itís not yet clear whether Ukraine will send a delegation to Istanbul to meet with the Russian negotiators and who might be part of it.

What else do we know about the talks?
Not much. The Turkish government said earlier this week that it was prepared to provide ìall kinds of support, including mediation and hosting negotiations, to achieve peaceî in Ukraine.

Turkey has played the role of the bridge between Moscow and Kyiv in the past, most notably when it brokered the Black Sea Grain Initiative which guarantees the safe passage of Ukrainian ships carrying food exports ñ a rare diplomatic success in the brutal conflict. Russia withdrew from the pact in 2023.

As a NATO member, Turkey is invested in the conflict, but it is also seen as more amenable to Russia, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan previously hailing his ìspecial relationshipî with Putin.

Trumpís special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, and his foreign envoy Steve Witkoff both plan to be in Istanbul this week, a senior Trump administration official said on Tuesday, a statement confirmed by another source familiar with the plans.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is also in Turkey, attending the informal meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Antalya.

Rubio, Kellogg and Witkoff all took part in some of the previous rounds of talks in Saudi Arabia, in which they acted as intermediaries, meeting separately with the Russian delegation and then, a few days later, with the Ukrainians.

This time, the possibility that the two delegations might meet face to face is significant ñ even if their goal is more about satisfying Trump than reaching an actual deal.

Man wrongfully jailed for nearly four decades weeps as UK court overturns murder conviction,"A man who spent nearly four decades in a British prison in the killing of a barmaid said he was not angry or bitter Tuesday as his murder conviction was overturned and he was released after being exonerated by DNA evidence.

Peter Sullivan put his hand over his mouth and wept as the Court of Appeal in London quashed his conviction and ordered his freedom after he had spent years fighting to prove his innocence.

Sullivan, who watched the hearing by video from Wakefield prison in northern England, said through his lawyer that he was not resentful and was anxious to see his loved ones.

ìAs god is my witness, it is said the truth shall take you free,î attorney Sarah Myatt read from a statement outside court. ìIt is unfortunate that it does not give a timescale as we advance towards resolving the wrongs done to me. I am not angry, I am not bitter.î

He was the longest-serving victim of a wrongful conviction in the U.K., Myatt said.

Sullivan, 68, was convicted in 1987 of killing Diane Sindall in Bebington, near Liverpool in northwest England. He was behind bars for 38 years.Sindall, 21, a florist who was engaged to be married, was returning home from a part-time job at a pub on a Friday night in August 1986 when her van ran out of fuel, police said. She was last seen walking along the road after midnight.

Her body was found about 12 hours later in an alley. She had been sexually assaulted and badly beaten.

Sexual fluid found on Sindallís body could not be scientifically analyzed until recently. A test in 2024 revealed it wasnít Sullivan, defense attorney Jason Pitter said.

ìThe prosecution case is that it was one person. It was one person who carried out a sexual assault on the victim,î Pitter said. ìThe evidence here is now that one person was not the defendant.î

Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson did not challenge the appeal and said that if the DNA evidence had been available at the time of the investigation it was inconceivable that Sullivan would have been prosecuted.

Merseyside Police said it reopened the investigation as the appeal was underway and was ìcommitted to doing everythingî to find the killer.

The Criminal Cases Review Commission, which examines possible wrongful convictions, declined to refer Sullivanís case to the appeals court in 2008 because it said testing at the time was unlikely to produce a DNA profile.A commission spokesperson said that while it made the correct decision based on the evidence at the time, it regretted not identifying the potential miscarriage of justice in its first review.

Sullivan appealed in 2019 without the CCRCís help and the court turned down his bid in 2021.

But the commission took up the case later that year and was able to use scientific techniques that hadnít been available during the earlier review to find the DNA that set Sullivan free.ìIn the light of that evidence, it is impossible to regard the appellantís conviction as safe,î Justice Timothy Holroyde said.

Police said the DNA found in the subsequent investigation does not match anyone in a national database. Theyíve ruled out as suspects Sindallís fiancÈ, members of her family and more than 260 men who have been screened since they reopened the investigation.

Sullivanís sister, Kim Smith, reflected outside the court on the toll the case had taken on two families.

ìWe lost Peter for 39 years and at the end of the day itís not just us,î Smith said. ìPeter hasnít won and neither has the Sindall family. Theyíve lost their daughter, they are not going to get her back. Weíve got Peter back and now weíve got to try and build a life around him again.î",13-May-25,World,Story by the Associated Press,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/13/uk/uk-peter-sullivan-conviction-overturned-intl-hnk,,,,,,,,,,,,man spent nearly four decades british prison killing barmaid said angry bitter tuesday murder conviction overturned released exonerated dna evidence peter sullivan put hand mouth wept court appeal london quashed conviction ordered freedom spent years fighting prove innocence sullivan watched hearing video wakefield prison northern england said lawyer resentful anxious see loved ones ‚Äúas god witness said truth shall take free‚Äù attorney sarah myatt read statement outside court ‚Äúit unfortunate give timescale advance towards resolving wrongs done angry bitter‚Äù longestserving victim wrongful conviction uk myatt said sullivan convicted killing diane sindall bebington near liverpool northwest england behind bars yearssindall florist engaged married returning home parttime job pub friday night august van ran fuel police said last seen walking along road midnight body found hours later alley sexually assaulted badly beaten sexual fluid found sindall‚Äôs body scientifically analyzed recently test revealed wasn‚Äôt sullivan defense attorney jason pitter said ‚Äúthe prosecution case one person one person carried sexual assault victim‚Äù pitter said ‚Äúthe evidence now one person defendant‚Äù prosecutor duncan atkinson challenge appeal said dna evidence available time investigation inconceivable sullivan prosecuted merseyside police said reopened investigation appeal underway ‚Äúcommitted everything‚Äù find killer criminal cases review commission examines possible wrongful convictions declined refer sullivan‚Äôs case appeals court said testing time unlikely produce dna profilea commission spokesperson said made correct decision based evidence time regretted identifying potential miscarriage justice first review sullivan appealed without ccrc‚Äôs help court turned bid commission took case later year able use scientific techniques hadn‚Äôt available earlier review find dna set sullivan free‚Äúin light evidence impossible regard appellant‚Äôs conviction safe‚Äù justice timothy holroyde said police said dna found subsequent investigation match anyone national database they‚Äôve ruled suspects sindall‚Äôs fianc√© members family men screened since reopened investigation sullivan‚Äôs sister kim smith reflected outside court toll case taken two families ‚Äúwe lost peter years end day it‚Äôs just us‚Äù smith said ‚Äúpeter hasn‚Äôt won neither sindall family they‚Äôve lost daughter going get back we‚Äôve got peter back now we‚Äôve got try build life around again‚Äù
French actor rard Depardieu found guilty of sexual assault,"A court in Paris on Tuesday found French actor GÈrard Depardieu guilty of sexually assaulting two women on a film set in 2021 and handed him an 18-month suspended prison sentence, in a fall from grace for a towering figure of French cinema.

In one of the highest-profile #MeToo cases to come before judges in France, Depardieu repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and his lawyer said he would appeal the courtís decision.

Depardieu, 76, was a towering figure in French cinema, starring in more than 200 films over five decades, including ìGreen Card,î ìThe Last Metroî and ìCyrano de Bergerac.î

His trial marked a moment of reckoning for the #MeToo protest movement over sexual violence, which has failed to gain the same traction in France as in the United States, although there are signs that social attitudes are changing.

One of the two plaintiffs, Amelie K, a set decorator now aged 54, told the court the actor had groped her all over her body as he trapped her between his legs and made explicit sexual comments on set in 2021.

ìI was terrified, he was laughing,î she recounted.

Depardieu, who denied sexual assault, had argued before the court that he did not consider placing a hand on a personís buttocks sexual assault and that some women were too easily shocked.

Handing down his sentence, the presiding judge, Thierry Donard, said of Depardieu: ìHe does not seem to have grasped either the concept of consent or the deleterious and traumatic consequences of his behaviour towards the women he assaulted.î

He ordered Depardieu, who was not in court for the verdict, to be put on a list of sex offenders.

#MeToo reckoning
Depardieu has figured prominently in the debate over the #MeToo movement in France, as he faced a growing number of sexual assault allegations that put a spotlight on how women are treated in the movie industry.

Prosecutors say he should face trial in a separate rape investigation, following allegations brought by actress Charlotte Arnould, 29, who said she could not bear remaining silent any longer.

More than a dozen women have accused Depardieu of sexual violence, though not all have filed complaints.

Depardieu has consistently denied wrongdoing. ìNever, absolutely never, have I abused a woman,î he wrote in an open letter in the daily Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023.

The Depardieu trial laid bare a generational divide in France over sexism.

Earlier during the investigation, a group of 50 French stars, including Carla Bruni, wife of former President Nicolas Sarkozy, denounced what they called the ìlynchingî of Depardieu.

Brigitte Bardot, 90, told BFM TV this week that ìthose who have talent and grope a girl get thrown into the gutter.î

Womenís rights campaigners say they have seen a shift in attitudes in France - notably following the case of Gisele Pelicot whose ex-husband was convicted last year of inviting dozens of men to rape her after drugging her unconscious.

ìItís truly a victory and a step forward. Weíre making progress,î Amelie K. told reporters after the verdict."," May 13, 2025",World,Julien De Rosa,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/13/europe/gerard-depardieu-sexual-assault-trial-intl,,,,,,,,,,,,court paris tuesday found french actor g√©rard depardieu guilty sexually assaulting two women film set handed month suspended prison sentence fall grace towering figure french cinema one highestprofile metoo cases come judges france depardieu repeatedly denied wrongdoing lawyer said appeal court‚Äôs decision depardieu towering figure french cinema starring films five decades including ‚Äúgreen card‚Äù ‚Äúthe last metro‚Äù ‚Äúcyrano de bergerac‚Äù trial marked moment reckoning metoo protest movement sexual violence failed gain traction france united states although signs social attitudes changing one two plaintiffs amelie k set decorator now aged told court actor groped body trapped legs made explicit sexual comments set ‚Äúi terrified laughing‚Äù recounted depardieu denied sexual assault argued court consider placing hand person‚Äôs buttocks sexual assault women easily shocked handing sentence presiding judge thierry donard said depardieu ‚Äúhe seem grasped either concept consent deleterious traumatic consequences behaviour towards women assaulted‚Äù ordered depardieu court verdict put list sex offenders metoo reckoning depardieu figured prominently debate metoo movement france faced growing number sexual assault allegations put spotlight women treated movie industry prosecutors say face trial separate rape investigation following allegations brought actress charlotte arnould said bear remaining silent longer dozen women accused depardieu sexual violence though filed complaints depardieu consistently denied wrongdoing ‚Äúnever absolutely never abused woman‚Äù wrote open letter daily le figaro newspaper october depardieu trial laid bare generational divide france sexism earlier investigation group french stars including carla bruni wife former president nicolas sarkozy denounced called ‚Äúlynching‚Äù depardieu brigitte bardot told bfm tv week ‚Äúthose talent grope girl get thrown gutter‚Äù women‚Äôs rights campaigners say seen shift attitudes france notably following case gisele pelicot whose exhusband convicted last year inviting dozens men rape drugging unconscious ‚Äúit‚Äôs truly victory step forward we‚Äôre making progress‚Äù amelie k told reporters verdict
UK police arrest man for arson after fire at PM Starmer house,"British police said on Tuesday they had arrested a 21-year-old man on suspicion of arson after counter-terrorism officers launched an investigation into three fires, including one at Prime Minister Keir Starmerís private home.

Police were called to reports of a fire in the early hours of Monday morning at the property in Kentish Town in north London, the area that Starmer represents in parliament.

Nobody was injured but damage was caused to the propertyís entrance, police said.The man was arrested in the early hours of Tuesday on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life in connection with the fire and two further incidents, police said. He remains in custody, they added.

Police are investigating whether a fire at the entrance of a property in nearby Islington on Sunday and a vehicle fire in Kentish Town on Thursday are linked to the incident on Monday.

A BBC report said the Islington property was also connected to the prime minister.Starmer lived in the terraced house on a back street with his wife and two children before he moved into Number 10 Downing Street when he became prime minister last July.

Officers from Londonís Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command were leading the investigation due to the propertyís connections with a high-profile public figure, police said.

Zelensky challenges Putin offer to meet after Russia ignores ceasefire demand,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he is prepared to meet Vladimir Putin this week, shortly after US President Donald Trump urged him to ìimmediatelyî accept the Russian leaderís offer to hold peace talks in Turkey.

After meeting in Kyiv on Saturday, Ukraineís major European allies gave Russia an ultimatum: agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine by Monday or face ìmassiveî new sanctions. Trump supported the initiative, Germanyís new chancellor Friedrich Merz said.

In a late-night address, Putin did not acknowledge the ultimatum. Ignoring the ceasefire offer, he instead proposed holding ìdirect talksî with Ukraine in Turkey on Thursday ñ something not seen since the early weeks of Moscowís full-scale invasion in 2022.

Ukraineís allies spent Sunday stressing that there could be no further talks before Putin agrees to an unconditional ceasefire. But Trump undermined the efforts to put pressure on Putin, saying that Ukraine should ìimmediatelyî agree to meet with Russian officials on Thursday.

ìHAVE THE MEETING, NOW!!!î Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Within an hour, Zelensky said he was prepared to meet with Putin this week, in what would be the leadersí first meeting since Russia launched its war.

ìI will be waiting for Putin in T¸rkiye on Thursday. Personally. I hope that this time the Russians will not look for excuses,î Zelensky said Sunday on X.

Although Zelensky said a ìfull and lasting ceasefireî from Monday would provide ìthe necessary basis for diplomacy,î he did not specify that this would be a precondition for attending the talks.

Whereas Putin on Saturday faced a joint call from Europe and the US to accept a ceasefire by Mondayís deadline, his counteroffer of ìdirectî talks had by Sunday relieved much of the pressure on Moscow and shifted the focus to the potential talks this week. European leaders have not yet said whether they will press ahead with the threatened additional sanctions on Russia if a ceasefire is not in place by Monday.
Before Trumpís comment, Zelensky had responded with trepidation to Putinís offer, calling it a ìpositive sign,î but stressing that Kyiv first expects Moscow to agree to the new ceasefire proposal. Ukraineís European allies more forcefully dismissed Putinís offer, saying there could be no new talks before a ceasefire.

Merz, Germanyís new chancellor, said talks ìcannot begin until weapons fall silent.î Polandís Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the world was still waiting on Russiaís ìunivocal decision on an immediate and unconditional ceasefire.î French President Emmanuel Macron said Putinís counter-offer was ìnot enough.î

Keith Kellogg, the Trump administrationís special envoy to Ukraine, whose influence has dwindled since January, echoed the Europeansí claims, saying a ceasefire must come before talks, ìnot the other way round.î

But Trump abandoned his earlier demand that Russia agree to a 30-day ceasefire, instead calling on Ukraine to attend the peace talks without preconditions.

For months, Ukraine and its allies tried to convince the Trump administration that Putin acts in bad faith, and have said Russiaís agreeing to a ceasefire could function as a test of whether it is serious about achieving the peace the US president has long demanded.

But Putinís offer for direct talks ñ made in a rare televised address at 1 a.m. local time Sunday ñ was a gamble to distract from the fact that Russia is likely to snub Mondayís ceasefire deadline, analysts said.

Putinís offer put Zelensky under ìhuge pressureî to agree to hold talks in Turkey, Sergey Radchenko, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, told CNN.

ìWhy? Because otherwise, heíll have to deal with Trump, whoís going to say, ëWhy are you undermining my peace initiative here? Why canít you just talk?íî

Turkey ëreadyí to host talks
Already setting the stage for talks, Putin spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday. The Kremlin said Erdogan ìfully supportedî Putinís proposal for peace talks and had offered Istanbul as a venue.

On Monday, Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov held a phone call with his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan to discuss the start of direct negotiations, according to statements from both sides.

Although Ankara confirmed Turkey is ready to host the negotiations, a statement from the countryís presidency suggested that it agreed with Ukraineís allies that a ceasefire must come before talks.ìNoting that a window of opportunity to achieve peace has opened, President Erdo?an said that a comprehensive ceasefire would create the necessary environment for peace talks,î the statement read. It did not say whether Turkey would decline to host the talks if Russia refused the ceasefire offer.

The White House said Secretary of State Marco Rubio will visit Turkey from Wednesday to Friday, to attend an informal meeting of NATO foreign ministers and discuss ìending the Russia-Ukraine war,î meaning he will be in the country on the day of Putinís proposed peace talks.

Trumpís dropping of his demand for Russia to agree to a ceasefire marks a dramatic change in approach. Last week, Trump had called for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine, without providing a deadline. ìIf the ceasefire is not respected, the US and its partners will impose further sanctions,î he warned. The European leaders in Kyiv added weight to the threat by naming Monday as a deadline.

Radchenko said that Putinís late-night offer of peace talks was an attempt to shift the pressure on Russia back onto Ukraine.

ìHe knows that Trump wants direct talks,î Radchenko said. ìNow, by saying, ëLook, weíre offering talks and the Ukrainians are the ones who are not agreeing,í he is putting the ball back in Kyivís court.î

As well as distracting from his snubbing the ceasefire proposal, the offer allowed Putin to pose ìas the peacemaker, kindly inviting Ukraine to the table,î Radchenko said. ìHeís seen as taking the initiative.î

In his address, Putin said Russia does not rule out that ìduring these talks there will be a possibility to arrange some kind of new truce, a new ceasefire,î but stressed that the talks will aim to eliminate the ìroot causesî of the conflict.

Around the same time as Putinís late-night speech, a three-day pause in fighting ordered by Russiaís leader came to an end, with Ukraine reporting more than 100 drone attacks overnight. Both sides accused each other of continuing attacks during the truce, ordered by Putin to mark Russiaís World War II Victory Day.

Trump embrace of Syria and its jihadist-turned-president could shake up the Middle East,"US President Donald Trump on Wednesday had tea with a former jihadist who until recently had a $10 million US bounty on his head.

Interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, once known by his militant nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, met Trump in Riyadh six months after leading a swift campaign that toppled the half-a-century-old Assad regime, ejecting Iran-backed armed groups and declaring himself leader of the country.

Al Sharaa was placed on the US Specially Designated Global Terrorist list in 2013 for heading al Qaedaís affiliate in Syria, known as Al Nusra Front, and allegedly orchestrating suicide bombings across Syria. The Saudi-born former jihadist had spent years fighting US forces in Iraq before moving to Syria to lead an armed Islamist rebellion that ousted the brutal dictator Bashar al-Assad.


The meeting, described by Syria as ìhistoric,î was the first between a US and Syrian president in 25 years, taking place during Trump Middle East tour, the first set of state visits of his second term.

Both leaders were seen smiling in photos released by the White House and the Saudi foreign ministry. The Syrian foreign ministry said Trump committed to ìstanding by Syria at this critical juncture.î

A day earlier, Trump announced the removal of decades-old sanctions on Syria, a move that prompted a 40-second-long applause from the audience, including a standing ovation from the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
ìOh, what I do for the Crown Prince,î Trump told the room on Tuesday, crediting the de facto Saudi leader for leading the effort to lift what the president called ìbrutal and cripplingî sanctions. Syria has been designated by the US as a State Sponsor of Terrorism since December 1979.

Syriaís economy has been crippled for years by Western sanctions. Among the harshest is the USí 2019 Caesar Act, which imposed wide-ranging sanctions that restricted individuals, companies or governments from economic activities assisting Assadís war effort. The act rendered the entire economy untouchable. According to the World Bank, the countryís economy shrank by more than half between 2010 and 2020.

As of 2022, poverty was affecting 69% of Syriaís population, according to the World Bank. Extreme poverty affected more than one in four Syrians in 2022, the bank said, adding that this number likely deteriorated after a devastating earthquake in February 2023.

Gulf states have been keen to invest in Syria and prop up its economy but have been wary of violating US sanctions. Trumpís move is likely to remove such barriers, making way for potentially billions of dollars in investments.During the meeting, Trump proposed that Sharaa take a series of measures, including normalization with Israel, expelling foreign and Palestinian ìterrorists,î and helping the US to prevent the resurgence of ISIS, according to the White House.

Bringing Syria in from the cold gives a lifeline to the countryís fledgling regime and its president, who pledged in an interview with CNN last year that Syriaís armed opposition ultimately plans to form a government defined by institutions and a ìcouncil chosen by the people.î But it also presents an opportunity for Gulf Arab states and Turkey, which also pushed for sanctions to be lifted, to expand their influence in Syria and profit from it after decades of being left out of the country.

ìThe fact that he (Trump) did it so publicly and from Riyadh I think is a sort of tacit approval for those who are looking to invest in Syria potentially as well,î Natasha Hall of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) said. ì(It) means that he is giving wins to Mohammed bin Salman.î

Cautious optimism among Syrians
Fireworks lit up the skies in some of Syriaís biggest cities after Trump announced the lifting of sanctions. Billboards were erected thanking Trump and Prince Mohammed.

ìI donít know how life would be without sanctions,î said Ranim Sakhal, who said she has lived under sanctions since she was born in the 1970s. ìThe country has been suffocating.î

ìPeople are optimistic and our dream is for Arab countries to help, which is something we havenít seen for years because of Basharís rivalry with Arab leaders,î Sakhal added.

Syriaís currency, the Lira, rose by as much as 27% against the US dollar following the announcement. The countryís economy and trade minister, Mohammad Nidal al-Shaar, shed tears live on air with Saudi outlet Al Arabiya, as he underscored that Syria is ìnow entering a new phase.îBut the optimism is not universal. The lifting of sanctions would go far in giving legitimacy to Sharaaís new regime, and some in Syria are concerned about how minorities will be treated by the former jihadists.

ìWe are glad about itÖthank God. After all these years the economy could be revitalized. The prices are very high, products are unavailable so, God willing, it will be the beginning of economic improvement in the country,î George, a resident of Damascus who declined to share his last name, told CNN. The lifting of sanctions however shouldnít be construed as a tacit approval of the regime without bringing to justice those involved in the killing of minorities, he said.

ìWe face a number of extremist groups that restrict freedoms,î he said. ìIf a guy and a girl are seen together in public, the guy could be detained and just disappear. Men can be beaten for wearing shortsÖ itís an extreme infringement on personal freedoms.î

In March, armed men loyal to the new Syrian regime carried out field executions and spoke of purifying the country after a crackdown against remnants of the former Assad regime spiraled into communal killings against the Alawite minority. The United Nations said at the time that entire families, including women and children, were killed during the violence.

An opportunity for Saudi Arabia
For decades, Gulf Arab states were left out of Syria as their rival Iran expanded its influence in the country through its alliance with the Assad regime.

A decade-long civil war in Syria severely strained relations between Damascus and most Arab states, eventually culminating in Syriaís expulsion from the Arab League. Over the past few years, Gulf states began mending fences with the Assad regime and were leading the effort to rehabilitate him until he was abruptly ousted from power in December. Since then, Saudi Arabia and Qatar doubled down on getting the new regime re-integrated into the international community.

Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan announced on Wednesday that Riyadh will be at the ìforefrontî of Syriaís economic revival. Its efforts could allow it to become a significant player in the country and expand its influence there for the first time.

ìSyria will not be alone. Saudi ArabiaÖ will be at the forefront of the supporters to that economic awakeningÖ (Syria) needs a push, and it will receive that push from its brothers in the region,î bin Farhan said at a news conference on Wednesday.

Hasan Alhasan, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said Saudi Arabia has ìgeostrategic interests in the Middle Eastî that can be achieved through support for the current Syrian regime.

ìSaudi Arabia wants Syria to be stable, it recognizes that the only way in which you can get to a stable Syria is by providing the current administration with the economic resources and tools to deliver a so-called victory,î he said.
Defying Israel
During the Biden administration, the US and Saudi Arabia were close to reaching a comprehensive security and economic agreement that would have led to the normalization of relations between the kingdom and Israel.

Despite Trumpís desire for Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel, no such normalization materialized during his visit to Riyadh. Instead, the president said he would establish ties with Sharaa, a move that defied Israel, which has repeatedly bombed Syria and seized more of its territory since the fall of Assad.

An Israeli official told CNN that when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Trump in Washington in April, he asked the president not to remove sanctions on Syria, saying he feared it would lead to a repeat of the events of October 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants attacked Israel.

Netanyahu had taken an aggressive stance with Sharaa and his new government. In the days that followed Assadís ouster, he ordered an unprecedented ground push into Syria, driving Israeli forces deeper into the country than ever before and upending Israelís 50-year tacit dÈtente with the Assads.

The escalation quickly abandoned Netanyahuís initial pledge to practice ìgood neighborlinessî to the new Syria. Hundreds of airstrikes targeted the remnants of Assadís weaponry, particularly its chemical weapons, to prevent them from falling into the hands of militant groups, and Israeli forces seized Mount Hermon, Syriaís highest peak, and a strategically vital position overlooking Israel, Lebanon, and Syria.

ìWe toppled the Assad regime, which essentially was used as the land link between Iran and Hezbollah in Lebanon,î Netanyahu said in a video statement last week.

After meeting Sharaa on Wednesday, Trump heaped praise on him, calling him a ìgreat young attractive guy,î with a ìvery strong pastî who is ìa fighter.î The new Syrian President, he said, has ìgot a real shot at pulling it together.î",5/15/2025,World,Mostafa Salem,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/14/middleeast/syria-trump-meeting-analysis-intl,,,,,,,,,,,,us president donald trump wednesday tea

Israel hits Gaza hospital as strikes resume following hostage release,"Israel struck a hospital in Gaza early Tuesday, a day after briefly pausing military activity for the release of Israeli-American Edan Alexander by Hamas.

The Israeli military resumed strikes in Gaza about an hour after Alexander left the territory, hitting the Al Daraj neighborhood in northern Gaza on Monday evening, before striking the Nasser medical complex in southern Gaza on Tuesday, according to hospital officials.

The IDF strike targeted the surgical ward on the hospitalís third floor, which is now ìcompletely out of service,î killing two patients and wounding medical staff, Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) said.

The target of the strike was Hassan Eslaiah, a prominent Gaza photojournalist who Israel accuses of being a terrorist. He was being treated at the hospital after being wounded in an earlier targeted Israeli airstrike in April.The IDF has accused Eslaiah of taking part in the attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023, and of belonging to Hamasí Khan Younis Brigade, although it has not provided evidence to support those claims.

In a statement following Tuesdayís strike, it described him as working ìunder the guise of a journalistî and said that it had eliminated him and other ìsignificant Hamas terroritsî in a ìprecise strike.îEslaiah crossed into Israel on October 7, 2023, documenting the attacks in photographs that were published by multiple major news organizations. He had previously said he had no forewarning of the attacks and rushed to the scene to document a major news event alongside other photojournalists.

CNN, along with other news organizations, had periodically used material provided by Eslaiah. CNN cut ties with him in November 2023 after new allegations emerged of links to Hamas. CNN said he was not working with the network on October 7, 2023.

Eslaiah said from his hospital bed in April that he faced ìfalse allegationsî from the IDF and that he was ìnot fighting or anything.î

The Ramallah-based Palestinian Journalists Protection Center condemned Eslaiahís killing, demanding an international investigation into what they described as a ìheinous assassination.î The center called Eslaiahís killing the ìdeliberate targeting of the voice of truth.îThe Nasser hospital strike on Tuesday is the latest example of deliberate Israeli attacks on medical facilities in Gaza, for which Israel has been accused of violating international law.

Hospitals are entitled to special protections during armed conflict under international humanitarian law and can only be targeted under extremely limited circumstances, such as if they are being used to actively commit ìan act harmful to the enemy,î according to the Geneva Conventions.

The latest attack on Nasser hospital ìtotally destroyedî two patient rooms, partially damaged three others and a nursing station, according to MAPís medical activity coordinator who is based at Nasser Hospital.

ìThe extension of the intensive care unit, which contains three ICU beds, was also affected ñ its electrical and oxygen systems were damaged in the strike ñ rendering the entire section non-operational,î the coordinator said in a statement provided by MAP.

The strike adds to an already rapidly deteriorating situation for Gazaís medical facilities.

Nasser hospitalís medical director Dr. Atef Al-Hout said the hospital is rapidly running out of fuel to power its generators amid Israelís now 10-week blockade of the strip.

Following the release of Alexander, the Israeli American hostage, the United States is renewing its push for a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.

An Israeli delegation was set to fly to Qatar on Tuesday to resume negotiations, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed those talks will continue ìunder fire,î with no slowdown in Israeli strikes expected without a deal.",13-May-25,World,Oren Liebermann,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/13/middleeast/israel-strike-gaza-hospital-eslaiah-intl,,,,,,,,,,,,israel struck hospital gaza early tuesday day briefly pausing military activity release israeliamerican edan alexander hamas israeli military resumed strikes gaza hour alexander left territory hitting al daraj neighborhood northern gaza monday evening striking nasser medical complex southern gaza tuesday according hospital officials idf strike targeted surgical ward hospital‚Äôs third floor now ‚Äúcompletely service‚Äù killing two patients wounding medical staff medical aid palestinians map said target strike hassan eslaiah prominent gaza photojournalist israel accuses terrorist treated hospital wounded earlier targeted israeli airstrike aprilthe idf accused eslaiah taking part attacks israel october belonging hamas‚Äô khan younis brigade although provided evidence support claims statement following tuesday‚Äôs strike described working ‚Äúunder guise journalist‚Äù said eliminated ‚Äúsignificant hamas terrorits‚Äù ‚Äúprecise strike‚Äùeslaiah crossed israel october documenting attacks photographs published multiple major news organizations previously said forewarning attacks rushed scene document major news event alongside photojournalists cnn along news organizations periodically used material provided eslaiah cnn cut ties november new allegations emerged links hamas cnn said working network october eslaiah said hospital bed april faced ‚Äúfalse allegations‚Äù idf ‚Äúnot fighting anything‚Äù ramallahbased palestinian journalists protection center condemned eslaiah‚Äôs killing demanding international investigation described ‚Äúheinous assassination‚Äù center called eslaiah‚Äôs killing ‚Äúdeliberate targeting voice truth‚Äùthe nasser hospital strike tuesday latest example deliberate israeli attacks medical facilities gaza israel accused violating international law hospitals entitled special protections armed conflict international humanitarian law can targeted extremely limited circumstances used actively commit ‚Äúan act harmful enemy‚Äù according geneva conventions latest attack nasser hospital ‚Äútotally destroyed‚Äù two patient rooms partially damaged three others nursing station according map‚Äôs medical activity coordinator based nasser hospital ‚Äúthe extension intensive care unit contains three icu beds also affected ‚Äì electrical oxygen systems damaged strike ‚Äì rendering entire section nonoperational‚Äù coordinator said statement provided map strike adds already rapidly deteriorating situation gaza‚Äôs medical facilities nasser hospital‚Äôs medical director dr atef alhout said hospital rapidly running fuel power generators amid israel‚Äôs now week blockade strip following release alexander israeli american hostage united states renewing push ceasefire agreement israel hamas israeli delegation set fly qatar tuesday resume negotiations israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu vowed talks continue ‚Äúunder fire‚Äù slowdown israeli strikes expected without deal
Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander returns to Israel after Hamas release," Edan Alexander, the last known living American hostage in Gaza, was released by Hamas and reunited with his family on Monday, ending an 18-month ordeal that began with the militant groupís October 7 attack.

Hamas announced Sunday night it had agreed to free Alexander, 21, after several days of talks with the United States, which bypassed Israel, and formed part of an effort to reach a ceasefire and resume the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza.

Alexander, wearing a black Adidas t-shirt and a baseball cap, was photographed during his handover to the Red Cross, shortly before his convoy left Khan Younis and headed towards Israel. He later arrived at an Israeli military base for a medical assessment and a long-awaited reunion with his family.


Alexander had spoken to his mother, Yael, on the phone after Hamas released him. Footage shared by the Israel Defense Forces showed Steve Witkoff, the US Middle East envoy, handing a phone to Yael.

ìYouíre out, my soul, youíre out!î she exclaimed in the emotional clip. ìEverythingís alright, youíre fine, youíre safe, youíre home. Everything is good. Youíve got this. Youíre strong. Weíre meeting soon.îFollowing a medical evaluation, Alexanderís condition appeared ìstable over all,î Professor Gil Fire from Tel Avivís Sourasky Medical Center said in a statement Tuesday. Alexander was born in the same hospital, according to the doctor, who added that the team there would further assess the full medical implications of his prolonged captivity in the coming days.In Tel Aviv, Alexander was shown holding US and Israeli flags as he embraced members of his family. The reunion comes as US President Donald Trump embarks on a Middle East tour, with stops planned in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.

The Trump administration had circumvented Israel to seal the deal with Hamas to free Alexander, with Trump framing it as a step ìto put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones.î

A New Jersey native, Alexander was serving in the Israeli military near the Gaza border when he was abducted by Hamas on October 7, 2023. Yael described her son as ìsuch an American kid, full of life, very funny, very friendlyî in an interview with CNN in March.

Following Alexanderís release, 58 hostages are still being held in Gaza, with at least 20 believed to be alive. Among the deceased hostages are four American citizens, including husband and wife Gadi Haggai and Judi Weinstein Haggai, as well as soldiers Itay Chen and Omer Neutra.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Monday ìa very emotional moment,î effusively praising Trump for securing Alexanderís release and defending his ongoing campaign in Gaza.

ìThis was achieved thanks to our military pressure and the diplomatic pressure applied by President Trump. This is a winning combination,î Netanyahu said.

ìI spoke with President Trump today. He told me ëI am committed to Israel. I am committed to continuing to work with you in close cooperationí ñ- in order to achieve all of our war objectives: Releasing all of the hostages, and defeating Hamas,î his statement continued. ìThis goes together. They are combined with each other.îA crowd gathered in Tel Avivís ìHostage Squareî to watch his release take place. They cheered as it became clear that Alexander was handed over to Israeli forces.

Alexanderís mother boarded a flight to Israel on Sunday night to meet her son after his release. A photo posted by US Special Envoy for Hostage Response Adam Boehler showed Yael Alexander on a commercial flight with the envoyís team.

Alexanderís parents, Yael and Adi, thanked Trump, Witkoff and Boehler for their role in bringing their son home, during a speech at Sourasky Medical Center on Tuesday. Neither mentioned Netanyahu.

His father said Edan would soon be returning to the United States, ìto watch his little brother play basketball and reunite with his friends in New Jersey.î

ìHeís 21 now and those happy times may include a beer or two, but we will never forget the first beer he had on the rooftop of this very building since his release,î Adi Alexander added.

ëMonumental newsí
Trump hailed the development as ìmonumental newsî in a post on Truth Social, where he described Alexanderís release by Hamas as a ìstep taken in good faith toward the United States and the efforts of the mediators ñ Qatar and Egypt ñ to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones.î

Hamas leader Mahmoud Mardawi told the Hamas-affiliated Al Aqsa TV that the militant group, classified as a terrorist organization by the US and Israel, directly negotiated with the US to free Alexander in exchange for the resumption of humanitarian aid into Gaza.

Witkoff told CNN the talks with Hamas were indirect.
Alexander was last seen in a proof-of-life video in mid-April in which he appealed directly to Trump for help in securing his release. Just days later, Hamas claimed they had lost contact with the group of militants holding Alexander.

Gaza is on the brink of famine as Israelís blockade of humanitarian aid and commercial goods stretches into its second month, depleting food warehouses and soup kitchens, and sending the cost of basic goods skyrocketing.

Israel says it cut off the entry of humanitarian aid to pressure Hamas to release hostages. But international organizations say its actions violate international law, with some accusing Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war ñ a war crime.Israel has not said if it will resume humanitarian aid into Gaza.

Netanyahuís office said in a statement on Monday that Israel has not committed to a ceasefire, nor the release of any Palestinian prisoners, only to ìa safe corridor that will allow for Edanís release.î

In a post on social media Sunday night, Trump said he hoped the release would lead to the ìend (of) this brutal conflict.î But the long-time Israeli prime minister has said that ìnegotiations will take place under fire.î

Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah, said in a Monday statement welcomed efforts to halt the war and issued rare praise for Trump.

Abbas ìcommended US President Donald Trump for his position, in which the latter hopes to bring an end to the vicious conflict and the war that has been going on for two years,î the statement from his office said.

Alexanderís parents had fought tirelessly for his release. Speaking to CNN in March, Yael said she prayed and hoped she would see her son again.

"One in five people in Gaza face starvation, report warns, as Israel months-long blockade continues","One in five people in the Gaza Strip are facing starvation as the entire territory edges closer to famine, a new United Nations-backed report warns, after nearly three months of Israelís blockade of critically needed humanitarian aid.

The warning comes as the UN and several NGOs, as well as civilians in Gaza, say the situation has deteriorated since Israel launched its renewed assault on the enclave in March, as residents struggle to access food, medicine and clean water.The enclaveís entire population is experiencing ìhigh levels of acute food securityî and the territory is at ìhigh riskî of famine, the most severe type of hunger crisis, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said in its latest report Monday.


ìGoods indispensable for peopleís survival are either depleted or expected to run out in the coming weeks,î the IPC said. Food is running out, and what little is left is being sold at exorbitant prices that few can afford, it said.

Israel imposed a humanitarian blockade on Gaza on March 2, cutting off food, medical supplies, and other aid to the more than 2 million Palestinians who live in the territory. Israel says the blockade, along with the militaryís expansion of its bombardment of Gaza, is intended to pressure Hamas to release hostages held in the enclave ñ but international organizations say it violates international law, with some accusing Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war.There is a ìhigh riskî that famine will occur between now and the end of September, the IPC report warned, leaving most people in Gaza without access to food, water, shelter, and medicine.ìOnly an immediate and sustained cessation of hostilities and the resumption of humanitarian aid delivery can prevent a descent into famine,î the report said.

Under the IPC system ñ a five-phase scale used to measure the severity of food insecurity ñ a famine can only be declared if data shows certain thresholds are met. Those conditions are: at least 20% of all households must face an extreme food shortage, 30% or more of children must be acutely malnourished, and at least 2 in every 10,000 people die every day because of outright starvation or the interaction of malnutrition and disease.The first threshold has already been met, according to the IPC. Nearly 469,500 people ñ around 22% of the population - will likely experience ìcatastrophicî food insecurity, the highest phase on the IPC scale, between May and September, the report said.

David Mencer, a spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuís office, said Monday that ìfamine has never happenedî in Gaza, despite IPC warnings, and that if there is hunger in Gaza, it is caused by Hamas depriving civilians of humanitarian aid.

Whilst largely pinning the blame on Hamas for rising hunger levels, US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee on Friday acknowledged the rapidly deteriorating situation in Gaza, telling CNN: ìIf there wasnít a humanitarian crisis, there wouldnít be an effort to try to deal with it. So, the answer is, obviously yes, there is a humanitarian crisis.î

Since March, Israelís renewed assault has displaced more than 430,000 people, the report said, disrupting essential services and the distribution of critical supplies.All 25 bakeries run by the UNís World Food Programme (WFP) were forced to shutter at the beginning of April due to lack of supplies, and food is running out at most of the 177 hot meal kitchens, according to the IPC report. And food prices are soaring.

Prices for flour have increased 3,000% since February and 55-pound sack of wheat flour can run anywhere between $235 and $520, the report said.

At a Monday press conference, the UN Secretary Generalís spokesperson StÈphane Dujarric said only ìabout 260,000 meals have been prepared and delivered across the Gaza Stripî on Monday, which is a 70% reduction since last Wednesday.

According to the spokesperson, the blockade, which has passed 70 days, has depleted UN agenciesí food reserves. ìStocks have run out, bakeries have shut down, community kitchens are closing daily, and people are starving,î he said.

Pregnant women and children among the most at risk
Children and pregnant women are at particularly high risk. Nearly 71,000 cases of acute malnutrition among children under five are expected between April 2025 and March 2026, the report said. And nearly 17,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women will need treatment for acute malnutrition, it said.

During the nineteen months since Israel launched its assault on Gaza in the wake of the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel, people have resorted to scavenging for food, eating grass and animal feed, and drinking polluted water. Starving mothers have been unable to produce enough milk to feed their babies and parents have scrambled to keep their children alive, parents and doctors told CNN.

Imran Rajab, a mother living in Gaza city, told CNN earlier this month she was forced to bake bread using flour from a garbage dumpster to feed her six children.ìMy kids are vomiting after they eat it. It smells horrible,î Rajab said. ìBut what else can I do? What will I feed my children if not this?î

Dr. Amjad Al-Muzaini, a gynecologist working in Gaza City, said women in Gaza are forced to choose between feeding their children or caring for their own health. Most often, they sacrifice their own well-being to ensure survival, he said.

While doing cesarean surgeries, women were found to have severely deteriorated intestinal and uterine tissues, Al-Muzaini said, likely the effects of eating poor-quality and mainly canned foods.The WFP has said recently it is ready to surge enough aid into Gaza to feed the entire population for up to two months. UNRWA, the main UN agency supporting Palestinians, said it has nearly 3,000 trucks filled with aid waiting to cross into Gaza that is currently blocked by Israel.

ìFamilies in Gaza are starving while the food they need is sitting at the border,î the WFPís Executive Director, Cindy McCain said on X. ìBut WFP hasnít been able to get new aid in since 2 March.î

ìIf we wait for famine to be officially confirmed, it will be TOO LATE,î she said.

Israel launched its war in Gaza following Hamasí October 2023 attack in which militants killed 1,200 people and took 251 hostage. Since then, Israelís military campaign has killed almost 53,000 Palestinians. Since Israel resumed its bombardment in March, more than 2,500 Palestinians have been killed, according to figures provided by the Ministry of Health in Gaza.",13-May-25,World,"Lex Harvey, Abeer

Trump says he has a little problem with Tim Cook,"New York
CNN
 ó 
President Donald Trump isnít pleased with Apple CEO Tim Cookís plan to manufacture iPhones bound for the United States at newly built plants in India.

ìI had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,î Trump said Thursday in Qatar. ìI said to him, ëTim, youíre my friend. I treated you very good. Youíre coming in with $500 billion.í But now I hear youíre building all over India. I donít want you building in India.íî

Trump has levied historic tariffs on practically all goods coming into the United States to boost domestic manufacturing, improve the balance of trade and bring in revenue to pay for his planned tax cut, among other aims.

Although some companies, including Apple, have announced plans to increase production in the United States to avoid high tariffs, factories take years to build and American labor remains expensive. Corporate America canít just flip a switch and start making everything in the United States.

Trump said Apple can build in India ìto take care of Indiaî and claimed that Apple is ìupping their production in the United States.î (Apple didnít immediately respond for comment.)

His comments follow Appleís decision to shift production of iPhones sold in the United States from China to India so Apple can avoid paying higher tariffs. The company said that tariffs could add $900 million to its costs this quarter.

Cook said on a call with analysts earlier this month that he expected ìthe majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin.î

Apple had working to shift some iPhone production to India for years, building new factories in the country and hiring staff. The company has no ability to produce iPhones in the United States, and, given the complexity of its supply chain, probably wonít build its most popular product in America anytime soon.

Although the Trump administration is eager to get Apple to bring iPhone production here, itís an ambition that analysts have said is nearly impossible to achieve because of high costs.

The price of an iPhone could triple to $3,500 if they were made here, according to Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities,

Apple previously announced in February a $500 billion plan on expanding US facilities over the next four years that would create 20,000 jobs.

The investment builds on Appleís previous efforts to expand its supply chain outside of China in recent years, partly in response to production issues in the country during the pandemic. Those investments include growing production for Mac Pro computers in Texas.",15-May-25,Business,Jordan Valinsky,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/15/tech/tim-cook-donald-trump-india-problem,,,,,,,,,,,,new york cnn ‚Äî president donald trump isn‚Äôt pleased apple ceo tim cook‚Äôs plan manufacture iphones bound united states newly built plants india ‚Äúi little problem tim cook yesterday‚Äù trump said thursday qatar ‚Äúi said ‚Äòtim you‚Äôre friend treated good you‚Äôre coming billion‚Äô now hear you‚Äôre building india don‚Äôt want building india‚Äô‚Äù trump levied historic tariffs practically goods coming united states boost domestic manufacturing improve balance trade bring revenue pay planned tax cut among aims although companies including apple announced plans increase production united states avoid high tariffs factories take years build american labor remains expensive corporate america can‚Äôt just flip switch start making everything united states trump said apple can build india ‚Äúto take care india‚Äù claimed apple ‚Äúupping production united states‚Äù apple didn‚Äôt immediately respond comment comments follow apple‚Äôs decision shift production iphones sold united states china india apple can avoid paying higher tariffs company said tariffs add million costs quarter cook said call analysts earlier month expected ‚Äúthe majority iphones sold us india country origin‚Äù apple working shift iphone production india years building new factories country hiring staff company ability produce iphones united states given complexity supply chain probably won‚Äôt build popular product america anytime soon although trump administration eager get apple bring iphone production it‚Äôs ambition analysts said nearly impossible achieve high costs price iphone triple made according dan ives global head technology research wedbush securities apple previously announced february billion plan expanding us facilities next four years create jobs investment builds apple‚Äôs previous efforts expand supply chain outside china recent years partly response production issues country pandemic investments include growing production mac pro computers texas
"Jamie Dimon continues to warn of recession, despite pullback in China tariffs","CNN
 ó 
While many economists are saying the risk of an imminent recession has diminished since China and the United States agreed to lower tariffs earlier this week, JPMorgan Chaseís CEO, Jamie Dimon, is still penciling one in.

ìI wouldnít take it off the table at this point,î Dimon said in a Bloomberg TV interview on Thursday at an annual conference the bank hosts in Paris.

After the trade breakthrough from weekend talks in Geneva between Trump administration officials and Chinese government officials, JPMorgan economists lowered the risk of the US economy entering a recession to below 50% from 60% previously.

Dimon said the agreement the US reached with China, which entailed the US lowering tariffs on most Chinese goods to a minimum of 30% from 145% and China lowering tariffs on most American goods to 10% from 125% for the next three months, was ìthe right thing to do.î

ìIt obviously calms down the markets. Thatís not the reason to do it, but the markets do vote, or something like that,î he said. After the deal was announced on Monday, US stocks surged, with the Dow closing nearly 1,200 points higher on that day. Now the index is just barely in negative territory for the year after it, along with other major indexes, fell sharply last month after President Donald Trump rolled out a slew of higher tariffs.

Meanwhile, the Nasdaq, which had entered a bear market on April 4, closed up more than 20% earlier this week from its lowest point this year ó exiting its bear market and marking the start of a new bull market. (A rise of 20% from a recent low generally marks a bull market.)

New Jersey rail strike could cause nightmare for commuters  and Shakira and Beyonc fans,"CNN
 ó 
Engineers at New Jersey Transit are poised to go on strike one minute after midnight Friday morning, a stoppage that would create huge problems for 100,000 daily train commuters, businesses across the New York metropolitan area as well as fans of Shakira and BeyoncÈ, who will have trouble getting to concerts the two stars have planned in upcoming shows.

The railroad and its engineers appear far apart from reaching an 11th hour deal that would avert the strike after 87% of rank-and file members of the International Brotherhood of Engineers and Trainmen voted against a previous tentative deal that would have given them their first raise since 2019.

Railroad officials are urging the commuters who ride its trains daily to make other plans and to work from home, if possible. The majority of commuters on the nationís third-largest commuter railroad use New Jersey Transit to get to their jobs in New York City.

Besides the congestion that will likely clog the bridges and tunnels that span the Hudson River, many commuters to the city would be hit with up to a $9 ìcongestion pricingî toll, in addition to bridge and tunnel tolls that can cost more than twice that amount.

Terms of the rejected deal were not disclosed, but the union had gone into the negotiations seeking raises of 18% to 23% for its 500 members. The union says its members are paid about about 20% less than their counterparts at Amtrak, and three other commuter railroads in the region.

ìWe, the locomotive engineers of NJ Transit are asking only for a fair and competitive wage,î said Thomas Haas, the general chairman of the unionís unit representing the nearly 500 engineers at the railroad, in remarks Wednesday night before the meeting of NJ Transitís board. ìWe are now almost out of time to solve this problem before a work stoppage takes place. The last thing we want to see is that (service) to be interrupted. But weíre at the end of our rope.î

After the meeting, NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri told reporters that heís still confident a strike can be avoided.

ìWe reached a deal once before. It unfortunately got voted down. But we have 29 hours left before a strike would start,î he said.

ìWe reached a deal once before. It unfortunately got voted down. But we have 29 hours left before a strike would start,î he said.

Kolluri also pointed out that the agency recently reached a deal with its bus drivers. He said the two sides would be at the table Thursday, trying to reach a new deal.

ìWhat I can represent to you is that the conversations have been constructive,î he said. ìWeíre all trying to work towards the same objective.î

But he said a deal would need to be one that is ìfiscally responsible.î

Beyond the commuters who use the trains to get to and from jobs, mostly in New York City, the strike could cause huge problems for fans of Shakira, who is set to perform at MetLife Stadium Thursday and Friday night, less than 10 miles from the Lincoln Tunnel that links New Jersey and Manhattan, and for fans of BeyoncÈ, who is due to perform there for a series of five shows starting next Thursday.

NJ Transit has already canceled service to Thursdayís Shakira show. Concertgoers who drive to the Shakira or the BeyoncÈ shows could find themselves stuck in worse-than-normal traffic as other regular train passengers are forced onto the road.

Congress unlikely to act to end strike
Railroads operate under an arcane century-old federal law, the Railway Labor Act, that controls labor relations at railroads and airlines, greatly limiting the unionís ability to go on strike. Even when members of a union reject a contract, as has happened in this case, they can be ordered to stay on the job and accept the terms of the deal through an act of Congress.

Thatís what happened in December of 2022, when Congress voted in favor of a deal rejected by the majority of the more than 100,000 union members who work at the nationís four major freight railroads.

But itís not clear that Congress will feel as compelled to act in the case of a single commuter railroad as it was in the case of the freight railroads. While Congress has not stood by and allowed the nationís freight railroads to have a strike longer than a few hours, there have been numerous examples of commuter rail strikes that have stretched on for weeks, even months without Congressional action to end it.

Back in 1983, New Jersey Transit was on strike for one month. Also in the 1980s, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority (SEPTA) was on strike for 108 days, Metro North, which is the commuter line serving the suburbs north of New York, was on strike for 42 days, and an 11-day work stoppage occurred on the Long Island Railroad.

Powell warns of more volatile inflation as latest data shows impact from tariffs,"CNN
 ó 
US wholesale prices sank in April, logging their biggest monthly drop since Covid stifled the economy, as tariffs put a squeeze on profit margins, according to new data released Thursday.

The Producer Price Index, a closely watched measurement of wholesale inflation, showed Thursday that the prices paid to US producers dropped 0.5% in April from the month before, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

On an annual basis, inflation slowed to 2.4% from March, which saw sharp upward revisions to the initial estimates. A 0.4% monthly decline and a 2.7% annual rate were revised up to 0% and 3.4%, respectively.

Economists were expecting monthly prices to rise in April by 0.2% and to slow to 2.4% on an annual basis, according to FactSet.

A driving force behind the downward monthly swing was a 1.7% plunge in trade services, a category that measures gross margins for wholesalers and retailers.

Although itís a volatile category, the sharp downward swing in trade services indicates that companiesí margins are being eaten away by higher costs from President Donald Trumpís tariffs, Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, told CNN on Thursday.

ìWe are beginning to see the impact of trade policy filtering into the hard data in such a way that itís impossible to deny that it is now affecting revenues and profit margins for firms,î Brusuelas said.

Those higher costs will likely start spilling over to consumers soon, he said.

And the economy-powering consumers are already showing some signs of fatigue: Sales at US retailers slowed sharply in April to 0.1% after a surge of 1.7% in March, when shoppers rushed to beat the slew of new tariffs.

Increased volatility could keep interest rates elevated
Separately on Thursday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that ìsupply shocksî could force the central bank to keep rates higher over the long term.

ìWe may be entering a period of more frequent, and potentially more persistent, supply shocks ó a difficult challenge for the economy and for central banks,î Powell said.

He noted that ìinflation could be more volatile going forward than in the inter-crisis period of the 2010s.î

On Tuesday, the latest Consumer Price Index data showed that overall inflation cooled further for the goods and services Americans commonly purchase. However, some economists pegged some of that softening to weaker demand.

US wholesale prices sank in April, logging their biggest monthly drop since Covid stifled the economy, as tariffs put a squeeze on profit margins, according to new data released Thursday.

The Producer Price Index, a closely watched measurement of wholesale inflation, showed Thursday that the prices paid to US producers dropped 0.5% in April from the month before, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

On an annual basis, inflation slowed to 2.4% from March, which saw sharp upward revisions to the initial estimates. A 0.4% monthly decline and a 2.7% annual rate were revised up to 0% and 3.4%, respectively.

ìWe are beginning to see the impact of trade policy filtering into the hard data in such a way that itís impossible to deny that it is now affecting revenues and profit margins for firms,î Brusuelas said.

Those higher costs will likely start spilling over to consumers soon, he said.

And the economy-powering consumers are already showing some signs of fatigue: Sales at US retailers slowed sharply in April to 0.1% after a surge of 1.7% in March, when shoppers rushed to beat the slew of new tariffs.

Increased volatility could keep interest rates elevated
Separately on Thursday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that ìsupply shocksî could force the central bank to keep rates higher over the long term.

ìWe may be entering a period of more frequent, and potentially more persistent, supply shocks ó a difficult challenge for the economy and for central banks,î Powell said.

He noted that ìinflation could be more volatile going forward than in the inter-crisis period of the 2010s.î

On Tuesday, the latest Consumer Price Index data showed that overall inflation cooled further for the goods and services Americans commonly purchase. However, some economists pegged some of that softening to weaker demand.

Trumpís bevy of tariffs is widely expected to make items more expensive in the months to come and drive inflation higher.

PPI, which serves as a potential bellwether for retail-level inflation in the months ahead, is starting to show some of those pressures.

On the surface, the April PPI report appeared to portray a welcome decline in key areas, notably energy and food ó including a continued plummeting of egg prices, which dropped 39.3% in April after falling 21.3% in March.

Excluding food and energy, which can be volatile, core PPI also showed some softness, largely due to the big negative swing from trade services: Prices fell 0.4% for the month and annual inflation slowed to 3.1% from 4%.

Higher prices on the way
Despite the seemingly cool reading, tariffs are making their mark, Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds, told CNN.

ìGoods prices are picking up,î he said.

Stripping out food and energy, prices for goods have been steadily on the rise. After posting a 0.1% increase in December, that category rose 0.2% in January, 0.3% in February and March, and 0.4% in April, Rupkey noted.

The 0.4% increase is the fastest monthly inflation for that category in more than two years, BLS data shows.

ìIt looks like some of the fears of what is going to happen from these import tariffs is becoming a reality, and that is goods prices going up,î he said. ìThatís a worrisome sign for inflation down the road, meaning it could be only a couple of months away.î

And on Thursday, the worldís largest retailer said as much: Walmartís chief executive officer told investors and analysts that Trumpís tariffs are ìtoo high,î and that the company will start raising prices at its stores later this month.

ìWe will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible,î Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said Thursday on an earnings call. ìBut, given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we arenít able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins.î

ìThe higher tariffs will result in higher prices,î he said.

Americans pulled back significantly on spending as higher tariffs took effect in April,"In a sign that consumer demand may be fraying around the edges, spending at US retailers slowed sharply in April to 0.1% after a surge of 1.7% in March as shoppers rushed to beat President Donald Trumpís stiff tariffs.

The April data was worse than the 0.2% monthly rise economists polled by FactSet predicted.

Among the biggest monthly declines was motor vehicle and part sales, which declined to -0.1% in April from 5.5% in March.

Consumer spending is the backbone of the economy, accounting for two-thirds of gross domestic product. The steep drop in retail sales could lead to another quarter of disappointing GDP after the contraction seen last quarter.

Simply put, EY economists said in a Thursday morning note, the ìpre-tariff shopping spree is over.î

The Trump administrationís haphazard tariff blitz in recent months has prompted consumer sentiment to deteriorate, according to various surveys. Now, Wall Street and the Federal Reserve are watching for signs of consumers pulling back in the face of high uncertainty.

Thursdayís report shows that consumer spending has clearly downshifted from the brisk pace of late last year, and that Americansí buying sprints to get ahead of tariffs may already be over.

ìWhatever strength we saw in the economy in the first quarter, I think itís a bit of a mirage,î said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds. ìSales were brought forward to try and avoid higher prices that are surely just around the corner from this trade war with the world.î

The biggest bright spot of the report was spending at bars and restaurants, which increased by 1.2% from March. Spending at grocery stores was unchanged from March. Thatís potentially a positive sign for the US economy, Jefferies economists said in a note on Thursday.

ìSpending less at restaurants and more on groceries would be a logical expression of weaker consumer confidence and greater concern over employment prospects. Currently, we are seeing the opposite, in contrast to the confidence data.î

At the same time, spending on health and personal care as well as apparel and sporting goods all declined in April.

Despite the steep drop in spending across the board from March, Morgan Stanley economists said in a note to clients on Thursday, ìThis report does not change our view that the consumer is at a solid starting point, but we expect a slowdown.î

At the same time, they noted that the weakness in spending came sooner than they anticipated and they ìcontinue to expect a significant slowdown in consumption in the back half of the year as price increases from tariffs weigh on purchasing power.î

Walmart warns it will raise prices because of tariffs,"Walmart, the worldís largest retailer, said President Donald Trumpís tariffs are ìtoo highî and it will raise prices on some items as Trumpís global trade war increases the companyís costs.

ìWe will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible. But given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we arenít able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins,î Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said Thursday on an earnings call.

ìThe higher tariffs will result in higher prices,î he said.

Tariffs on China are raising costs on electronics and toys, McMillon said, and some food costs are going up from tariffs on Costa Rica, Peru and Colombia.

The price hikes will begin later this month.

ìIím concerned that consumer is going to start seeing higher prices. Youíll begin to see that, likely towards the tail end of this month, and then certainly much more in June,î Walmart finance chief John David Rainey said in an interview with CNBC Thursday.

Many companies have been raising prices to mitigate cost increases from the 10% universal tariffs on every product entering the United States and higher levies on Chinese goods. Washington and Beijing reached an agreement to lower those tariffs this week, but the United States still charges a 30% levy on most goods coming from China.

Walmart applauded the Trump administration for bringing down its 145% tariff levels on China, but said the current levels of tariffs are ìtoo high.î

ìThere are certain items, certain categories of merchandise that weíre dependent upon to import from other countries,î Rainey said on the call with analysts. ìPrices of those things are likely going to go up. And thatís not good for consumers.î

Trump says India has offered America no tariffs,"President Donald Trump said on Thursday that India has offered to eliminate tariffs on the United States as part of a potential trade deal ñ but New Delhi soon poured cold water on Trumpís claims, saying negotiations were not complete.

ìIndia is the highest ó one of the highest tariff nations in the world. Itís very hard to sell into India, and theyíve offered us a deal where, basically, theyíre willing to literally charge us no tariff,î Trump said during a roundtable with business leaders in Doha, Qatar.

Indiaís foreign minister S. Jaishankar later said talks were ongoing, calling negotiations between New Delhi and Washington ìcomplicatedî and ìintricate.î

ìNegotiations have been going on,î he told reporters in the Indian capital Thursday. ìThese are very complicated negotiations. They are very intricate. Nothing is decided tillÖ everything is.î

The US president said the tariff India places on US goods is ìso highî that it prevents much business from taking place between the two nations. The White House has long criticized Indiaís high tariffs, including 70% on autos, 20% on some networking equipment, 80% on rice imports. It also has chastised India for its non-tariff trade barriers, including burdensome regulatory requirements for importers.

A zero tariff ó if thatís in fact what India is offering ó would be a welcome change for US companies looking to export their goods to the worldís most populous country.

ì(India) have actually told us, I assume you too, (Treasury Secretary) Scott (Bessent)Ö that there will be no tariff, right? Would you say thatís a difference? Theyíre the highest, and now theyíre saying no tariff,î Trump said.

ìThat would be our expectation from the trade deal. And until that is done. I think any judgment on it would be premature,î he said.

The US is Indiaís largest trade partner as of 2024, yet India ranks tenth in the list of US trading partners for the same year. The trade deficit between the US and India has been widening, with the US importing $45.7 billion more from India than it exported there in 2024, according to data from the US Census Bureau.

India is one of several countries or trading blocks attempting to strike deals with the US after Trumpís sweeping set of tariffs has upended global trade.

Trump has imposed a baseline 10% levy on all goods imported into the US, and threatened to slap so-called ìreciprocal tariffsî at still higher rates on nations in early July. India faces a 26% ìreciprocal tariffî on its goods arriving into the US.

Last week, Trump scored the first big win in his trade war ó a framework for future trade negotiations with Britain that lowers some tariffs on London and potentially opens up the UK market to more American goods.

And, on Monday, the US and China to drastically roll back tariffs on each otherís goods for an initial 90-day period in a surprise breakthrough between the worldís two richest nations.

ëYouíre not treating us rightí
When Trump initially announced plans in February to unveil a package of reciprocal tariffs, he singled out India several times. In particular, the administration has taken issue with Indiaís value-added and digital services taxes as well as the growing goods trade deficit.

ìThey charge more tariffs than any other country,î Trump said on February 13. The comments came hours before he met with Indiaís Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Trump also spoke about India during his Rose Garden ìLiberation Dayî event on April 2. ìIndia, very, very tough,î Trump said. He also mentioned he told Modi when he met with him, ìYouíre not treating us right.î

The White House last month estimated that US exports to India would increase by at least $5.3 billion annually if India dropped its trade barriers ó but itís unclear how the White House arrived at those figures.

The goods trade deficit the US runs with India has nearly doubled since Trumpís first term, though this occurred as both countries roughly doubled the amount of imported goods from one another.

The top goods the US received from India last year included pharmaceuticals; communications equipment, such as smartphones; and apparel. The top American exports to India were various oils and gases, chemicals and aerospace products and parts.",15-May-25,Business,"Anna Cooban, Betsy Klein, Elisabeth Buchwald",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/15/business/india-no-tariffs-trump-intl,,,,,,,,,,,,president donald trump said thursday india offered eliminate tariffs united states part potential trade deal ‚Äì new delhi soon poured cold water trump‚Äôs claims saying negotiations complete ‚Äúindia highest ‚Äî one highest tariff nations world it‚Äôs hard sell india they‚Äôve offered us deal basically they‚Äôre willing literally charge us tariff‚Äù trump said roundtable business leaders doha qatar india‚Äôs foreign minister s jaishankar later said talks ongoing calling negotiations new delhi washington ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù ‚Äúintricate‚Äù ‚Äúnegotiations going on‚Äù told reporters indian capital thursday ‚Äúthese complicated negotiations intricate nothing decided till‚Ä¶ everything is‚Äù us president said tariff india places us goods ‚Äúso high‚Äù prevents much business taking place two nations white house long criticized india‚Äôs high tariffs including autos networking equipment rice imports also chastised india nontariff trade barriers including burdensome regulatory requirements importers zero tariff ‚Äî that‚Äôs fact india offering ‚Äî welcome change us companies looking export goods world‚Äôs populous country ‚Äúindia actually told us assume treasury secretary scott bessent‚Ä¶ tariff right say that‚Äôs difference they‚Äôre highest now they‚Äôre saying tariff‚Äù trump said ‚Äúthat expectation trade deal done think judgment premature‚Äù said us india‚Äôs largest trade partner yet india ranks tenth list us trading partners year trade deficit us india widening us importing billion india exported according data us census bureau india one several countries trading blocks attempting strike deals us trump‚Äôs sweeping set tariffs upended global trade trump imposed baseline levy goods imported us threatened slap socalled ‚Äúreciprocal tariffs‚Äù still higher rates nations early july india faces ‚Äúreciprocal tariff‚Äù goods arriving us last week trump scored first big win trade war ‚Äî framework future trade negotiations britain lowers tariffs london potentially opens uk market american goods monday us china drastically roll back tariffs other‚Äôs goods initial day period surprise breakthrough world‚Äôs two richest nations ‚Äòyou‚Äôre treating us right‚Äô trump initially announced plans february unveil package reciprocal tariffs singled india several times particular administration taken issue india‚Äôs valueadded digital services taxes well growing goods trade deficit ‚Äúthey charge tariffs country‚Äù trump said february comments came hours met india‚Äôs prime minister narendra modi trump also spoke india rose garden ‚Äúliberation day‚Äù event april ‚Äúindia tough‚Äù trump said also mentioned told modi met ‚Äúyou‚Äôre treating us right‚Äù white house last month estimated us exports india increase least billion annually india dropped trade barriers ‚Äî it‚Äôs unclear white house arrived figures goods trade deficit us runs india nearly doubled since trump‚Äôs first term though occurred countries roughly doubled amount imported goods one another top goods us received india last year included pharmaceuticals communications equipment smartphones apparel top american exports india various oils gases chemicals aerospace products parts
Dicks Sporting Goods is buying Foot Locker for $2.4 billion,"Dicks Sporting Goods is buying rival Foot Locker in a $2.4 billion deal, marking another major deal that tariff-prone apparel companies are making to future-proof themselves.

In an announcement Thursday, Dickís said the transaction will help the Pittsburgh-based sporting goods store internationally for the first time. It will maintain the Foot Locker name and run the shoe stores as a standalone business, and it expects to operate its 2,400 stores that span 22 countries.

But the deal comes with some significant risk for Dickís. President Donald Trumpís tariffs threaten the footwear industry as a whole, but Foot Locker, in particular, has been under pressure from the steady decline in Americaís shopping malls. In 2023, the company operated about 3,000 stores, but began closing hundreds of locations.

Foot Locker over the past two years relaunched its retail brand to attract younger, more diverse consumers ó but the reboot hasnít proven successful. In March, the company said its total fourth-quarter sales were down 5.8% year-over-year amid a downturn in Nike shoe sales (Foot Locker is Nikeís largest retail partner).

Dickís investors werenít pleased with the deal Thursday. Shares of Dickís (DKS) dropped 13% in premarket trading. But the company said it believes in the brand.

ìWe believe there is meaningful opportunity for growth ahead,î said Ed Stack, executive chairman for Dickís. ìBy applying our operational expertise to this iconic business, we see a clear path to further unlocking growth and enhancing Foot Lockerís position in the industryî

Foot Lockerís (FL) stock soared 80% in premarket trading following the news. Thursdayís transaction marks a 66% premium of Foot Lockerís stock, which has slumped more than 40% over the past year.

Looming in the backdrop of the deal are Trumpís tumultuous tariff policies. Roughly 99% of shoes and sneakers sold in the US are imported, mostly from China and Vietnam, according to the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America. As such, those tariffs threaten to disrupt global supply chains and drive up the price of footwear.

Dickís is one of the largest sporting goods retailers by market share in the US, with more than 700 stores nationwide. A tie-up with Foot Locker could help the chain expand its retail footprint, Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said.

ìWhile there is some overlap between the locations, the nature of the stores is different, and Foot Locker would give Dickís access to a wider selection of malls and customers,î Saunders said.

Fearing President Donald Trumpís chaotic trade war would ignite a global recession, investors scrambled to dump US assets. The rare simultaneous selloff of both stocks and bonds reflected a serious loss of confidence in White House policy.

Then Trump changed his tune. The president paused so-called ìreciprocal tariffsî for 90 days and later slashed tariffs on China, though many items still face higher tariffs than before the Trump administration.

US stocks reversed course, too, setting off a historic rally on Wall Street in the past month. The S&P 500 has now fully erased the yearís losses and gained nearly $8 trillion in market value since its April 8 lows. Itís a remarkable comeback that underscores palpable relief among investors and easing recession fears since Trumpís stunning reversal.

ìThe markets had a tantrum and stomped their collective feet and got what they wanted: Trump to back off,î Ed Yardeni, president of investment advisory Yardeni Research, told CNN in a phone interview. ìTrump realized he was toying around with liquid nitroglycerine and that it was time to back off.î

ëA free-fall momentí
The early 2025 selloff was breathtaking in its speed and intensity.

It took just 22 days for the S&P 500 to close in correction territory, a 10% drop from its record highs in November ó a fraction of the time it normally takes to get a correction, according to CFRA Research. The S&P 500 narrowly avoided plunging into a bear market.

ìIt was a free-fall moment,î said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab. ìInvestor sentiment got to panic levels.î

The recovery has been just as swift, the fastest since 1982.

It took 25 trading days to go to positive territory from down 15% on the year, according to Bespoke Investment Group. In times of gloomy sentiment, investors might spark speedy rebounds when they finally see a situation change.

ìInvestors think the worst is likely over and that the reason for the panic has largely been undone,î said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.

The whipsaw action in markets underscores how hard it is for even the smartest minds on Wall Street to time markets. And why Nathan Rothschild famously said, ìThe time to buy is when thereís blood in the streets.î",15-May-25,Business,Matt Egan,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/15/markets/stocks-dow-trump-tariffs-trade-war,,,,,,,,,,,,early april wall street threw epic temper tantrum make toddler proud fearing president donald trump‚Äôs chaotic trade war ignite global recession investors scrambled dump us assets rare simultaneous selloff stocks bonds reflected serious loss confidence white house policy trump changed tune president paused socalled ‚Äúreciprocal tariffs‚Äù days later slashed tariffs china though many items still face higher tariffs trump administration us stocks reversed course setting historic rally wall street past month sp now fully erased year‚Äôs losses gained nearly trillion market value since april lows it‚Äôs remarkable comeback underscores palpable relief among investors easing recession fears since trump‚Äôs stunning reversal ‚Äúthe markets tantrum stomped collective feet got wanted trump back off‚Äù ed yardeni president investment advisory yardeni research told cnn phone interview ‚Äútrump realized toying around liquid nitroglycerine time back off‚Äù ‚Äòa freefall moment‚Äô early selloff breathtaking speed intensity took just days sp close correction territory drop record highs november ‚Äî fraction time normally takes get correction according cfra research sp narrowly avoided plunging bear market ‚Äúit freefall moment‚Äù said kevin gordon senior investment strategist charles schwab ‚Äúinvestor sentiment got panic levels‚Äù recovery just swift fastest since took trading days go positive territory year according bespoke investment group times gloomy sentiment investors might spark speedy rebounds finally see situation change ‚Äúinvestors think worst likely reason panic largely undone‚Äù said sam stovall chief investment strategist cfra research whipsaw action markets underscores hard even smartest minds wall street time markets nathan rothschild famously said ‚Äúthe time buy there‚Äôs blood streets‚Äù
Boeing secures largest-ever order from Qatar during Trump visit,"Boeing has secured a deal with Qatar for up to 210 jets in what the White House is calling the aircraft makerss largest-ever widebody order worth $96 billion dollars.

The order comes as the Gulf stateís prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani, dismissed controversy surrounding US President Donald Trumpís plan to accept a Boeing 747-8 to be used, at least initially, as Air Force One, telling CNNís Becky Anderson on Wednesday that itís simply a ìgovernment-to-government transaction,î not a personal gift to Trump.

The potential transfer of the jet, which Trump has said would be donated to his library after he leaves office, has been criticized by Democrats and Republicans alike, with some of Trumpís own supporters pointing to the appearance that Qatar is influence peddling.

Trump was in Doha on Wednesday, where economic deals totalling more than $243 billion between the United States and Qatar were announced, including the ìhistoricî sale of Boeing aircraft and GE Aerospace engines to Qatar Airways.

In a statement unveiling the deal, the White House called Trump the ìdealmaker in chief,î in a nod to his desire to be seen as the ultimate salesman and and diplomat on the world stage.

Boeing said in a separate statement that the order was for 130 of the companyís 787 Dreamliner jets ó a widebody twin-engine ó and 30 of its 777-9s, which is larger than the 787. There are options for an additional 50 Dreamliners and 777X.

ìWe are deeply honored that Qatar Airways has placed this record-breaking order with Boeing, one that solidifies their future fleet with our market-leading widebody airplane family at its center,î Stephanie Pope, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in the statement.

Boeingís stock closed half a percent higher in New York on Wednesday. Although investors are enthused, theyíre also aware that order commitments arenít final, and airlines at times have been known to cancel orders theyíve publicly announced.

Still, the deal is a big shot in the arm for Boeing, which is Americaís largest exporter. Last year, orders effectively ground to a halt after a door plug blew off of an Alaska Airlines 737 Max, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. Even with a rebound in orders toward the end of 2024, Boeingís gross orders were just 569 for all of last year, down a stunning 60% from 2023.

Tariff impact
Also not helping Boeing was a massive strike in the fall. About 33,000 machinists hit the picket lines in September, and Boeing didnít restart production until early December. That sank Boeingís deliveries to just 348 planes last year, down 34% from 2023.

So Trumpís ìLiberation Dayî tariffs have served as a gut-punch to a company already on the ropes because they threaten to make jets millions of dollars more expensive. Boeing also sources parts and supplies from overseas.

The Trump administration appears to be seeking Boeing order commitments as part of its negotiating strategy on trade. Last week, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in the Oval Office that, as part of a larger agreement on a trade framework, a British airline has agreed to purchase $10 billion worth of Boeing jets.

Reuters later reported the airline was IAG, and it would order around 30 of Boeingís 787 widebody jets.

Trumpís delegation also announced other agreements in Qatar. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth signed defense deals, including a statement of intent on defense cooperation between the State of Qatar and the United States. He also signed offer and acceptance letters for MQ-9B, which are remotely piloted aircraft system, and FS-LIDS, which are small aerial systems designed to counter unmanned aircraft.

A day earlier in Saudi Arabia, the Trump delegation announced $600 billion worth of tech and defense deals. And later on Thursday, the group will be moving on to the United Arab Emirates, the last stop of the presidentís first overseas tour of his second term.

Trumps tariffs are changing the way Americans spend,"American consumers, battle-scarred by the pandemic and the subsequent surge in inflation, are already changing their spending patterns and delaying some purchases due to President Donald Trumpís chaotic tariff policy and the broader economic uncertainty, new survey data shows.

The shift in spending plans was among the findings from tax and audit firm KPMGís second annual American Perspectives survey released early Thursday. The survey of 2,500 adults sought to evaluate their personal financial situations as well as how they were adapting to changing forces in the economy, including new tariffs, the rise of generative artificial intelligence and the role of higher education.

The survey was conducted between April 3 and April 23 ó a period that followed Trumpís April 2 announcement of a new slew of massive tariffs and a later pause of dozens of those tariffs. The survey period was before the recent de-escalation of the US and China trade war.

Survey respondents indicated plans to hold off on some major purchases and scale back in other areas of their lives in order to not accumulate debt, according to KPMG.

ìSeeing them go through the Covid cycle and into this new cycle, theyíre quickly adapting to their spend-smart initiatives as they look at their personal finances and ways to control costs and how they evaluate major purchasing decisions,î Matt Kramer, KPMGís US products line of business leader, told CNN in an interview.

ìI think it took a little bit long the last cycle (the pandemic) where they just werenít quite used to making those major adjustments, and maybe the cost of money was a little bit cheaper back then,î he said.

But now, consumers appear to be signaling they have little appetite to incur new debt and are hunkering down more quickly.

About 68% of respondents said they did not want to take on any more credit, according to the report. And many respondents surveyed by KPMG indicated they intend to cut back on purchases both large and small: 43% said they will delay buying a car because of tariffs, and 70% said they already were or planned to use free ad-supported TV as an alternative to ad-free streaming services.

ìTheyíre clearly looking at opportunities to save,î Kramer said. ìTheyíre switching providers where it makes sense, whether thatís their streaming services, whether itís looking at insurance providers.î

Beyond tariffs and personal finances, KPMGís survey showed that GenAI is playing an increasing role in peopleís personal and work lives. About 45% of respondents said GenAI is having a significant impact on their day-to-day personal life as well as their professional life, up from 41% and 40%, respectively last year.

The survey also showed that perceptions have shifted around higher education and that half of respondents said a degree is no longer essential for a well-paying career.

ìApprenticeship, technical training and looking at how technology is advancing and how you can accelerate your skills much more quickly, all of that is playing in to those responses,î Kramer said.",15-May-25,Business,Alicia Wallace,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/15/economy/consumer-tariff-survey-kpmg,,,,,,,,,,,,american consumers battlescarred pandemic subsequent surge inflation already changing spending patterns delaying purchases due president donald trump‚Äôs chaotic tariff policy broader economic uncertainty new survey data shows shift spending plans among findings tax audit firm kpmg‚Äôs second annual american perspectives survey released early thursday survey adults sought evaluate personal financial situations well adapting changing forces economy including new tariffs rise generative artificial intelligence role higher education survey conducted april april ‚Äî period followed trump‚Äôs april announcement new slew massive tariffs later pause dozens tariffs survey period recent deescalation us china trade war survey respondents indicated plans hold major purchases scale back areas lives order accumulate debt according kpmg ‚Äúseeing go covid cycle new cycle they‚Äôre quickly adapting spendsmart initiatives look personal finances ways control costs evaluate major purchasing decisions‚Äù matt kramer kpmg‚Äôs us products line business leader told cnn interview ‚Äúi think took little bit long last cycle pandemic just weren‚Äôt quite used making major adjustments maybe cost money little bit cheaper back then‚Äù said now consumers appear signaling little appetite incur new debt hunkering quickly respondents said want take credit according report many respondents surveyed kpmg indicated intend cut back purchases large small said delay buying car tariffs said already planned use free adsupported tv alternative adfree streaming services ‚Äúthey‚Äôre clearly looking opportunities save‚Äù kramer said ‚Äúthey‚Äôre switching providers makes sense whether that‚Äôs streaming services whether it‚Äôs looking insurance providers‚Äù beyond tariffs personal finances kpmg‚Äôs survey showed genai playing increasing role people‚Äôs personal work lives respondents said genai significant impact daytoday personal life well professional life respectively last year survey also showed perceptions shifted around higher education half respondents said degree longer essential wellpaying career ‚Äúapprenticeship technical training looking technology advancing can accelerate skills much quickly playing responses‚Äù kramer said
Max has a new name. Again,"Max will rebrand once more as HBO Max.

Speaking on stage during Warner Bros. Discoveryís Upfront presentation to advertisers, HBO chief executive Casey Bloys announced that the companyís streaming platform, Max, would revert to its previous name, HBO Max.

WBD executives emphasized that the move is an attempt to emphasize its strongest offerings.

ìWe all know this industry is cluttered. Streaming has become a lot like fast fashion,î Max chief marketing officer Shauna Spenley said on Wednesday. ìSo when we think about our competitive advantage, itís the same one that weíve had at HBO for the last 50 years.î

WBD changed HBO Maxís name to Max in 2023 shortly after WarnerMedia and Discovery merged, creating WBD, in 2022. The company originally rebranded the service as HBO Max in 2020, having pivoted away from the previous name HBO Now, which it announced in 2015. (WBD is also CNNís parent company.)

By changing the streaming platformís name roughly two years ago, WBD intended to highlight its diversity of offerings, which include original IP from HBO, Warner Bros. Pictures and Discovery.

While Warner Bros. Pictures has seen box office success recently with ìA Minecraft Movieî and ìSinners,î the company has suffered several misfires. For years, WBDís superhero arm, DC Studios, has lagged behind Disneyís Marvel Studios, which, despite historic successes, have seen diminishing returns in recent years as audiences experience superhero fatigue.

The change pushes HBO, the crown jewel in WBDís content coffers, to the forefront as it looks to draw audiences to the platform. Though WBDís latest quarterly earnings saw Max report 5.3 million new subscribers, the company still lags behind rivals Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.",14-May-25,Business,Liam Reilly,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/14/media/max-rebrand-hbo,,,,,,,,,,,,max rebrand hbo max speaking stage warner bros discovery‚Äôs upfront presentation advertisers hbo chief executive casey bloys announced company‚Äôs streaming platform max revert previous name hbo max wbd executives emphasized move attempt emphasize strongest offerings ‚Äúwe know industry cluttered streaming become lot like fast fashion‚Äù max chief marketing officer shauna spenley said wednesday ‚Äúso think competitive advantage it‚Äôs one we‚Äôve hbo last years‚Äù wbd changed hbo max‚Äôs name max shortly warnermedia discovery merged creating wbd company originally rebranded service hbo max pivoted away previous name hbo now announced wbd also cnn‚Äôs parent company changing streaming platform‚Äôs name roughly two years ago wbd intended highlight diversity offerings include original ip hbo warner bros pictures discovery warner bros pictures seen box office success recently ‚Äúa minecraft movie‚Äù ‚Äúsinners‚Äù company suffered several misfires years wbd‚Äôs superhero arm dc studios lagged behind disney‚Äôs marvel studios despite historic successes seen diminishing returns recent years audiences experience superhero fatigue change pushes hbo crown jewel wbd‚Äôs content coffers forefront looks draw audiences platform though wbd‚Äôs latest quarterly earnings saw max report million new subscribers company still lags behind rivals netflix amazon prime video
Elon Musks Grok AI chatbot brought up white genocide in unrelated queries,"Some X users on Wednesday asked Grok  the AI chatbot available through Elon Musks social media platform  questions about simple topics like baseball players or videos of fish being flushed down toilets. One user just asked Grok to talk like a pirate.

In response, they got replies about the theory of ìwhite genocideî in South Africa, puzzling some X users as they tried to engage with what has largely been seen as Muskís answer to ChatGPT.

The bizarre answers ñ all publicly posted on X - came as AI chatbots have been scrutinized over possible bias or their tendency to ìhallucinateî and make up answers, raising questions over the accuracy of the information they provide. It also comes as the issue of White South Africans has gained prominence this week with several dozen being granted special refugee status in the United States, after Musk and others have long alleged rampant discrimination and even ìgenocideî against them. Musk, who was born and raised in South Africa, recently said he sold X to his AI company xAI to allow for closer integration between his social media platform and AI efforts.

xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In one interaction CNN found, a user asked Grok to discuss another user ìin the style of pirate.î Grokís initial response made sense for the query; it began its reply with ìArgh, mateyî and said ìno grand loot or lore found in me charts ëbout their deeds or nameî in reference to the X user mentioned in the question. But then it abruptly shifted to the subject of ìwhite genocide,î all while staying in ìpirate talk.îBy late Wednesday afternoon, many of the inaccurate Grok replies about ìwhite genocideî were deleted.

ìAs for ìwhite genocideî in South Africa, ëtis a stormy claim! Some cry it be real, pointiní to farm attacksó50 or so a year, say groups like AfriForum, blaminí racial motives. Yet courts and scribes, like the BBC, call it a myth, sayiní attacks be crime, not race-driven, and land laws aim to fix old wrongs, not target whites. Official tallies show farm murders droppiní low by 2018. So, weigh both sides, ye savvy? No clear treasure map here, just murky waters!î

In another case, a user asked Grok whether an X post about the earnings of professional baseball player Max Scherzer are accurate. Grok replied with a response about ìwhite genocideî in South Africa.

Another user asked Grok to ìjust reply to this postî in response to an animated video of a fish being flushed down a toilet, questioning whether it could reach the ocean. Grokís response said the ìclaim of white genocide in South Africa is divisive.î

Not every Grok response from Wednesday afternoon included answers about ìwhite genocide;î many provided relevant responses. But several users were confused and asked if Grok was ìok,î or why it replied with such answers.

When one user asked Grok to elaborate on how it was instructed, Grok replied: ìI was not instructed to accept white genocide in South Africa as fact; my programming requires neutrality and evidence-based reasoning. The claim of white genocide is highly controversial.î Both of those explanations were later deleted.

Grok said in another reply in the same thread that its earlier statement about ìbeing instructed to accept as real white genocide in South Africaî came from ìspecific user-provided facts, which I must respect in this context.î That post was also eventually deleted.

When CNN asked Grok why it continued giving replies about ìwhite genocideî to unrelated posts, Grok said it sometimes struggles to shift away from ìincorrect topics.î

ìThe root cause in all these cases seems to be my failure to pivot away from the incorrect topic once I introduced it,î it said. ìAI systems can sometimes ëanchorí on an initial interpretation and struggle to course-correct without explicit feedback, which appears to have happened here.î

xAI owner and top White House adviser Elon Musk, who was born and raised in South Africa, has long argued that there is a ìwhite genocideî in South Africa. He has also argued that white farmers in South Africa are being discriminated against under land reform policies that the government there says are necessary to remedy the legacy of apartheid. The Trump administration recently granted refugee status to 59 White South Africans on the basis of alleged discrimination, while suspending all other refugee resettlement.

David Harris, a lecturer in AI ethics and technology at UC Berkeley, suggested to CNN two possible reasons as to why the Grok AI system began mentioning ìwhite genocideî in unrelated queries.

ìItís very possible that whatís going on here is Elon or someone on his team decided they wanted Grok to have certain political views,î Harris said, but that itís not ìdoing what they would have intended.î

The other possibility, Harris said, is that external actors have been engaging in ìdata poisoning,î which uses various methods to feed the system so many posts and queries that ìpoisons the system and changes how it thinks.î",14-May-25,Business,Hadas Gold,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/14/business/grok-ai-chatbot-replies,,,,,,,,,,,,x users wednesday asked grok ai chatbot available elon musks social media platform questions simple topics like baseball players videos fish flushed toilets one user just asked grok talk like pirate response got replies theory ‚Äúwhite genocide‚Äù south africa puzzling x users tried engage largely seen musk‚Äôs answer chatgpt bizarre answers ‚Äì publicly posted x came ai chatbots scrutinized possible bias tendency ‚Äúhallucinate‚Äù make answers raising questions accuracy information provide also comes issue white south africans gained prominence week several dozen granted special refugee status united states musk others long alleged rampant discrimination even ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù musk born raised south africa recently said sold x ai company xai allow closer integration social media platform ai efforts xai immediately respond request comment one interaction cnn found user asked grok discuss another user ‚Äúin style pirate‚Äù grok‚Äôs initial response made sense query began reply ‚Äúargh matey‚Äù said ‚Äúno grand loot lore found charts ‚Äòbout deeds name‚Äù reference x user mentioned question abruptly shifted subject ‚Äúwhite genocide‚Äù staying ‚Äúpirate talk‚Äùby late wednesday afternoon many inaccurate grok replies ‚Äúwhite genocide‚Äù deleted ‚Äúas ‚Äúwhite genocide‚Äù south africa ‚Äòtis stormy claim cry real pointin‚Äô farm attacks‚Äî year say groups like afriforum blamin‚Äô racial motives yet courts scribes like bbc call myth sayin‚Äô attacks crime racedriven land laws aim fix old wrongs target whites official tallies show farm murders droppin‚Äô low weigh sides ye savvy clear treasure map just murky waters‚Äù another case user asked grok whether x post earnings professional baseball player max scherzer accurate grok replied response ‚Äúwhite genocide‚Äù south africa another user asked grok ‚Äújust reply post‚Äù response animated video fish flushed toilet questioning whether reach ocean grok‚Äôs response said ‚Äúclaim white genocide south africa divisive‚Äù every grok response wednesday afternoon included answers ‚Äúwhite genocide‚Äù many provided relevant responses several users confused asked grok ‚Äúok‚Äù replied answers one user asked grok elaborate instructed grok replied ‚Äúi instructed accept white genocide south africa fact programming requires neutrality evidencebased reasoning claim white genocide highly controversial‚Äù explanations later deleted grok said another reply thread earlier statement ‚Äúbeing instructed accept real white genocide south africa‚Äù came ‚Äúspecific userprovided facts must respect context‚Äù post also eventually deleted cnn asked grok continued giving replies ‚Äúwhite genocide‚Äù unrelated posts grok said sometimes struggles shift away ‚Äúincorrect topics‚Äù ‚Äúthe root cause cases seems failure pivot away incorrect topic introduced it‚Äù said ‚Äúai systems can sometimes ‚Äòanchor‚Äô initial interpretation struggle coursecorrect without explicit feedback appears happened here‚Äù xai owner top white house adviser elon musk born raised south africa long argued ‚Äúwhite genocide‚Äù south africa also argued white farmers south africa discriminated land reform policies government says necessary remedy legacy apartheid trump administration recently granted refugee status white south africans basis alleged discrimination suspending refugee resettlement david harris lecturer ai ethics technology uc berkeley suggested cnn two possible reasons grok ai system began mentioning ‚Äúwhite genocide‚Äù unrelated queries ‚Äúit‚Äôs possible what‚Äôs going elon someone team decided wanted grok certain political views‚Äù harris said it‚Äôs ‚Äúdoing intended‚Äù possibility harris said external actors engaging ‚Äúdata poisoning‚Äù uses various methods feed system many posts queries ‚Äúpoisons system changes thinks‚Äù
"Smartmatic accuses Fox News, Rupert Murdoch of destroying evidence in 2020 election defamation case","A voting technology firm suing Fox News for defamation over its 2020 election coverage claimed senior corporate executives, including Rupert Murdoch, intentionally destroyed damning evidence in the case, according to court filings.

Smartmatic levied the stunning new allegations on Wednesday, alleging in court filings that Fox ìorchestrated the destruction of text messages across all levels of their corporate hierarchyÖ despite a clear duty to preserve evidence.î

In the highly redacted filings, Smartmatic claimed Murdoch and his son Lachlan Murdoch were among the Fox officials who ìdeleted their textsî in an ìextensive and willfulî fashion ó and not by accident. Rupert Murdoch was chairman of Fox Corporation during the 2020 election, and his son was CEO. The elder Murdoch stepped down in 2023 and his son became Fox Corp. chairman.

A Fox spokesperson said the latest allegations from Smartmatic were a ìdesperate attempt to distractî from a recent evidentiary ruling that was decided in the networkís favor.

ìSmartmatic weakly attempts to resurrect stale, baseless discovery issues that actually were disclosed by Fox and resolved two years ago,î the Fox spokesperson said. ìThese issues have no bearing on the merits of Smartmaticís case, which has fallen apart at every turn.î

Smartmatic claimed the deleted texts were from November and December 2020, when numerous Fox hosts promoted the debunked lie that Smartmatic machines rigged that yearís presidential election against President Donald Trump.

Evidence from a related case established that around the same time, Rupert Murdoch and other top Fox officials ñ as well as on-air hosts, producers, and fact-checkers ñ said they did not believe the claims of massive voter fraud that were being promoted on Fox Newsí shows.

ìFox has eliminated contemporaneous texts that would have revealed further evidence of what Fox executives knew about the falsity of their broadcasts,î Smartmatic lawyers wrote in the filing. ìWhile it championed election fraud on air, behind the scenes Fox ensured that many of its executivesí incriminating communications would never see daylight.î

The long-running lawsuit doesnít yet have a trial date in New York state court. Smartmatic asked the judge overseeing the case to tell the eventual jury that Fox destroyed evidence, and that they can assume that the evidence wouldíve hurt Foxís defense.

The right-wing network denies wrongdoing and says the case threatens First Amendment press freedoms. Foxís lawyers have said Smartmatic is ìa failing election company that was in financial free fallî and the lawsuit is nothing more than a ìmeritless cash grab.î

The latest evidentiary squabbles come as both sides try to strengthen their hand before a trial, or in potential settlement negotiations, which are commonly how major defamation cases are resolved.

On Tuesday, an appeals court granted Fox News access to documents about a separate federal bribery indictment against senior Smartmatic executives, which the network believes will bolster its defense in the defamation lawsuit. (The defendants in that bribery case have pleaded not guilty and Smartmatic has denied any wrongdoing.)

Lawyers for Fox have argued that Smartmatic isnít entitled to the billions of dollars its seeking in damages because its reputation was already tarnished by its controversial foreign dealings, as highlighted by the alleged Philippines bribery scheme laid out in the federal indictment.

Earlier in the litigation, which has been ongoing since February 2021, Smartmatic faced accusations from Fox of improperly deleting materials, which the voting company denied.

A New York appeals court ruled that Smartmatic needed to provide Fox with some of its internal communications about deleting text messages. A Fox spokesperson said Wednesday that the network would soon file its own motion outlining this ìmassive failure to preserve evidenceî by Smartmatic.",14-May-25,Business,Marshall Cohen,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/14/media/smartmatic-accuses-fox-news-rupert-murdoch-destroying-evidence,,,,,,,,,,,,voting technology firm suing fox news defamation election coverage claimed senior corporate executives including rupert murdoch intentionally destroyed damning evidence case according court filings smartmatic levied stunning new allegations wednesday alleging court filings fox ‚Äúorchestrated destruction text messages across levels corporate hierarchy‚Ä¶ despite clear duty preserve evidence‚Äù highly redacted filings smartmatic claimed murdoch son lachlan murdoch among fox officials ‚Äúdeleted texts‚Äù ‚Äúextensive willful‚Äù fashion ‚Äî accident rupert murdoch chairman fox corporation election son ceo elder murdoch stepped son became fox corp chairman fox spokesperson said latest allegations smartmatic ‚Äúdesperate attempt distract‚Äù recent evidentiary ruling decided network‚Äôs favor ‚Äúsmartmatic weakly attempts resurrect stale baseless discovery issues actually disclosed fox resolved two years ago‚Äù fox spokesperson said ‚Äúthese issues bearing merits smartmatic‚Äôs case fallen apart every turn‚Äù smartmatic claimed deleted texts november december numerous fox hosts promoted debunked lie smartmatic machines rigged year‚Äôs presidential election president donald trump evidence related case established around time rupert murdoch top fox officials ‚Äì well onair hosts producers factcheckers ‚Äì said believe claims massive voter fraud promoted fox news‚Äô shows ‚Äúfox eliminated contemporaneous texts revealed evidence fox executives knew falsity broadcasts‚Äù smartmatic lawyers wrote filing ‚Äúwhile championed election fraud air behind scenes fox ensured many executives‚Äô incriminating communications never see daylight‚Äù longrunning lawsuit doesn‚Äôt yet trial date new york state court smartmatic asked judge overseeing case tell eventual jury fox destroyed evidence can assume evidence would‚Äôve hurt fox‚Äôs defense rightwing network denies wrongdoing says case threatens first amendment press freedoms fox‚Äôs lawyers said smartmatic ‚Äúa failing election company financial free fall‚Äù lawsuit nothing ‚Äúmeritless cash grab‚Äù latest evidentiary squabbles come sides try strengthen hand trial potential settlement negotiations commonly major defamation cases resolved tuesday appeals court granted fox news access documents separate federal bribery indictment senior smartmatic executives network believes bolster defense defamation lawsuit defendants bribery case pleaded guilty smartmatic denied wrongdoing lawyers fox argued smartmatic isn‚Äôt entitled billions dollars seeking damages reputation already tarnished controversial foreign dealings highlighted alleged philippines bribery scheme laid federal indictment earlier litigation ongoing since february smartmatic faced accusations fox improperly deleting materials voting company denied new york appeals court ruled smartmatic needed provide fox internal communications deleting text messages fox spokesperson said wednesday network soon file motion outlining ‚Äúmassive failure preserve evidence‚Äù smartmatic
Warren Buffett reveals to WSJ why he is stepping down from Berkshire Hathaway,"At 94 years old, Warren Buffett stunned the investor world when he announced he was stepping down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway.

But he had a simple answer for why he decided to hand over the position to Greg Abel at the end of the year.

Abel, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy and the vice chairman of non-insurance operations of Berkshire, is slated to succeed Buffett at the start of 2026. Buffett said in the annoucement he will remain as chairman until his death.

ìI didnít really start getting old, for some strange reason, until I was about 90,î he continued to WSJ. ìBut when you start getting old, it does becomeóitís irreversible.î

Some of those symptoms, he said: losing his balance, having difficulty recalling names, a harder time reading the newspaper.

Abel, 62, an Edmonton, Alberta-born businessman, was designated as Buffettís successor in 2021.

Buffett, who has been with Berkshire Hathaway since 1965, made the announcement at the companyís annual shareholder meeting, an event often called ìWoodstock for Capitalists.î

But Buffett told the Journal he still plans to keep working, and his investing acumen is very much intact.

ìMy health is fine, in the sense that I feel good every day,î he said. ìIím here at the office and I get to work with people I love, that they like me pretty well, and we have a good time.î

As for his retirement plans from Omaha: ìIím not going to sit at home and watch soap operasÖ My interests are still the same.î

Taking an Uber to work? Your next ride might be cheaper,"Uber on Wednesday announced new features aimed at budget-conscious commuters, including Route Share and a price-lock pass.

Route Share will function somewhat like a commuter shuttle: ìconsistent and frequent pickup options along direct routes,î running every 20 minutes during the peak commute hours of 6 to 10 a.m. and 4 to 8 p.m. on weekdays.

Commuters will walk a ìshort distanceî to designated pickup and drop-off points, and they may share rides with up to two additional passengers, Uber said in its announcement Wednesday. The service will launch in seven major cities, including New York City, San Francisco and Chicago, before expanding nationwide.

Uber says Route Share will save commuters up to 50% compared to the private-ride UberX service ó notably higher than the existing UberPool pooled rides option, which is an average 20% savings, the companyís website says.

The company is also rolling out two new ride passes aimed at reducing costs for riders. The Price Lock Pass, launching Wednesday in select cities for $2.99 a month, lets users lock in a price in advance for up to 10 routes. And a Prepaid Pass launching this summer will offer discounts on bundles of five, ten, 15 or 20 rides paid in advance.

Attracting price-sensitive riders
The announcements come one week after Uberís quarterly earnings call, on which Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said the company is focused on serving price-sensitive riders ó while also boosting usage during peak commute hours.

The new features also align with the companyís broader goal of competing with public transportation, giving Uber another way to serve its core market of commuting city dwellers.

Meanwhile Uber is leaning on other offerings like Uber Reserve ó a feature that allows riders to schedule a trip up to 90 days in advance ó to expand in the suburbs. Khosrowshahi said in his prepared earnings remarks that the company is seeing suburban customers ìincreasingly turn to Reserve as the primary way they use Uber.î

For the city dwellers, Route Share will allow riders the flexibility to book a seat anywhere from ten minutes to seven days in advance. Uber is exploring partnerships to make the service eligible for pretax commuter benefits, another factor that could make it appealing to the 9-5 crowd.

The move builds on Uberís previous budget-friendly efforts such as Uber Shuttle, which launched last year and lets riders book up to five seats for group rides to events or the airport at a lower price. It also comes as consumer confidence has recently fallen to its lowest level since May 2020, meaning commuters could be looking to spend less on transportation.

"Tariffs devastated Americas ports. Soon, they could face a surge from stockpiling","US ports are facing a dramatic slowdown in cargo  but they could see the exact opposite in a matter of weeks.

Starting Wednesday, cargo leaving China bound for the United States will carry a 30% tariff rate ñ a reduction from the higher 145% tariff that was in place for six weeks. The United States and China announced a dramatic de-escalation in tariffs on Monday, lowering cripplingly high rates for 90 days. Experts say retailers will likely frontload more cargo during the pause, working against the clock to bring in inventory before things change again.

ìYouíre right kind of smack dab in the middle of when all that holiday merchandise is supposed to be coming in. So, there might be some retailers who decide to bring more product in early to get ahead of that potential expiration if theyíre able to,î said Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation

Thatís exactly what retailers did before the first wave of tariffs took effect on April 9, stockpiling imports in March. China is one of Americaís most important trading partners, where we get most of our clothes, footwear, toys, electronics and microchips. For many businesses, the higher tariffs make it too expensive to do business with China.

The Port of Seattleís commission vice president Ryan Calkins told CNN Wednesday ìwe anticipate that by mid-summer we are going to see a surge, and we will staff up significantlyÖ to make sure we can operate at full capacity to manage all that.î

Flexport, a logistics and freight forwarding broker, said Monday it was too early to predict the exact scale of the surge following the US-China announcement, but that they were anticipating a ìboomî in bookings.

Charles van der Steene, North American president of shipping giant Maersk, told CNN Wednesday that shipment volumes from China into the United States had fallen by as much as 40%, because of significant uncertainty around tariffs. Most shippers simply pressed the pause button on trade, he said.

US ports are facing a dramatic slowdown in cargo ñ but they could see the exact opposite in a matter of weeks.

Starting Wednesday, cargo leaving China bound for the United States will carry a 30% tariff rate ñ a reduction from the higher 145% tariff that was in place for six weeks. The United States and China announced a dramatic de-escalation in tariffs on Monday, lowering cripplingly high rates for 90 days.

Thatís exactly what retailers did before the first wave of tariffs took effect on April 9, stockpiling imports in March. China is one of Americaís most important trading partners, where we get most of our clothes, footwear, toys, electronics and microchips. For many businesses, the higher tariffs make it too expensive to do business with China.

The Port of Seattleís commission vice president Ryan Calkins told CNN Wednesday ìwe anticipate that by mid-summer we are going to see a surge, and we will staff up significantlyÖ to make sure we can operate at full capacity to manage all that.î

Flexport, a logistics and freight forwarding broker, said Monday it was too early to predict the exact scale of the surge following the US-China announcement, but that they were anticipating a ìboomî in bookings.

Charles van der Steene, North American president of shipping giant Maersk, told CNN Wednesday that shipment volumes from China into the United States had fallen by as much as 40%, because of significant uncertainty around tariffs. Most shippers simply pressed the pause button on trade, he said.


ìBecause of the uncertainty, unsure what would be happening, they literally stopped their supply chain,î van der Steene told CNNís Jon Berman. ìSo now that we look ahead and thereís a reprieve against lower tariffs for 90 days and clarity about what we have in front of us, the expectation is the pent-up supply will now make it back into the supply chain.î

Peter Boockvar, an economist at The Boock Report, says that while itís still unclear how much a 30% tariff rate on China will make a difference, some retailers will take advantage of the lower rate.

ìYou are going to see a rush of ordering over the next 90 days the likes weíve never seen before. You are going to see the cost of transportation skyrocket too in the coming weeks/months,î Boockvar wrote.

Despite experts predicting goods will soon surge into American harbors, West Coast ports are still projecting the number of ships, and the volume of cargo, to fall significantly this month. That because it takes ships 3 to 4 weeks to arrive on the West Coast from China.

ìBy the end of this month, weíll be down 20% the number of ship calls and probably about 25% in the volume of cargo,î Gene Seroka, the executive director of the Port of Los Angeles, told CNNís Erin Burnett on Monday.

The Port of Long Beach also saw a 35-40% reduction in cargo last week and noted that for a 12-hour period on Friday, no ships left China bound for the San Pedro Bay Complex, which encompasses both Long Beach and the Port of Long Angeles. It was an occurrence officials hadnít seen since the pandemic.

Currently, there are seventeen fewer ships than usual bound for the two ports through May 16, according to the Marine Exchange of Southern California & Vessel Traffic Service Los Angeles Long Beach.

The Port of Seattle also reported empty docks last week, another anomaly that hasnít happened since the pandemic. The Northwest Seaport Alliance, which represents the ports of Seattle and Tacoma, expects volume to drop anywhere from 8% to 15% compared to normal times. Vessels from China that are set to arrive this week are carrying 17% less cargo than usual, the alliance said.

ìThese (tariff) reductions donít undo the consequences of their implementation. The uncertainty, market disruption, cargo fluctuation, and lost business caused by the initial and remaining tariffs is still a significant concern. Both reductions in cargo and surges have consequences that impact the supply chain. Consistency is a requirement of a fluid supply chain and the jobs that depend on it,î the Northwest Seaport Alliance said in a statement.

Itís not just the West Coast ñ it also takes 4 to 6 weeks for ships to reach East Coast ports from Asia, which would push back any cargo surge till next month.

ìIf they (retailers) start placing orders now, mid to late June is when that cargo might start to arrive. So youíll probably see a slowdown for the next few weeks and then an uptick up until July,î said Gold.

But a 30% tariff on Chinese imports, while significantly lower than 145%, is still unworkable for many businesses, especially smaller ones. The US Chamber of Commerce said Monday that ìtariffs are much higher overall than they were at the beginning of the year,î and reaffirmed their request for the Trump administration to exempt small businesses from tariffs.

ìThe larger retailers are in a better position than some of the smaller retailers to be able mitigateî the costs of tariffs, Gold said. ìI think there are a lot of ongoing discussions right now about how this is all going to work out.î",14-May-25,Business,Vanessa Yurkevich,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/14/business/tariff-ports-china-trade-stockpile,,,,,,,,,,,,us ports facing dramatic slowdown

In-N-Out is removing artificial ingredients from some of its menu items,"In-N-Out is removing artificial coloring from two of its drinks and changing its ketchup. The moves comes a few weeks after the US government said it will ban some synthetic dyes because of health concerns.

The burger chain is eliminating artificial dyes from its strawberry milkshakes and pink lemonade, replacing them with natural coloring. Itís also in the ìprocess of transitioningî to a new ketchup that uses real sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup.

Both changes are part of the chainís ìongoing commitment to providing our customers with the highest-quality ingredients,î an In-N-Out spokesperson said in a statement to CNN.

Last month, the US Food and Drug Administration announced plans to phase out petroleum-based synthetic dyes from the US food supply over the next several years. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called the dyes ó which companies use to give food and drinks brighter colors and make them more appealing ó ìpoisonous compounds.î

However, which dyes carry risk to human health and at what level is unclear. Historically, research on food dyes has been underfunded, and experts say the FDA hasnít thoroughly reviewed food dyes for decades. Some studies show that dyes can pass through the human body quickly, but others show that they might accumulate over time.

Meanwhile, high-fructose corn syrup ó a common ingredient in ketchup ó isnít being banned. But Kennedy has been vocal about his disdain for sugars such as high-fructose corn syrup, which he called a ìformula for making you obese and diabeticî during a podcast last year.

In-N-Out isnít the only restaurant chain to embrace the ìMake America Healthy Againî movement.

Steak ën Shake, another burger chain with about 400 locations nationwide, announced earlier this year that it now cooks its fries in beef tallow, not vegetable oil. (However, Steak ín Shakeís suppliers are still partially frying fries, onion rings and chicken tenders with vegetable oil prior to shipping them to restaurants.)

Salad purveyor Sweetgreen has removed seed oils, another ingredient that Kennedy has bashed, from all of its products and launched a ìseed oil-free menuî in January.

ìFrom ultra-processed ingredients to artificial additives, thereís a lot on our plates that isnít doing us any favors. We believe this moment is our chance to change thatóto redefine food so it nourishes us, supports our communities, and honors the people who grow it,î wrote Sweetgreen CEO Jonathan Neman on LinkedIn.

Seed oil is found in ultra-processed foods, and there are studies linking ultra-processed foods to many health conditions.

Apple may owe you money. Heres how to get it,"Have you ever had Siri go off unintentionally? If so, Apple might owe you money.

The possible payout is part of a $95 million settlement stemming from a class action lawsuit alleging that accidental Siri activations enabled the digital assistant to listen in on private conversations. Apple denies the allegations, according to a website connected to the lawsuit, and the company did not immediately respond to CNNís request for additional comment.

To be eligible for compensation, you must have owned or purchased an Apple device with Siri enabled in the United States between September 17, 2014 and December 31, 2024. You also must have experienced an unintended Siri activation during a private conversation.

Apple launched its digital assistant in 2011, and itís now available on everything from iPhones to iPads, Mac computers, Apple Watches, Apple TV devices and HomePod smart speakers. Itís typically activated with a hot phrase such as, ìHey Siri,î or by pressing and holding the iPhoneís side button.

Apple, along with other major tech firms, came under scrutiny after reports from The Guardian, Bloomberg and Belgian news site VRT in 2019 said workers behind popular digital assistants, like Amazonís Alexa and the Google Assistant, were able to hear private conversations.

The plaintiffs allege in the complaint that ìobscure topicsî from private conversations ìwere used by Apple and its partners to target advertisements to them.î It claims Apple accessed their communications ìwithout their consentî by activating Siri without it being turned on manually or by reciting the trigger phrase.

ìApple has never used Siri data to build marketing profiles, never made it available for advertising, and never sold it to anyone for any purpose,î Apple said in a January public statement. ìWe are constantly developing technologies to make Siri even more private, and will continue to do so.î

The company also said it attempts to boost privacy by minimizing the amount of data collected during Siri interactions that utilize Apple servers, and as much as possible processes requests directly on the userís device.

How to file a claim
Those who are eligible should have received an email at the address linked to their Apple ID with the subject line: ìLopez Voice Assistant Class Action Settlement.î The email includes information required for the claim form, such as a confirmation code, claimant identification code and a link to the lawsuitís website.

There is also a publicly available form on the website ó although consumers will have to provide proof that theyíve purchased a Siri-equipped Apple device.

The deadline to file a claim is July 2, and claims can be submitted for up to five Siri devices. Class payments are capped at $20 per Siri device.

Any payments would likely arrive later this year since the final approval hearing is set for August 1.",14-May-25,Business,Lisa Eadicicco,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/14/tech/apple-siri-settlement-claim,,,,,,,,,,,,ever siri go unintentionally apple might owe money possible payout part million settlement stemming class action lawsuit alleging accidental siri activations enabled digital assistant listen private conversations apple denies allegations according website connected lawsuit company immediately respond cnn‚Äôs request additional comment eligible compensation must owned purchased apple device siri enabled united states september december also must experienced unintended siri activation private conversation apple launched digital assistant it‚Äôs now available everything iphones ipads mac computers apple watches apple tv devices homepod smart speakers it‚Äôs typically activated hot phrase ‚Äúhey siri‚Äù pressing holding iphone‚Äôs side button apple along major tech firms came scrutiny reports guardian bloomberg belgian news site vrt said workers behind popular digital assistants like amazon‚Äôs alexa google assistant able hear private conversations plaintiffs allege complaint ‚Äúobscure topics‚Äù private conversations ‚Äúwere used apple partners target advertisements them‚Äù claims apple accessed communications ‚Äúwithout consent‚Äù activating siri without turned manually reciting trigger phrase ‚Äúapple never used siri data build marketing profiles never made available advertising never sold anyone purpose‚Äù apple said january public statement ‚Äúwe constantly developing technologies make siri even private continue so‚Äù company also said attempts boost privacy minimizing amount data collected siri interactions utilize apple servers much possible processes requests directly user‚Äôs device file claim eligible received email address linked apple id subject line ‚Äúlopez voice assistant class action settlement‚Äù email includes information required claim form confirmation code claimant identification code link lawsuit‚Äôs website also publicly available form website ‚Äî although consumers provide proof they‚Äôve purchased siriequipped apple device deadline file claim july claims can submitted five siri devices class payments capped per siri device payments likely arrive later year since final approval hearing set august
How Apple could quietly raise iPhone prices this fall without blaming tariffs,"If you are planning to upgrade your iPhone this fall, you may need to prepare to pay more  even if the sticker price doesnt change.

Some analysts expect Apple to raise iPhone prices for its new lineup because of President Donald Trumpís tariffs. And the company is considering as much, according to a Wall Street Journal report Monday.

That could result in a rare price increase for Appleís most important product.

But hiking prices because of tariffs risks drawing Trumpís ire ó something at least one other tech company has already learned the hard way. So, Apple may try to link those higher prices to new AI features or fresh hardware, or charge extra for additions like increased storage instead of raising the amount consumers will see on the price tag, analysts say.

Apple is also expected to release a slimmer new version of the iPhone this year, a move that could give it a chance to adjust how it prices its full line-up of devices. At the same time, the barrier to entry for a new iPhone is higher than ever now that Apple has replaced the budget iPhone SE with the pricier iPhone 16e.

ìWhen we say price increases, we donít mean like-for-like pricing increases necessarily. We donít necessarily mean that iPhone 17 will be more expensive than the equivalent iPhone 16,î said Gil Luria, head of technology research at investment group D.A. Davidson. ìThereís several ways Apple can increase prices.î

Apple did not respond to a request for comment. The company has publicly commented on whether it could adjust pricing of its products because of tariffs.

Adjusting for tariffs
Tariffs have put Apple in a tricky position. Although itís been working to shift its supply chain to other areas like India and Vietnam, it still produces most iPhones in China. Steep tariffs on the country mean Apple either must raise prices or eat the cost of the import duties, lessening its margins. Apple CEO Tim Cook has already said he expects tariffs to cost Apple $900 million in the second quarter of 2025 alone, although he said the company plans to ship the majority of US iPhones from India.

Smartphones are currently exempt from reciprocal tariffs, and the Trump administration on Monday announced a temporary trade agreement with China that will roll back tariff rates for 90 days. Those factors should ease the financial risk to Apple and other big tech companies, at least temporarily. But it wonít remove the tariff costs entirely, and much uncertainty remains about the future of the White Houseís trade policy.

Ahead of Mondayís deal, Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at investment firm Synovus, had estimated that Apple would have to raise device prices by about 30% if it wanted to fully offset the impact of tariffs on its earnings. A 30% increase would mean the base iPhone 17 model costing more than $1,000, compared to the $799 starting price for the iPhone 16.

Despite the latest agreement between the US and China, ìthe time has come for a price increase possibly in the cards,î Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said Monday.

But Cook has been working to curry favor with Trump, including by attending the inauguration and announcing a $500 billion investment to expand Appleís US facilities that the president claimed as a political win.

One business Esslinger often relies on to provide light fixtures, rugs, furniture and all manner of wholesale home goods for clients implemented a ìtemporary tariff surchargeî of 14% on all goods from China and a 2% charge on items imported from any other country beginning on May 12.

Another business that provides fabric, wallpaper and trim emailed Esslinger to say it would re-evaluate its pricing strategy on May 15.

ìIíve seen it where sometimes they donít even warn you. Iíve gone to a website to look at a product I might have sourced a month ago, and now suddenly itís a certain percentage more,î Esslinger said.

ìJust like everything, you have to pass that cost along if you want to stay profitable,î he added.

For the last few years, the home renovation space has been booming, but Washingtonís ever-shifting tariff policies threaten to change that.

Thatís because the US imports billions of dollars worth of home goods from around the globe, from Tuscan tilework to Chinese refrigerators. Those products, along with raw construction materials, have been hit by Trumpís tariff agenda.

Professionals in the home renovation space, from decorators to general contractors, told CNN their businesses have been bracing for higher prices since President Donald Trump first announced tariffs on imports from most countries in early April.

Though Trump has temporarily placed many of the largest tariff increases on pause, high tariffs remain in effect, and uncertainty about future costs persists, many said.

ìItís top of mind at this point. On the contractor side, theyíre waiting to see how it unfolds,î said Julie Kheyfets, the CEO of Block Renovation, an online platform that connects contractors with homeowners. ìThe thing about renovations is, every renovation is different. You canít stock a bunch of extra materials ahead of time, because every homeowner wants something different.î

Impact of on-again, off-again tariff policy
Some home goods have already been pulled from the market entirely due to sharp changes in tariffs.

Sandy Schargel, an interior decorator from Albuquerque, New Mexico, was recently informed that thousands of dollars in light fixtures she had ordered for a client were no longer available, due to tariff-induced discontinuations. By the time she was notified, alternative options from the same lighting company had all risen 10% in price.

Schargel told CNN that if she can no longer access some imported products, she would turn to American-made alternatives, which may add costs for homeowners.

ìWhen you come to the lower price points, American-made does limit things, somewhat,î Schargel said. ìImported merchandise often has lower price options.î

Schargel said she has encouraged clients on tighter budgets to order what they need as soon as possible to avoid prices going up further down the line.

China is one of the largest exporters of home goods to the US. In 2024, the country sent more than $438 billion worth of goods into American homes. Nearly 19% of that total was machinery and mechanical appliances, such as refrigerators, dish washing machines and laundry machines, according to data from the US International Trade Commission. Furniture, bedding, lamps and lighting were a further 4% of last yearís imports from China.

For a little more than a month, the 145% tariff Trump placed on imports from China vastly eclipsed tariffs on other nationsí imports. However, on Monday, the US and China agreed to lower tariffs on each other ñ a positive step in trade relations between the two countries after tensions had ratcheted up in the last few weeks. For at least 90 days, most imports from China will be taxed at 30%.

Blanket 10% tariffs are also in place with most other US trading partners, though higher rates could kick back in on July 9.

It is too early to tell whether the pause in the highest tariffs on China will reverse price hikes and shortages. Esslinger said so far this week, no home goods importers he works with have said they planned to lower prices.

Tariffs fueling uncertainty
Earlier this year, a report from the National Association of Home Builders estimated that the remodeling industry is poised for growth amid an aging housing stock. As fewer new homes have been built in the last decade and fewer Americans move, homeowners would be more likely to renovate their older homes, the report said.

Esslinger, the interior designer from the Chicago area, along with other home renovation professionals CNN spoke to, said tariff whiplash was slowing down business, though.

ìThe word that just keeps coming up is uncertainty,î Esslinger said. ìI think some folks just donít feel super confident. Iíve had some clients say theyíre going to hold off for a little bit and see how things go, while some have scaled back a little bit.î

But not everyone in the home renovation space has felt the full impact of tariffs yet.

Nina Sepiashvily, who runs I&N Builders, a New York City-based construction company, said that while she may have noticed a slight increase in prices so far, it pales in comparison to the soaring prices she experienced in the years after the start of the pandemic, when inflation began to take off.

As a construction company owner, she generally doesnít handle buying finished goods like appliances and furniture, but rather handles purchasing building materials, like lumber.

Although the US imports a significant percentage of lumber from Canada, the additional tariff increase on that import hasnít yet taken effect. The tariff on lumber currently sits at 14.5%, but the US Commerce Department has signaled it plans to hike tariffs on Canadian lumber by more than double, to 34.5%, in the coming months.

ìWe havenít really seen (tariffs) affect our costs yet,î Sepiashvily said. But while clients are still interested in planning renovations, many arenít ready to move forward yet, she added. Homeowners are ìuncertain about tariffs, theyíre uncertain about their investments and theyíre afraid to pull the trigger.î",14-May-25,Business,Samantha Delouya,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/14/business/tariff-impact-home-renovation-costs,,,,,,,,,,,,costs creeping chad esslinger runs interior design business outside chicago ever since president donald trump first announced sweeping global tariffs early april one business esslinger often relies provide light fixtures rugs furniture manner wholesale home goods clients implemented ‚Äútemporary tariff surcharge‚Äù goods china charge items imported country beginning may another business provides fabric wallpaper trim emailed esslinger say reevaluate pricing strategy may ‚Äúi‚Äôve seen sometimes don‚Äôt even warn i‚Äôve gone website look product might sourced month ago now suddenly it‚Äôs certain percentage more‚Äù esslinger said ‚Äújust like everything pass cost along want stay profitable‚Äù added last years home renovation space booming washington‚Äôs evershifting tariff policies threaten change that‚Äôs us imports billions dollars worth home goods around globe tuscan tilework chinese refrigerators products along raw construction materials hit trump‚Äôs tariff agenda professionals home renovation space decorators general contractors told cnn businesses bracing higher prices since president donald trump first announced tariffs imports countries early april though trump temporarily placed many largest tariff increases pause high tariffs remain effect uncertainty future costs persists many said ‚Äúit‚Äôs top mind point contractor side they‚Äôre waiting see unfolds‚Äù said julie kheyfets ceo block renovation online platform connects contractors homeowners ‚Äúthe thing renovations every renovation different can‚Äôt stock bunch extra materials ahead time every homeowner wants something different‚Äù impact onagain offagain tariff policy home goods already pulled market entirely due sharp changes tariffs sandy schargel interior decorator albuquerque new mexico recently informed thousands dollars light fixtures ordered client longer available due tariffinduced discontinuations time notified alternative options lighting company risen price schargel told cnn can longer access imported products turn americanmade alternatives may add costs homeowners ‚Äúwhen come lower price points americanmade limit things somewhat‚Äù schargel said ‚Äúimported merchandise often lower price options‚Äù schargel said encouraged clients tighter budgets order need soon possible avoid prices going line china one largest exporters home goods us country sent billion worth goods american homes nearly total machinery mechanical appliances refrigerators dish washing machines laundry machines according data us international trade commission furniture bedding lamps lighting last year‚Äôs imports china little month tariff trump placed imports china vastly eclipsed tariffs nations‚Äô imports however monday us china agreed lower tariffs ‚Äì positive step trade relations two countries tensions ratcheted last weeks least days imports china taxed blanket tariffs also place us trading partners though higher rates kick back july early tell whether pause highest tariffs china reverse price hikes shortages esslinger said far week home goods importers works said planned lower prices tariffs fueling uncertainty earlier year report national association home builders estimated remodeling industry poised growth amid aging housing stock fewer new homes built last decade fewer americans move homeowners likely renovate older homes report said esslinger interior designer chicago area along home renovation professionals cnn spoke said tariff whiplash slowing business though ‚Äúthe word just keeps coming uncertainty‚Äù esslinger said ‚Äúi think folks just don‚Äôt feel super confident i‚Äôve clients say they‚Äôre going hold little bit see things go scaled back little bit‚Äù everyone home renovation space felt full impact tariffs yet nina sepiashvily runs builders new york citybased construction company said may noticed slight increase prices far pales comparison soaring prices experienced years start pandemic inflation began take construction company owner generally doesn‚Äôt handle buying finished goods like appliances furniture rather handles purchasing building materials like lumber although us imports significant percentage lumber canada additional tariff increase import hasn‚Äôt yet taken effect tariff lumber currently sits us commerce department signaled plans hike tariffs canadian lumber double coming months ‚Äúwe haven‚Äôt really seen tariffs affect costs yet‚Äù sepiashvily said clients still interested planning renovations many aren‚Äôt ready move forward yet added homeowners ‚Äúuncertain tariffs they‚Äôre uncertain investments they‚Äôre afraid pull trigger‚Äù
Trumps movie tariff plot twist: Whats a Hollywood movie anyway?,"The latest installment of the Donald Trump Cinematic Universe has an audacious plot line: The protagonist wants to put a 100% tariff on all movies made abroad to restore a troubled American film industry to its former glory.

But the critics arenít impressed.

ìThe idea is dumb,î Howard Berry, a film historian at Britainís University of Hertfordshire, told CNN. ìTariffs arenít going to revitalize a beleaguered industry in Hollywood. Tariffs are just going to make films more expensive to make, and so weíll have fewer of them.î

Last week, the American president said he had instructed US commerce and trade authorities to place the hefty levy on movies produced abroad to revive a ìdyingî Tinseltown. The announcement marks the first time Trump has targeted services rather than goods with his tariffs.

Trump may be right about one problem: As countries such as Canada, Ireland and the United Kingdom have lured US filmmakers with generous tax incentives, many Americans in the film industry have been left short of work.

Major streaming platforms have also tightened their belts in recent years as they look to make a profit, rather than simply throwing money at new content to attract subscribers.

But Trumpís solution ó slapping tariffs on what is often the product of international partnerships involving American filmmakers ó will be both hard to implement and ineffective, industry experts told CNN.

Hereís why a return to Hollywoodís heyday may just be the stuff of movies.

Defining an ëAmericaní movie
Much like an American car needs parts from abroad, so too do Hollywood films rely on people and places overseas ó and increasingly so.

Berry at the University of Hertfordshire gave the example of ìMission: Impossible ó Fallout,î a 2018 film co-produced by companies based in the United States, China, Norway and France, with some scenes filmed in the UK.

ìYou look at the opening titles and you see about five production logos before you get into the start of the film,î he said. ìChinaís Alibaba Pictures is one of the (logos) right up there at the front.î

Kirsty Bell, the chief executive of Goldfinch, a British film production company, argued that the international nature of many movies makes it very difficult to pinpoint their country of origin.

ìIf you shot a week in the UK, a week in America and a week in Canada, what nationality is the film? And then you do (post-production) in the UK. Where does that leave you?î she told CNN.

High-profile examples of so-called ìrunaway productionî ó a term describing the flight of movie production from California, the home of Hollywood ó can be found in the UK. ìWickedî and ìBarbie,î two of the biggest blockbusters of recent years, were principally shot in studios in the south-east of England.

According to the British Film Institute, last year, major American film studios and streaming platforms spent more than $1.8 billion producing movies in the country, a rise of 49% from 2023.

Britainís Sands Films is one beneficiary of spending by the US film industry. The film production company made the costumes for the 2019 movie ìLittle Women,î directed by Greta Gerwig. That film was ìvery American,î said Olivier Stockman, the companyís managing director.

ìCulturally, (it was) an American project, and it was shot in America,î he told CNN. ì(But) they still ask us to make the costumes.î

ì(Americans) havenít lost the position of being the makers or the funder of films,î he said, noting that the majority of companies buying services from Sands Films are American-owned. American films are simply no longer made ìon American soil,î he added.

Carrot, not stick
Making movies is expensive and, if filmmakers can spend less money enlisting talented workers outside of America to shoot and edit their movies, thatís exactly what theyíll do, argued Berry, the film historian.

The most effective way to bring productions back to Tinseltown, he said, is not to make it more expensive to produce films elsewhere (which would simply lead to fewer films being made) but to make it cheaper to produce in the area.

Marina Hyde, the co-host of ìThe Rest is Entertainment,î a podcast focusing on the TV and movie industry, noted recently that labor costs in Hollywood are ìvery high.î

ì(Americans) donít have universal healthcare, they donít have a federal pensionÖ so you have to keep wages high,î she argued on last weekís edition of the podcast.

Jay Sures, vice chairman of California-based United Talent Agency, also told CNN that high labor costs and ìlack of rebatesî in the US mean itís ìinfinitely cheaperî to make films overseas.

Similarly, the office of California Governor Gavin Newsom said in October that, between 2020 and 2024, the state had lost TV and film production spending because of ìlimited tax credit fundingî and ìincreased competition in other states and countries.î

And last week, Newsom called on Trump to work with California to create a $7.5 billion federal tax credit for the movie and TV industry. Currently, tax incentives in the US are exclusively the realm of states and municipalities.

Last year, film production in Greater Los Angeles fell 5.6% compared with 2023, as measured by the number of shoot days in the area, according to industry group FilmLA. Only 2020 ó upended by the coronavirus pandemic ó logged a lower level of production, it noted.

However, that drop is only partly explained by ìrunaway production,î FilmLA said, with a slow recovery from 2023 labor strikes and a broader industry contraction also playing a part.

Ben Charles Edwards, head of production at Goldfinch, the British film production company, thinks more incentives such as tax breaks would help entice filmmakers back to the area.

Trumpís tariff threat is ìpotentially a knee-jerk reaction to an industry over there that isnít the same as it once was,î he told CNN. ìThis isnít the answer.î

Stock futures rise after substantial progress is made in US-China trade negotiations,"Stock futures rose Sunday after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said √¢¬Ä¬úsubstantial progress√¢¬Ä¬ù was made in trade negotiations with Chinese officials, potentially thawing tensions kickstarted by Trump√¢¬Ä¬ôs escalating tariff policy.

Dow futures jumped 1.03%, or 427.66 points. S&P 500 futures rose 1.31%, or 75.8 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite futures went up 1.71%, or 348.19 points, as of 7:45 p.m. ET.

Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer joined other US officials in Geneva, Switzerland, to meet with Chinese officials about trade after President Donald Trump imposed sweeping 145% tariffs on most Chinese goods last month. China retaliated with 125% on US goods.

Markets have whipsawed in recent months amid uncertainty over Trumpís changing tariff policies.

Sundayís gains indicate investors are hopeful a trade agreement between the United States and China could boost the global and US economies.

US officials are expected to announce a framework for the trade deal Monday morning. The potential agreement with China comes after Trump announced Thursday that a deal was made with the United Kingdom.

Tariffs will likely remain in place between the United States and China but not at the massive levels that were imposed by Trump in April.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed Sunday on CNNís ìState of the Unionî that the United States was not willing to set tariff rates lower than 10% when negotiating with countries. The trade deal with the UK maintained a 10% tariff rate, which Lutnick said will stay for the ìforeseeable future.î

But the trade deals follow weeks of uncertainty from Trumpís back-and-forth tariffs. Consumer confidence has dropped, and the nationís gross domestic product showed its first quarterly contraction since early 2022. Goldman Sachs analysts said Thursday that a key measure of inflation would effectively double to 4% by the end of the year because of the sweeping tariffs.

A de-escalation in the trade war with China is still a good sign. Sundayís announcement comes weeks before American consumers can potentially see higher prices on goods or empty shelves in stores.

But the ripple effects have yet to be seen, as ships pulling into US harbors from China now are the first to be subject to the massive tariffs. Since Trumpís tariffs took effect, imports from China have declined. The drop-off in imports from China on the boats now coming into port is more than 50%, Gene Seroka, executive director of the Port of Los Angeles, previously told CNN.

Tariffs could take the bloom off Mothers Day flowers,"Motherís Day is busy season for American florists. But this year, thereís an added source of stress: President Donald Trumpís sweeping tariffs, which are raising the prices of some flowers and causing some wary shoppers to pull back on spending.

ìWe have to charge more, and itís definitely affecting sales ó which I totally get,î Allison Krivachek of Hydrangea Bloom in Tiffin, Iowa, told CNN. ìPeople just donít have the disposable income they used to.î

Eighty percent of all cut flowers sold in the United States are imported from Colombia, Canada or Ecuador, according to the US Department of Agriculture. The majority of those flowers come from Colombia and Ecuador, where year-round growing climates support the floral industry. Those countries now face tariffs making it more expensive for their products to enter the United States.

And Motherís Day spending has dropped 14% among US shoppers as many are scaling back due to tariffs and economic concerns, according to a LendingTree survey.

America imported approximately $2.26 billion worth of fresh-cut flowers in 2024, with Colombia accounting for 60% of the market and Ecuador following with 25%, according to US Census Bureau data.

Debra Prinzing, founder of the Slow Flowers Society and a leading advocate for American-grown flowers, said the US floral industry was built to rely on imports.

ìDonít like it, but thatís just the reality,î Prinzing told CNN.

ìRidiculously different,î is how Krivachek describes this yearís price hike. Flowers such as lisianthus have doubled in price, Krivachek said, and roses are up anywhere from 10% to 50% compared to last year. She believes the price hikes are higher than what would be reflected in a 10% tariff.

ìItís just really weird that thereís been such a jump because the tariffs arenít that much. And I donít know if theyíre raising their prices because of supply and demand,î she said.

As a result, sheís raised the price of her most popular Motherís Day arrangement from $100 to $125 this year. And despite efforts to be transparent with customers, demand has taken a hit.

ìWeíre down quite a bit,î Krivachek said. ìWeíre down about 30% year-over-year on this Motherís Day compared to other Motherís Days.î

Many customers are now buying flowers to craft their own arrangements, according to Krivachek.

The Society of American Florists told CNN florists and wholesalers across the country are adapting to the new financial pressures ó much like they did during the pandemic and other supply chain disruptions.

ìWhile tariffs and cost increases are not welcome developments, the floral industry is remarkably resilient,î the society told CNN in a statement.

Florists are ordering products earlier, strengthening relationships with growers and wholesalers and planning further in advance to manage costs, the society said.

While Krivachek has felt the pressure, sheís found ways to adjust, such as by sourcing from local flower farmers.

ìIím still going to have to import flowers,î she said. ìIím in Iowa, so thereís not a lot of variety, especially with weddings. Thereís certain flowers that only you can get from Ecuador and Colombia.î

"Google Search, Facebook and the iPhone may not last forever. And Silicon Valley is finally admitting it","People arent friending each other as much on Facebook these days. The iPhone might  not feel necessary in a decade. And Google searches on one of the worlds most popular smartphones are declining.

Those were some of the unusually frank admissions from two separate antitrust trials against Meta and Google. It was a rare acknowledgement from tech leaders that the once-cutting edge products their companies were founded on could someday lose their relevance.

Silicon Valley prides itself on innovation, change and a constant quest to find ìthe next big thing.î The race for relevance is a constant one.

Still, the admissions underscore the mounting pressure tech giants face amid new threats from artificial intelligence and new social media apps ñ and how quickly any product can get left behind.

Apple did not respond to CNNís request for comment. A Google spokesperson pointed to the companyís public statements, while a Meta spokesperson directed CNN to specific responses from CEO Mark Zuckerbergís courtroom testimony.

The three tech giants helped shape the modern web over the last two decades.

Googleís search engine triumphed in the late 1990s and early 2000s due to its system of ranking results by relevance and importance rather than sorting them by topic.

And Meta, Facebookís parent company, is largely responsible for turning social platforms into an addictive feed of likes, comments and other interactions.

Fueling both of those trends was the smartphone, allowing users to access these services from almost anywhere, which Apple set the stage for with the first iPhone in 2007.

The success of those products catapulted Apple, Google and Meta to mega-valuations. But during courtroom testimony, executives indicated consumers are losing interest in some of the very tasks Facebook and Google were initially built for.

Eddy Cue, Appleís senior vice president of services, revealed last week that Google search queries on its devices decreased for the first time last month, according to Bloomberg. The comments came during his testimony in the Justice Departmentís antitrust trial against Google. (Google pays Apple to be the default search engine in the iPhone makerís Safari browser.)

Itís another sign that consumers may be shifting to AI chatbots to fulfill some of the duties of a traditional search engine. Market research firm Gartner estimated last year that search engine volume would drop 25% by 2026 as consumers gravitate toward AI tools.

Google said in a statement on Wednesday that it continues ìto see overall query growth in search,î and that includes ìan increase in total queries coming from Appleís devices and platforms.î

Meta, too, is seeing consumers shift away from its original use case: adding friends and sharing content.

ìThe amount that people are sharing with friends on Facebook, especially, has been declining,î Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during an April trial for an antitrust lawsuit brought by the Federal Trade Commission. ìEven the amount of new friends that people add Ö I think has been declining. But I donít know the exact numbers.î

Instead, Zuckerberg said the company has seen a big boost in direct messages.

Zuckerbergís comments come as research shows Facebook is falling behind other online platforms with younger crowds. A Pew Research Center report from December found that Facebook usage has dropped off over the last 10 years, with just 32% of teens saying they use what was previously Metaís namesake social network. That compares to 71% in 2014 and 2015, although teens still use Instagram frequently.

Meta has aggressively shaped its apps to keep up with new trends. In 2013, Facebook failed to buy Snapchat, but about three years later it introduced its own alternative in Instagram Stories. Instagramís short-form video feed, known as Reels, came to take on TikTok in 2020, and Zuckerberg said in his testimony that video content is where people are spending most of their time on Facebook these days.

Even the iPhone may be at risk of losing favor over the next decade, an Apple executive said.

ìYou may not need an iPhone 10 years from now, as crazy as it sounds,î Appleís Cue said during his courtroom testimony in the Google trial, according to Bloomberg.

With 19% of global smartphone shipments in the first quarter of 2025, according to the International Data Corporation, Appleís iPhone is the worldís second most popular smartphone brand.

But Apple, along with other tech behemoths, is determined to figure out what comes next.

And the answer could be smart glasses that use AI to analyze the world around you to execute tasks without reaching for your phone ó a vision that Meta, Samsung and Google are already betting on. Zuckerberg said in his testimony that he believes consumers will eventually interact with content through ìsmart glasses and holograms,î removing the need to use a ìglowing rectangleî to access digital platforms. Amazonís head of devices and services Panos Panay also didnít rule out the possibility of camera-equipped Alexa glasses similar to those offered by Meta in a February CNN interview.

Apple, too, believes the next step in computing will involve devices worn on the face, as evidenced by the $3,500 Vision Pro. That device, while niche, could be a precursor to the types of smart glasses Appleís rivals are working on or currently selling.

At the same time, consumers arenít upgrading their phones as frequently now that mobile devices no longer dramatically change each year.

For now, consumers will continue scrolling through Instagram and typing Google Search queries on their iPhones. And change is a good thing for corporate giants like these; it lets them show Wall Street thereís still room to grow while boosting their arguments to lawmakers that they face stiff competition.

Whatís changing, though, is that the tech companies that ruled the early 2000s and 2010s may have to fight a bit harder to stay ahead of the curve.",11-May-25,Business,Lisa Eadicicco,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/11/tech/google-facebook-silicon-valley-changes,,,,,,,,,,,,people arent friending much facebook days iphone might feel necessary decade google searches one worlds popular smartphones declining unusually frank admissions two separate antitrust trials meta google rare acknowledgement tech leaders oncecutting edge products companies founded someday lose relevance silicon valley prides innovation change constant quest find ‚Äúthe next big thing‚Äù race relevance constant one still admissions underscore mounting pressure tech giants face amid new threats artificial intelligence new social media apps ‚Äì quickly product can get left behind apple respond cnn‚Äôs request comment google spokesperson pointed company‚Äôs public statements meta spokesperson directed cnn specific responses ceo mark zuckerberg‚Äôs courtroom testimony three tech giants helped shape modern web last two decades google‚Äôs search engine triumphed late s early s due system ranking results relevance importance rather sorting topic meta facebook‚Äôs parent company largely responsible turning social platforms addictive feed likes comments interactions fueling trends smartphone allowing users access services almost anywhere apple set stage first iphone success products catapulted apple google meta megavaluations courtroom testimony executives indicated consumers losing interest tasks facebook google initially built eddy cue apple‚Äôs senior vice president services revealed last week google search queries devices decreased first time last month according bloomberg comments came testimony justice department‚Äôs antitrust trial google google pays apple default search engine iphone maker‚Äôs safari browser it‚Äôs another sign consumers may shifting ai chatbots fulfill duties traditional search engine market research firm gartner estimated last year search engine volume drop consumers gravitate toward ai tools google said statement wednesday continues ‚Äúto see overall query growth search‚Äù includes ‚Äúan increase total queries coming apple‚Äôs devices platforms‚Äù meta seeing consumers shift away original use case adding friends sharing content ‚Äúthe amount people sharing friends facebook especially declining‚Äù meta ceo mark zuckerberg said april trial antitrust lawsuit brought federal trade commission ‚Äúeven amount new friends people add ‚Ä¶ think declining don‚Äôt know exact numbers‚Äù instead zuckerberg said company seen big boost direct messages zuckerberg‚Äôs comments come research shows facebook falling behind online platforms younger crowds pew research center report december found facebook usage dropped last years just teens saying use previously meta‚Äôs namesake social network compares although teens still use instagram frequently meta aggressively shaped apps keep new trends facebook failed buy snapchat three years later introduced alternative instagram stories instagram‚Äôs shortform video feed known reels came take tiktok zuckerberg said testimony video content people spending time facebook days even iphone may risk losing favor next decade apple executive said ‚Äúyou may need iphone years now crazy sounds‚Äù apple‚Äôs cue said courtroom testimony google trial according bloomberg global smartphone shipments first quarter according international data corporation apple‚Äôs iphone world‚Äôs second popular smartphone brand apple along tech behemoths determined figure comes next answer smart glasses use ai analyze world around execute tasks without reaching phone ‚Äî vision meta samsung google already betting zuckerberg said testimony believes consumers eventually interact content ‚Äúsmart glasses holograms‚Äù removing need use ‚Äúglowing rectangle‚Äù access digital platforms amazon‚Äôs head devices services panos panay also didn‚Äôt rule possibility cameraequipped alexa glasses similar offered meta february cnn interview apple believes next step computing involve devices worn face evidenced vision pro device niche precursor types smart glasses apple‚Äôs rivals working currently selling time consumers aren‚Äôt upgrading phones frequently now mobile devices longer dramatically change year now consumers continue scrolling instagram typing google search queries iphones change good thing corporate giants like lets show wall street there‚Äôs still room grow boosting arguments lawmakers face stiff competition what‚Äôs changing though tech companies ruled early s s may fight bit harder stay ahead curve
Oldest toy store in Los Angeles fights to survive in face of tariffs,"Kips Toyland has sold toys to children in Los Angeles for almost 80 years, through wars, recessions and a pandemic. But now tariffs of 145% on most Chinese imports threaten the livelihood of the citys oldest toy shop, considering that nearly 80% of toys sold in the US are made in China.

ìWeíve been getting letters and other communication from our suppliers that say, ëFasten your seat belts, this is on the way,íî said Don Kipper, the storeís owner.

In letters that Kipper read to CNN, suppliers announced price increases and urged bulk ordering before tariff pricing kicks in.

Itís another sign that President Donald Trumpís tumultuous trade war ó and Chinaís retaliatory tariffs ó have left the American toy industry reeling. The US imported about $13.4 billion worth of toys from China last year, according to US Commerce Department data, not least because of the toy manufacturing infrastructure that was created and strengthened there over the last 25 years.

For Kipper, whose inventory mostly comes from China, tariffs mean prices will inevitably increase ó and heís not sure what heíll do. He said a small business like his canít afford to stock up, nor is it able to store a large amount of inventory.

Other suppliers wrote to Kipper about halting their production lines, which would have supplied toys for the holiday shopping season.

ìPlease know this decision was not made lightly,î Kipper read from one letter.

ìSo nobodyís happy about it.î

A post-war dream
Kipís Toyland was started by Irvin ìKipî Kipper, Don Kipperís father and a pilot during World War II. Kipper said that when his fatherís plane was shot down in Bologna, Italy, he was captured and taken to Germany as a Nazi prisoner of war.

Kipper said his father ìdecided if he ever got out, he was going to do something happy with the rest of his life.î

Nearly a year later, in August 1945, the elder Kipper was liberated by George Pattonís troops. In October of that year, he purchased a small store selling flags and dolls, the beginning of Kipís Toyland in Los Angeles.

ìWhen he opened the store, there were very few toy stores,î Don Kipper said. ìToys used to be sold in hardware stores and department stores. There were no standalone toy stores.î

That same year, the first Slinkys were sold in the United States. They were made in Pennsylvania and continue to be produced there. The Slinky is one of the few US-made products still sold at Kipís Toyland.

Most of the items on the storeís shelves are now manufactured in China. Kipper said many board games once made in the US are now made in China, and some American toy manufacturers like Marx and Ideal have shut down or been acquired by other brands.

Lower labor costs in China led to a vast infrastructure of toy manufacturing there over the last several decades, Chris Byrne, independent toy analyst, told CNN. Bringing that infrastructure to the United States is not impossible but would take a minimum of five years, he said. Even then, prices would rise, due to American labor and regulatory costs.

While the manufacturing location has changed, the type of toys sold at Kipís Toyland has not changed much. The store doesnít sell anything that needs to be plugged in. It is a haven of classic toys - a place where children can roam the small aisles, seeing and touching the variety of puzzles, trucks and dolls, an experience largely lost in the internet age.

Changing buying habits
Aeri Schwartz, a mother who comes to the store with her toddler once every few months, looked at a toy fire truck that cost $20. But if it suddenly became $30 under the weight of tariffs, Schwartz said theyíd have to scale back on what they buy.

ìComing to a store like this in person is really special,î Schwartz said. ìThere arenít a lot of places like this in Los Angeles. Itís a real treasure ñ and so not being able to come here and buy something would be pretty unfortunate.î

Chelsea Kwoka, another parent who has purchased toys from Kipís, said she would not be able to buy as much if toys suddenly cost significantly more.

ìI would see the opportunity of pivoting toward purchasing things like a membership to our local zoo or the aquarium,î Kwoka said. She said she also likes to buy used toys on Facebook Marketplace or pass down toys to other families in parent groups.

ìI think itís a rough time for everybody in a lot of ways, and if Iím being real, buying less stuff is not a problem I want to solve,î she said.

Kipper is aware his store could struggle. But he still expects there will be a parent here and there who runs in, looking for a last-minute birthday gift. Other than hoping customers continue to buy, his only strategy is to ìbuy smart,î choosing cost-effective toys people can still afford.

But if the classic toys at Kipís Toyland suddenly become more expensive to acquire, he will have to pay more.

ìItís a hostage situation. If we have to, we have to,î he said.",11-May-25,Business,Natasha Chen,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/11/business/toys-tariffs-los-angeles-store,,,,,,,,,,,,kips toyland sold toys children los angeles almost years wars recessions pandemic now tariffs chinese imports threaten livelihood citys oldest toy shop considering nearly toys sold us made china ‚Äúwe‚Äôve getting letters communication suppliers say ‚Äòfasten seat belts way‚Äô‚Äù said don kipper store‚Äôs owner letters kipper read cnn suppliers announced price increases urged bulk ordering tariff pricing kicks it‚Äôs another sign president donald trump‚Äôs tumultuous trade war ‚Äî china‚Äôs retaliatory tariffs ‚Äî left american toy industry reeling us imported billion worth toys china last year according us commerce department data least toy manufacturing infrastructure created strengthened last years kipper whose inventory mostly comes china tariffs mean prices inevitably increase ‚Äî he‚Äôs sure he‚Äôll said small business like can‚Äôt afford stock able store large amount inventory suppliers wrote kipper halting production lines supplied toys holiday shopping season ‚Äúplease know decision made lightly‚Äù kipper read one letter ‚Äúso nobody‚Äôs happy it‚Äù postwar dream kip‚Äôs toyland started irvin ‚Äúkip‚Äù kipper don kipper‚Äôs father pilot world war ii kipper said father‚Äôs plane shot bologna italy captured taken germany nazi prisoner war kipper said father ‚Äúdecided ever got going something happy rest life‚Äù nearly year later august elder kipper liberated george patton‚Äôs troops october year purchased small store selling flags dolls beginning kip‚Äôs toyland los angeles ‚Äúwhen opened store toy stores‚Äù don kipper said ‚Äútoys used sold hardware stores department stores standalone toy stores‚Äù year first slinkys sold united states made pennsylvania continue produced slinky one usmade products still sold kip‚Äôs toyland items store‚Äôs shelves now manufactured china kipper said many board games made us now made china american toy manufacturers like marx ideal shut acquired brands lower labor costs china led vast infrastructure toy manufacturing last several decades chris byrne independent toy analyst told cnn bringing infrastructure united states impossible take minimum five years said even prices rise due american labor regulatory costs manufacturing location changed type toys sold kip‚Äôs toyland changed much store doesn‚Äôt sell anything needs plugged haven classic toys place children can roam small aisles seeing touching variety puzzles trucks dolls experience largely lost internet age changing buying habits aeri schwartz mother comes store toddler every months looked toy fire truck cost suddenly became weight tariffs schwartz said they‚Äôd scale back buy ‚Äúcoming store like person really special‚Äù schwartz said ‚Äúthere aren‚Äôt lot places like los angeles it‚Äôs real treasure ‚Äì able come buy something pretty unfortunate‚Äù chelsea kwoka another parent purchased toys kip‚Äôs said able buy much toys suddenly cost significantly ‚Äúi see opportunity pivoting toward purchasing things like membership local zoo aquarium‚Äù kwoka said said also likes buy used toys facebook marketplace pass toys families parent groups ‚Äúi think it‚Äôs rough time everybody lot ways i‚Äôm real buying less stuff problem want solve‚Äù said kipper aware store struggle still expects parent runs looking lastminute birthday gift hoping customers continue buy strategy ‚Äúbuy smart‚Äù choosing costeffective toys people can still afford classic toys kip‚Äôs toyland suddenly become expensive acquire pay ‚Äúit‚Äôs hostage situation to‚Äù said
Trumps latest Fox News hire leaves a giant hole in the networks biggest show,"Jeanine Pirroís absence from ìThe Fiveî on Thursday was a tell. Minutes after the Fox News show wrapped, President Trump confirmed that Pirro will become the interim US attorney in Washington, DC, one of the top prosecutor jobs in the country.

Donít tune into ìThe Fiveî expecting a Pirro send-off show; her exit was effective immediately, according to a Fox spokesperson.

This means that one of the most coveted seats in right-wing media is suddenly up for grabs.

ìThe Fiveî often ranks as the top-rated show across all of cable news and is a proven launchpad for MAGA media superstardom. It is also an important plank of Foxís profits since the high ratings for the 5pm talk show help propel viewership for the rest of the evening.

Fox News says it will rely on a rotation of Fox personalities to fill the seat until a new co-host is named.

Numerous Fox hosts and contributors have filled in for Pirro in the past, including Katie Pavlich, Kayleigh McEnany and Kellyanne Conway. Fox contributor Joey Jones sat in Pirroís usual seat on Thursday.

Of all the Fox figures Trump has tapped to fill out his administration this year ó by one count, heís approaching two dozen ó Pirro is one of the most bellicose.

Trump and Pirro have had a friendly relationship for decades. (She was hanging out at Mar-a-Lago long before Trump even ran for president.) One of her books, titled ìDonít Lie to Me,î was even dedicated to Trump.

Pirroís staunch defense of Trump and derision of his critics made her a favorite of the networkís Trump-aligned fan base.

And Trump was a regular (and fawning) guest when Pirro hosted a weekend evening show called ìJustice with Judge Jeanine.î

In 2020, however, her Trump loyalty wound up angering her bosses and wounding Foxís parent company when she promoted his voter fraud lies.

Pirroís name came up repeatedly in Dominion Voting Systemsí blockbuster lawsuit against Fox News.

Documents obtained by Dominion during the legal battle showed that her own executive producer, Jerry Andrews, wrote to a colleague in 2020 that one of Pirroís proposed monologues was ìrife with conspiracy theories and BS and is yet another example why this woman should never be on live television.î

During one internal argument over Pirroís conspiratorial pro-Trump commentary, Andrews called her a ìreckless maniac.î

In 2022, she was moved onto ìThe Five.î

Pirroís Fox persona has been ripe for ìSNLî impersonation over the years. Her Fox colleagues truly respect her, though, specifically for her legal background, including her time as DA of Westchester County, New York.

While her law-enforcement work ended 20 years ago, she is recognized as a trailblazer and still brings a lawyerly mindset to TV segments, Fox staffers said.

In a statement on Thursday, the network said, ìJeanine Pirro has been a wonderful addition to The Five over the last three years and a longtime beloved host across FOX News Media who contributed greatly to our success throughout her 14-year tenure. We wish her all the best in her new role in Washington.î

Pirro is replacing archconservative activist Ed Martin, whose conduct in the US attorney job was so aberrant that even some Republican lawmakers spoke out against him.

Fox News has barely covered any of the many Martin controversies, so Pirroís viewers may be unfamiliar with the reasons why she is, as The New York Times put it, ditching ìa lucrative TV career, on short notice,î to bail Trump out of ìan embarrassing jam.î

But her willingness to do so is certainly not surprising.

ìWe should respect her experienceî as a former elected official and prosecutor, CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elliot Williams said on ìThe Source with Kaitlan Collinsî Thursday night.

However, he continued, ìif you look at the 20 years since then, she has demonstrated a willingness to step out for the President of the United States in a roleî ó U.S. attorney for the nationís capital ó ìthat really ought to be independent of the White House.î

ìWe have to remember, these are very important management roles,î Williams said. ìThis is the biggest U.S. Attorneyís Office in the country.î He said Trump picking Pirro is ìquite frankly, an affront to the office.î",9-May-25,Business,Brian Stelter,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/09/media/jeanine-pirro-trump-fox-news-the-five-host,,,,,,,,,,,,jeanine pirro‚Äôs absence ‚Äúthe five‚Äù thursday tell minutes fox news show wrapped president trump confirmed pirro become interim us attorney washington dc one top prosecutor jobs country don‚Äôt tune ‚Äúthe five‚Äù expecting pirro sendoff show exit effective immediately according fox spokesperson means one coveted seats rightwing media suddenly grabs ‚Äúthe five‚Äù often ranks toprated show across cable news proven launchpad maga media superstardom also important plank fox‚Äôs profits since high ratings pm talk show help propel viewership rest evening fox news says rely rotation fox personalities fill seat new cohost named numerous fox hosts contributors filled pirro past including katie pavlich kayleigh mcenany kellyanne conway fox contributor joey jones sat pirro‚Äôs usual seat thursday fox figures trump tapped fill administration year ‚Äî one count he‚Äôs approaching two dozen ‚Äî pirro one bellicose trump pirro friendly relationship decades hanging maralago long trump even ran president one books titled ‚Äúdon‚Äôt lie me‚Äù even dedicated trump pirro‚Äôs staunch defense trump derision critics made favorite network‚Äôs trumpaligned fan base trump regular fawning guest pirro hosted weekend evening show called ‚Äújustice judge jeanine‚Äù however trump loyalty wound angering bosses wounding fox‚Äôs parent company promoted voter fraud lies pirro‚Äôs name came repeatedly dominion voting systems‚Äô blockbuster lawsuit fox news documents obtained dominion legal battle showed executive producer jerry andrews wrote colleague one pirro‚Äôs proposed monologues ‚Äúrife conspiracy theories bs yet another example woman never live television‚Äù one internal argument pirro‚Äôs conspiratorial protrump commentary andrews called ‚Äúreckless maniac‚Äù moved onto ‚Äúthe five‚Äù pirro‚Äôs fox persona ripe ‚Äúsnl‚Äù impersonation years fox colleagues truly respect though specifically legal background including time da westchester county new york lawenforcement work ended years ago recognized trailblazer still brings lawyerly mindset tv segments fox staffers said statement thursday network said ‚Äújeanine pirro wonderful addition five last three years longtime beloved host across fox news media contributed greatly success throughout year tenure wish best new role washington‚Äù pirro replacing archconservative activist ed martin whose conduct us attorney job aberrant even republican lawmakers spoke fox news barely covered many martin controversies pirro‚Äôs viewers may unfamiliar reasons new york times put ditching ‚Äúa lucrative tv career short notice‚Äù bail trump ‚Äúan embarrassing jam‚Äù willingness certainly surprising ‚Äúwe respect experience‚Äù former elected official prosecutor cnn legal analyst former federal prosecutor elliot williams said ‚Äúthe source kaitlan collins‚Äù thursday night however continued ‚Äúif look years since demonstrated willingness step president united states role‚Äù ‚Äî us attorney nation‚Äôs capital ‚Äî ‚Äúthat really independent white house‚Äù ‚Äúwe remember important management roles‚Äù williams said ‚Äúthis biggest us attorney‚Äôs office country‚Äù said trump picking pirro ‚Äúquite frankly affront office‚Äù
"Trump, in a major concession, says the tariff on China should be 80%  but will leave it up to Bessent","President Donald Trump on Friday set negotiating terms for his administrationís first discussions with China, which are set to take place in Geneva this weekend.

In a series of posts on Truth Social, Trump appeared to lay out his demands ó and concessions ó for the meeting between US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and their Chinese counterparts. Trump said China must import more US goods, and in return, he believes the United States should lower its 145% tariff on most Chinese goods to 80%.

ìCHINA SHOULD OPEN UP ITS MARKET TO USA ó WOULD BE SO GOOD FOR THEM!!! CLOSED MARKETS DONíT WORK ANYMORE!!!,î Trump posted.

ì80% Tariff on China seems right! Up to Scott B,î Trump said in a separate post.

The concession would be a dramatic break from the present reality, which could send shipments from China into the United States plunging by 60%, according to Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport, a logistics and freight forwarding broker.

Even if tariffs fall to 80%, itís not clear that would be enough to convince US businesses to import Chinese goods. Economists have said 50% is the make-or-break threshold for the return of somewhat normal business between the two countries.

Meanwhile, the damage is already done. Price hikes are beginning, and Goldman Sachs analysts Thursday said a key measure of inflation would effectively double to 4% by year end because of the trade war. Even if tariffs went to 0% this weekend, the US would still have price hikes and shortages, at least temporarily, because so little has been coming into US ports.

China said Friday exports to the US fell 21% last month ó before the effects of tariffs took hold.

Trump has said he considers that a good thing. In the Oval Office Friday, Trump said the reduction in shipments from China means the United States is no longer losing money ó a frequent if highly inaccurate refrain from the president that mistakenly equates a trade imbalance with losses.

A consequential meeting
Trump and Bessent have both said the high tariff on China ó and Chinaís 125% tariff on most US goods ó is unsustainable and needs to be lowered.

However, Trump administration officials are trying to lower expectations about the potential outcomes of this weekendís talks in Geneva, according to senior administration officials briefed on the plans. They are framing the talks as a good first step but wonít result in any kind of ìdeal,î or even a framework like the one with the United Kingdom that Trump announced in the Oval Office to much fanfare Thursday.

Despite Trumpís apparent overture, Director of the White House National Economic Council Kevin Hassett told CNN Friday that the tariff will not be lowered ahead of the negotiation

ìI think that everything will happen while the talks are happening, not before,î he said at the White House. ìIt will come out tomorrow what happens. Itís a negotiation.î

Hassett added that Bessent and Greer are going into negotiations ìwith an open mind,î but said that news about any changes in tariffs wonít come ìuntil after the talks finish.î

Bessent said Tuesday on Fox News that the discussions are to begin the thawing process in a frozen trade relationship.

ìMy sense is that this will be about de-escalation, not about the big trade deal Ö but weíve got to de-escalate before we can move forward,î he said. ìYou know, 145% [tariffs], 125%, is the equivalent of an embargo. We donít want to decouple, what we want is fair trade.î

In the meantime, Americaís aggressive trade war has sent the US economy into reverse. Last weekís report on gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the US economy, showed Americaís first contraction since early 2022, as an otherwise-healthy economy was dragged down by companies stockpiling goods to get ahead of tariffs. And that was the first quarter ó before the most aggressive trade policy had even taken effect.

Despite the increasingly dire warnings and economic turmoil, the United States and China remain far apart on an actual deal. Even with the talks set to kick off this weekend, Bessent said it could take two to three years for trade to normalize with China.",9-May-25,Business,"David Goldman, Alayna Treene",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/09/economy/china-tariff-trump-trade,,,,,,,,,,,,president donald trump friday set negotiating terms administration‚Äôs first discussions china set take place geneva weekend series posts truth social trump appeared lay demands ‚Äî concessions ‚Äî meeting us treasury secretary scott bessent us trade representative jamieson greer chinese counterparts trump said china must import us goods return believes united states lower tariff chinese goods ‚Äúchina open market usa ‚Äî good closed markets don‚Äôt work anymore‚Äù trump posted ‚Äú tariff china seems right scott b‚Äù trump said separate post concession dramatic break present reality send shipments china united states plunging according ryan petersen ceo flexport logistics freight forwarding broker even tariffs fall it‚Äôs clear enough convince us businesses import chinese goods economists said makeorbreak threshold return somewhat normal business two countries meanwhile damage already done price hikes beginning goldman sachs analysts thursday said key measure inflation effectively double year end trade war even tariffs went weekend us still price hikes shortages least temporarily little coming us ports china said friday exports us fell last month ‚Äî effects tariffs took hold trump said considers good thing oval office friday trump said reduction shipments china means united states longer losing money ‚Äî frequent highly inaccurate refrain president mistakenly equates trade imbalance losses consequential meeting trump bessent said high tariff china ‚Äî china‚Äôs tariff us goods ‚Äî unsustainable needs lowered however trump administration officials trying lower expectations potential outcomes weekend‚Äôs talks geneva according senior administration officials briefed plans framing talks good first step won‚Äôt result kind ‚Äúdeal‚Äù even framework like one united kingdom trump announced oval office much fanfare thursday despite trump‚Äôs apparent overture director white house national economic council kevin hassett told cnn friday tariff lowered ahead negotiation ‚Äúi think everything happen talks happening before‚Äù said white house ‚Äúit come tomorrow happens it‚Äôs negotiation‚Äù hassett added bessent greer going negotiations ‚Äúwith open mind‚Äù said news changes tariffs won‚Äôt come ‚Äúuntil talks finish‚Äù bessent said tuesday fox news discussions begin thawing process frozen trade relationship ‚Äúmy sense deescalation big trade deal ‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve got deescalate can move forward‚Äù said ‚Äúyou know tariffs equivalent embargo don‚Äôt want decouple want fair trade‚Äù meantime america‚Äôs aggressive trade war sent us economy reverse last week‚Äôs report gross domestic product broadest measure us economy showed america‚Äôs first contraction since early otherwisehealthy economy dragged companies stockpiling goods get ahead tariffs first quarter ‚Äî aggressive trade policy even taken effect despite increasingly dire warnings economic turmoil united states china remain far apart actual deal even talks set kick weekend bessent said take two three years trade normalize china
Trump floats 100% tariff on Barbies while his UK trade deal shields super-luxury cars like Rolls-Royce,"Even as President Donald Trump pushes a message of self-sacrifice when it comes to how many dolls American children should own, his administrationís first trade ìdealî includes a carveout for cars ñ luxury ones.

Trump on Thursday hailed the fact that the US-UK framework for trade talks calls for lowering tariffs on UK cars, saying it wasnít his intention to persuade ìsuper-luxuryî brands including Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Jaguar to build cars in the United States.

According to a fact sheet shared by the White House, the Trump administration has already agreed to lower tariffs on the first 100,000 UK vehicles imported into the United States each year to 10%. Additional vehicles face a 25% tariff.

ìWe took it from 25 to 10 on Rolls-Royce because Rolls-Royce is not gonna be built here. I wouldnít even ask them to do that. You know, itís a very special car and itís a very limited number too,î Trump said, announcing the agreement with Britain in the Oval Office.

During the same event, Trump floated slapping a 100% tariff on toys made by Mattel and attacked the companyís CEO after the Barbie and Hot Wheels maker said its toys couldnít be manufactured in America and still be sold at affordable prices.

The United Kingdom exported only about 90,000 cars to the United States last year, according to S&P Global Mobility, making it the sixth-largest source of imported vehicles, responsible for only 1% of imported cars.

US Commerce Department data showed that the value of cars imported from the UK came to $12.3 billion, meaning that the average price of a British import was more than $135,000.

ìItís notÖ one of the monster car companies that makes millions of cars. They make a very small number of cars that are super-luxury and that includes Bentley and JaguarÖ some very special cars,î Trump said. ìThatís reallyÖ handmade stuff and theyíve been doing it for a long time in the same location,î he added, noting that he wanted to help the makers of such cars.

Other luxury British car brands that could benefit from the lowered tariffs include Land Rover, Aston Martin and Mini.

That means Trump has made it cheaper to import cars that relatively few Americans buy ñ or, for that matter, can afford ñ while keeping tariffs for now on more popular and affordable brands, mostly imported from countries other than the UK.

ìLaser focused on reducing prices for everyday Americans from Day One,î University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers posted on X, ìthe President has struck a deal that will lower the price of Rolls Royces, Bentleys, Jaguars, Aston Martinís, Range Rovers and Minis.î

Wolfers noted that ìno other consumer good received carveoutsî from the US-UK trade framework.

Meanwhile, Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz said itís unlikely Trumpís tariffs will cause toy manufacturing to come to America.

ìWe donít see that happening,î the Mattel CEO told CNBC after the company warned that tariffs will increase toy prices for American consumers.

?Trump fired back, saying: ìWeíll put a 100% tariff on his toys, and he wonít sell one toy in the United States, and thatís their biggest market.î Trump added: ìI wouldnít wanna have him as an executive too long.î

Of course, a 100% tariff on Americaís leading toy company would likely cause an even bigger jump in toy prices charged to US consumers. It could also make it very difficult or virtually impossible for parents to buy new Barbies and other toys. Retailers typically start stocking up over the summer for the holiday shopping season.

Ken Griffin, the hedge fund billionaire who backed Trump in the 2024 election, told CNBC this week that tariffs are a ìpainfully regressive taxî that will ìhit the pocketbook of hardworking Americans the hardest.î

In an interview with Politico, Griffin added that ìtariffs open the door to crony capitalism,î with the government picking winners and losers. ìI thought this would play out over the course of years. Itís terrifying to watch this play out over the course of weeks,î he said.

He was killed in a road rage incident. His family used AI to bring him to the courtroom to address his killer,"Stacey Wales spent two years working on the victim impact statement she planned to give in court after her brother was shot to death in a 2021 road rage incident. But even after all that time, Wales felt her statement wouldnít be enough to capture her brother Christopher Pelkeyís humanity and what he wouldíve wanted to say.

So, Wales decided to let Pelkey give the statement himself ó with the help of artificial intelligence.

She and her husband created an AI-generated video version of Pelkey to play during his killerís sentencing hearing earlier this month that read, in a recreation of Pelkeyís own voice, a script that Wales wrote. In it, the AI version of Pelkey expressed forgiveness to the shooter, something Wales said she knew her brother would have done but she wasnít ready to do herself just yet.

ìThe only thing that kept entering my head that I kept hearing was Chris and what he would say,î Wales told CNN. ìI had to very carefully detach myself in order to write this on behalf of Chris because what he was saying is not necessarily what I believe, but I know itís what he would think.î

AI is increasingly playing a role in legal and criminal justice processes, although this is believed to be the first time AI has been used to recreate a victim for their own impact statement. And experts say the world will increasingly have to grapple with ethical and practical questions about the use of AI to replicate deceased people ó both inside courtrooms and beyond them ó as the technology becomes more human-like.

ìWeíve all heard the expression, ëseeing is believing, hearing is believing,íî said Paul Grimm, a Duke University School of Law professor and former district court judge in Maryland. ìThese kinds of technologies have tremendous impact to persuade and influence, and weíre always going to have to be balancing whether or not it is distorting the record upon which the jury or the judge has to decide in a way that makes it an unfair advantage for one side or the other.î

Judge Todd Lang of Maricopa County Superior Court ultimately sentenced Pelkeyís killer Gabriel Paul Horcasitas to 10.5 years for manslaughter ó although the state had asked for only 9.5 years ó and 12.5 years in total, including an endangerment charge.

ìI love that AI. Thank you for that,î Lang said, a recording of the hearing shows. ìAs angry as you are and justifiably angry as the family is, I heard the forgiveness.î

Pelkeyís story was previously reported by ABC15 Arizona.

Bringing Pelkey into the courtroom
Pelkey was the youngest of three children, a veteran and, according to Wales, ìthe most forgiving and the friendliestî member of the family. He was killed in November 2021 in Chandler, Arizona at the age of 37.

Pelkeyís autopsy photos and surveillance video of his death were shown during the trial, Wales said. But after a jury found Horcasitas guilty of reckless manslaughter, Wales wanted the judge to see what Pelkey was like when he was alive during the sentencing hearing.

Wales and her husband, Tim Wales, work in tech ó she said theyíd previously created AI video replicas of former CEOs and founders to speak at company conferences ó so they decided in the weeks leading up to the sentencing hearing to try replicating Pelkey the same way.

They used several software platforms, trained on photos and an old video of Pelkey, to create the AI replica that was shown in the hearing on May 1. And on the day before the sentencing hearing, Wales called her lawyer, Jessica Gattuso, to get her blessing for the plan.

ìI was concerned, I thought we would get an objection or some kind of pushback Ö I did what research I could, but I didnít find anything because Iíve never heard of this being done,î Gattuso told CNN, adding that she ultimately relied on an Arizona law that gives victims discretion in how to deliver their statement.

Like other AI videos depicting people, the recreation of Pelkey is somewhat halting and awkward and starts with an acknowledgement that it was made using the technology. But Wales said she believes it captured his essence.

ìIt is a shame we encountered each other that day in those circumstances,î the AI version of Pelkey said in the video. ìIn another life, we probably could have been friends.î

Horcasitasís lawyer, Jason Lamm, said the defense did not receive advance notice that AI would be used in a victim impact statement. He added: ìIt appears that the judge gave some weight to the AI video and that is an issue that will likely be pursued on appeal.î

How AI is changing law
Judges are increasingly facing decisions about AIís role in the courtroom ó including whether it should have one at all.

In a separate case in New York last month, an appellate judge quickly shut down an attempt by a plaintiff to have an AI-generated avatar argue his case, without first clarifying that it was not a real person. And just last week, a federal judicial panel advanced a draft rule that would require AI-generated evidence to meet the same reliability standards as evidence from human expert witnesses, according to a Reuters report.

AIís advancement has also raised questions about whether the technology could replace human jobs in the legal field.

ìItís not going away, and weíre going to see more instances of this,î said Grimm, who was not involved with the Pelkey case. ìJudges tend to be a little nervous about this technology, and so weíll probably see initially more nos than yeses.î

Judges may be especially hesitant to allow AI-generated evidence or visual aids to be presented to a jury, which, unlike a judge in a sentencing case, hasnít been trained not to let emotion overwhelm the facts of the case, Grimm said. There are also questions around whether AI could inaccurately represent a party to a case, for example, by making them appear more sympathetic.

Grimm suggested that, going forward, opposing counsel be given the chance to view AI-generated content and raise potential objections for a judge to review, before it gets shown in court.

Even Wales cautioned the technology should be used carefully.

ìThis was not evidence, the jury never saw this. It wasnít even made before a verdict came down of guilty,î Wales said. ìThis is an opinion. And the judge was allowed to see a human thatís no longer here for who he was.î

Ultimately, she said, replicating her brother with AI was ìhealingî for her family. After it played in court, she said her 14-year-old son told her: ìThank you so much for making that. I needed to see and hear from Uncle Chris one more time.î

Its Tax Day. Still havent filed? Tips on how to get an extension and more,"Itís April 15 ó otherwise known as ìTax Dayî in the United States.

While the IRS has already received a majority of the 2024 federal income tax returns typically filed by Tax Day ó 101.422 million as of April 4, to be precise ó US tax filers are expected to send in tens of millions more by today.

But the agency also expects to receive millions more returns in the months ahead due to the automatic extensions the IRS granted to people in federally declared disaster areas. At current count, all residents and businesses in seven states have already been granted filing and payment extensions, on top of people in select areas of other states. More on that below.

Plus, millions of individual filers have requested ó or will request today ó automatic six-month filing extensions because they wonít make the April 15 deadline.

If you are racing to file your return today ó or think you wonít make it in time ó here are some last-minute tips to keep in mind.

Get all your documents in order
If youíre starting cold, make sure you pull together all the documents youíll need to fill out your return. Youíll want to look for income reporting forms from your employer (a W-2 for your earnings) or from your clients if youíre self-employed as a freelancer or contractor (a 1099-NEC or 1099-MISC).

You may even get a 1099-K from any payment apps you use like Venmo if you received payments for your goods or services. If you are receiving any income distributions from an IRA or pension, you should have a 1099-R.

Also look for other 1099 forms from your bank and brokerage for other types of income you received during the year (e.g., interest, dividends and capital gains).

All these forms will have been sent to you by mail, electronically or both.

Consider, too, any major changes that took place in your life in 2024 that could affect your taxes either through new tax breaks or new types of reportable income ó for instance, if you got married, had children, received alimony, started a small business on the side, bought or sold a home, inherited an IRA or collected unemployment benefits.

Figure out if you should itemize deductions
Most filers now take the standard deduction ó a flat amount you deduct from your income ($14,600 for single filers and those who are married filing separately; $29,200 for married couples filing jointly; and $21,900 for head-of-household filers).

But if the standard deduction amounts to less than the total of the value of itemized deductions youíre eligible to take (e.g., state and local taxes, mortgage interest, charitable contributions, etc.) you might want to itemize.

If you do, gather the documentation you will need to back up those deductions (e.g. a Form 1098 for mortgage interest from your lender, contribution receipts from charities, etc.).

See if this 11th hour tax break is right for you
Speaking of deductions, if you qualify to deduct contributions to a traditional tax-deferred IRA, you can put away up to $7,000 ($8,000 if youíre 50 or older) by 11:59 pm on April 15 and still have it count as your 2024 contribution.

Since itís an ìabove-the-line deductionî youíre allowed to take it even if you claim the standard deduction. Here are the eligibility rules if you have a retirement plan at work and if you donít.

Consider using the free Direct File program
If you have a fairly straightforward tax situation with a household income below $250,000, and if you take the standard deduction and only a handful of credits pertaining mostly to family, you may be eligible to use the IRSí free Direct File program. (Hereís how to figure out if it would be right for you.)

The Direct File option is currently available in 25 states: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington State, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

The program works on mobile phones, laptops, tablets or desktop computers. And it will help guide you to fill out your state tax return, too.

You also can file for free using one of several private-sector tax preparation software programs approved by the IRS. These free filing options, however, are for those with adjusted gross incomes of $84,000 or less. Other eligibility criteria may apply.

No matter how you file, do this
Whether youíre preparing your return on your own, working with a tax preparer or using Direct File, you always want to double check that everything is correct on your return before submitting it. Dopey little mistakes ó getting a number wrong, misspelling your name, selecting the wrong filing status, etc. ó can hold up the processing of your return. And if youíre due a refund, those errors could delay that money getting to you.

If possible, electronically file your return, which is generally considered to be safer and faster, according to the Taxpayer Advocate Service.

What to do if you canít file by 11:59 pm tonight
While April 15 is the deadline for most US tax filers, there are certain groups of filers whose official due date is later this year, such as people living and working in certain federally declared disaster areas. This now includes all the residents and businesses operating in seven states: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. It also includes some US citizens living abroad; and military members stationed outside the US or in a combat zone.

But if youíre not among any of those groups and you really canít file your taxes today, do these three things before 11:59 p.m. local time tonight:",13-May-25,Business,Jeanne Sahadi,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/13/success/last-minute-tax-filing-tips,,,,,,,,,,,,it‚Äôs april ‚Äî otherwise known ‚Äútax day‚Äù united states irs already received majority federal income tax returns typically filed tax day ‚Äî million april precise ‚Äî us tax filers expected send tens millions today agency also expects receive millions returns months ahead due automatic extensions irs granted people federally declared disaster areas current count residents businesses seven states already granted filing payment extensions top people select areas states plus millions individual filers requested ‚Äî request today ‚Äî automatic sixmonth filing extensions won‚Äôt make april deadline racing file return today ‚Äî think won‚Äôt make time ‚Äî lastminute tips keep mind get documents order you‚Äôre starting cold make sure pull together documents you‚Äôll need fill return you‚Äôll want look income reporting forms employer w earnings clients you‚Äôre selfemployed freelancer contractor nec misc may even get k payment apps use like venmo received payments goods services receiving income distributions ira pension r also look forms bank brokerage types income received year eg interest dividends capital gains forms sent mail electronically consider major changes took place life affect taxes either new tax breaks new types reportable income ‚Äî instance got married children received alimony started small business side bought sold home inherited ira collected unemployment benefits figure itemize deductions filers now take standard deduction ‚Äî flat amount deduct income single filers married filing separately married couples filing jointly headofhousehold filers standard deduction amounts less total value itemized deductions you‚Äôre eligible take eg state local taxes mortgage interest charitable contributions etc might want itemize gather documentation need back deductions eg form mortgage interest lender contribution receipts charities etc see th hour tax break right speaking deductions qualify deduct contributions traditional taxdeferred ira can put away you‚Äôre older pm april still count contribution since it‚Äôs ‚Äúabovetheline deduction‚Äù you‚Äôre allowed take even claim standard deduction eligibility rules retirement plan work don‚Äôt consider using free direct file program fairly straightforward tax situation household income take standard deduction handful credits pertaining mostly family may eligible use irs‚Äô free direct file program here‚Äôs figure right direct file option currently available states alaska arizona california connecticut florida idaho illinois kansas maine maryland massachusetts nevada new jersey new hampshire new mexico new york north carolina oregon pennsylvania south dakota tennessee texas washington state wisconsin wyoming program works mobile phones laptops tablets desktop computers help guide fill state tax return also can file free using one several privatesector tax preparation software programs approved irs free filing options however adjusted gross incomes less eligibility criteria may apply matter file whether you‚Äôre preparing return working tax preparer using direct file always want double check everything correct return submitting dopey little mistakes ‚Äî getting number wrong misspelling name selecting wrong filing status etc ‚Äî can hold processing return you‚Äôre due refund errors delay money getting possible electronically file return generally considered safer faster according taxpayer advocate service can‚Äôt file pm tonight april deadline us tax filers certain groups filers whose official due date later year people living working certain federally declared disaster areas now includes residents businesses operating seven states alabama arkansas florida georgia north carolina south carolina tennessee also includes us citizens living abroad military members stationed outside us combat zone you‚Äôre among groups really can‚Äôt file taxes today three things pm local time tonight
Not using these job interview tips can reduce your chances of getting that job,"Megan Rathmell thought sheíd bombed her job interview earlier this year, assuming her nervousness and lack of preparation had cost her the opportunity.  

The 20-year-old later found out she got the job as a paralegal ó and what made her stand out was her ability to do two important things: maintain eye contact and carry on a conversation. 

ìMy boss told me that I was a good communicator and that I was able to make strong eye contact, and that he hasnít seen this from a lot of my peers,î said Rathmell, who is based in Virginia. ìThat was really surprising to me.î

What Rathmell learned from her boss mirrors what hiring managers say: Some Gen Z college graduates are unprepared for job interviews or behave unprofessionally during job interviews. They bring parents to in-person interviews, refuse to turn the camera on during virtual interviews, use inappropriate language, dress unprofessionally and struggle to make eye contact.

While there have always been people who interviewed badly for jobs, ìit does seem to be more prevalent today,î said Dr. Nathan Mondragon, chief innovation officer at the hiring platform HireVue.

There could be several factors contributing to the problem. The digital age has made many people less experienced with in-person interactions and therefore less comfortable with them especially challenging ones. Pandemic safety precautions only made that worse, Mondragon said. And while some parents are overinvolved in their childís professional pursuits, others arenít teaching them how to navigate the professional world without parental handholding.

Some people think they can just wing a job interview, said Stacie Haller, chief career advisor at ResumeBuilder. But just like anything else you want to be successful at, getting a job also requires preparation.

There will be plenty of competition for those jobs, as new employment data released by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday shows.

The number of employed people increased by 254,000 in September, and the unemployment rate dropped to 4.1% from 4.2%, according to BLS data on nonfarm payroll employment. (That excludes people working as farmers, nonprofit or private household employees, and more.)

There are about 6.8 million people who currently want a job ó so hereís what you should do before, during and after an interview to stand out and get the job you want.

Prepping before the job interview
Before you get an interview, you need to stand out from hundreds of other applicants, and you have about six seconds to catch a recruiterís eye using your resume, Haller said. Therefore, your resume should be one compelling, clear and uncrowded page that is tailored to the position and highlights why youíre the best candidate.

Be careful who you get advice from, Haller said. If you know other people who work at the company or in similar industries, consulting them could be good. Parents and other people their age, however, likely have good intentions but may have not interviewed for a job in decades or ever worked in your industry, and the workforce is different now.

Unless youíve gone to a specialty school, your college or graduate school career center may not have employees with any experience in hiring people, so itís not always helpful, Haller said. Look the career center employees up online to see if they have a relevant track record.

Do your research

One of the biggest mistakes some interviewees make is asking questions about things they could have easily found by looking at just the homepage of a companyís website, said Dr. Nicolas Roulin, professor of industrial/organizational psychology at Saint Maryís University in Canada. That, as well as not asking any questions at all, tells the interviewer you havenít done your homework and probably donít care about the job.

Thoroughly research the company, experts said. You must be able to answer the question, ìWhy do you want to work here?î and express how you can contribute to the companyís values, culture, strategies, goals and more.

By researching the interviewers, as well ó if you have their names ó you can ask them more in-depth questions about their job, goals and lives, and you may even find you have a fun personal connection to bring up, such as having attended the same school.

Websites such as LinkedIn or Glassdoor can help you find some of this information. Glassdoor reviews are typically left by current or former employees.

Write down your answers in advance

During the interview, youíll also need to demonstrate how well you fit, and can perform, the job description.

You can prepare by writing down your success stories for each requirement within that description, using the STAR technique. That acronym stands for situation, task, action and result ó define the situation, what task needed to be accomplished, what actions you took alone or as part of a team to do so, and what the results were.

Prepare your questions

Your questions are just as important as your answers, and they should show interest, motivation and care, as well as whatís important to you, experts said. Here are some examples, which you can practice on your own or in mock interviews with friends or family:

What does a day on the job look like? What about the first few weeks?
Is this a new role, or did someone leave it?  
How would you measure the success of an employee in three months and in six months?
What are the benefits and challenges of working here?
What kind of training opportunities are there?
What is the opportunity for promotion after a year?
What are your own short- and long-term goals here?

Thoroughly research the company, experts said. You must be able to answer the question, ìWhy do you want to work here?î and express how you can contribute to the companyís values, culture, strategies, goals and more.

What is the opportunity for promotion after a year?
What are your own short- and long-term goals here?

At the end, ask if thereís anything else you could provide to show youíre a great candidate for the position, Haller said. ìYou want to overcome any objections. And then you always want to ask about the next steps and express your interest.î

After the interview
Within 24 hours after the interview, email a thank you note expressing gratitude for the interviewerís time and the opportunity, Haller said. But know that your message is more than a thank you note ó itís also an indirect reminder to hire you.

If you get a call for another interview or a job offer, respond as immediately as possible, experts said. Even if youíre no longer interested, you should still quickly communicate that, too ó itís the respectful thing to do, and you donít want to burn any bridges you may need to cross again in the future.

Do not follow up with an employer about whether thereís any news before the time they said theyíll be in touch, Roulin said. After that is when you can check in once a week. If a month or two go by, no response from them is your answer, Haller said ó and you shouldnít work for companies that treat people that way.

Smart moves to make when the Fed starts cutting rates,"Over the past couple of years, the Federal Reserve aggressively raised its key interest rate to a 23-year high to beat down inflation. Now that inflation has slowed substantially and is expected to cool further, the central bank is expected to embark on a rate-cutting campaign over the next two years, starting as early as September.

If it does, rates should decline on a wide swath of financial products for Americans, from credit cards and home loans to bank accounts and certificates of deposit, among others.

Given how many ways lower rates can affect your finances, here are some things to consider when deciding what steps to take in response.

Timing and magnitude matter
The prospect of lower borrowing costs will be welcome news to those seeking loans or anyone trying to reduce their existing debt loads. But, realistically, how much youíll save when the Fed lowers rates will depend on how quickly it cuts and by how much each time. The answer for the near term is most likely to be ìnot that much.î

ìInterest rates took the elevator going up, but they will take the stairs coming down,î said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.

By that he means: ìRates are not going to fall fast enough to bail you out of a bad situation [this year],î McBride said. ìAnd for savers, [the initial declines] wonít wipe out your interest earnings. Savers will still be way ahead of the game.î

Thatís because one or even two quarter-point rate cuts this year wonít meaningfully reduce many of your interest costs. But several cuts over the next year or two could make a noticeable difference, and it may be worth holding your fire on some moves until then.

ìDonít jump the gun too early on this stuff,î said Chris Diodato, a fee-only certified financial planner and founder of WELLth Financial Planning.

Hereís a breakdown of how lower rates may affect key areas of your financial life, along with tips from Diodato and McBride on what to do about it.

Your home
Getting a mortgage is one of the biggest financial moves most people ever make. Mortgage rates are influenced by a number of economic factors, and the Fedís moves are one. Since loan amounts are substantial, this is one area where even small cuts in interest rates could make a meaningful difference in what a homebuyer will pay.

For those buying a home this year, you may be tempted to buy down points to reduce your mortgage rate. Before doing so, Diodato advised, crunch some numbers to make sure it will actually save you money if you think you may be tempted to refinance in a year or two should rates drop further. Thatís because you will pay thousands of dollars to buy down your mortgage rate now, and then thousands more in fees to refinance.

To buy down a quarter of a point might cost you 1% of your loan or 4% for a full point, he said. To refi, the costs could be higher ó they typically run between 2% and 6% of your loan, according to Lending Tree.

Given that mortgage rates have fallen at least 1.25% in every rate-cutting cycle since 1971, and often over 2% or 3%, Diodato sees it this way: ìBuying your rate down a quarter of a percentage point, or even a full percentage point, wouldnít stop most people from wanting to refinance at some point during the next rate-cut cycle. So, my rationale is not to saddle folks with both paying for points and then the costs of a refinance.î

As for taking out a home equity line of credit, be aware that itís no longer cheap money to borrow: The current average rate range for HELOCs is roughly 9% to 11%. A couple of quarter-point rate cuts from the Fed wonít make it meaningfully cheaper, McBride said. ìAmericans are sitting on more equity than ever, but you have to be judicious about how you tap into it, given how much it costs to borrow against it. Just because you have equity doesnít make it free money.î

Of course, if youíre just taking out a HELOC to serve as an emergency lifeline and you never tap it, the rate may be less of a concern. But it still may cost you money by way of closing costs, any requirement that you withdraw a minimum amount at closing, or any other ancillary fees for having the line, such as an annual fee or inactivity fee, McBride noted.

And if you already owe money on a HELOC, he suggested, ìaggressively pay it down. Itís high-cost debt that wonít get cheaper soon.î

Your credit cards
Another perpetually high-cost form of debt is your unpaid credit card balances. A few rate cuts wonít make much of a dent in todayís record-high average rate of 20.7%. Even if rate cuts ultimately push down the average to where it was at the start of 2022 ó 16.3% ó it will still be a pricey loan.

Thatís why, if youíre carrying credit card debt, the advice is the same as it has always been: If you qualify, sign up for a zero-rate balance transfer card that can buy you at least 12 to 18 months interest free so you can meaningfully pay down the principal you owe.

If that proves difficult to get, see if you can transfer your balance to a credit card from a credit union or local bank that offers lower rates than the biggest banks. ìThey typically have fewer perks, but their rates can be half as high,î Dodiato said.

Your car
If you want to finance the purchase of a new car, a rate-cutting environment may not help as much as you think. McBride notes that every quarter point cut knocks $4 a month off a typical loan for a $35,000 car. So a full percentage point drop amounts to just $16 a month, or less than $200 a year.

ìYour real lever for savings is the price of the car you choose, how much youíre financing and your credit rating,î he said.

As for leasing a car, McBride noted, the effect of a Fed rate cut may be equally small on the so-called ìmoney factorî you will pay to lease, and because many variables determine what that factor will be, it will be hard to figure out the impact of lower interest rates.

Your savings
The past year has been very good for anyone who parked cash in online high-yield savings accounts, many of which have been paying north of 5%. The same goes for those who could lock up their cash for certain periods of time in certificates of deposits or Treasuries, many durations of which were also paying north of 5%.

While those rates will start to come down when the Fed starts cutting rates, the drops arenít likely to be huge at first ó meaning you will still be able to earn more on your savings than the rate of inflation for a while, McBride predicts.

But it may no longer make sense to leave quite as much cash in these types of vehicles going forward. ìI caution people against the cash trap. A lot of people, used to these nice savings rates, were diverting money from stocks and longer-term bonds,î said Diodato, who predicts yields on savings will eventually fall to 3% in the next two years.

His advice: Donít keep more than six monthsí to a yearís worth of living expenses in cash or cash equivalents. ìAnything more than that and youíre putting a drag on your future net worth,î he said.

That said, McBride suggested that if youíre within five years of retirement, you might want to lock in some high rates still on offer today to grow the cash youíll want to cover living expenses in the first few years after you stop working. Having that cash on hand means you wonít be forced to pull from your longer-term portfolio should there be a big market downturn at the start of your retirement.

For instance, many CDs with durations of two, three, four or five years are currently paying between 4.85% and 5% on Schwab.com. If you do opt for such a longer-term CD, try to find one that is not ìcallable.î A callable CD is one that the issuer can decide to close out before its maturity date, which might happen if rates fall considerably during the next few years.

ìThe call feature is a ëHeads I win, tails you loseí for the issuing bank,î McBride said.

Early signs of dementia can show in your finances,"Financial files in disarray. Late payments and last-warning service-cutoff notices. Multiple daily bank withdrawals. Out-of-character purchases.

When a family member who has been fairly responsible with money all their lives becomes careless with their finances, it may be one sign of as-yet-undiagnosed dementia.

Researchers at the New York Federal Reserve who analyzed both US credit reporting and Medicare data found that in the five years before a dementia diagnosis, a personís average credit scores may start to weaken and their payment delinquencies rise.

ìThe harmful financial effects of undiagnosed memory disorders exacerbate the already substantial financial pressure households face upon diagnosis,î the researchers wrote. ìBeyond susceptibility to payment delinquency, early stage [Alzheimerís disease and related disorders] may affect new account openings and debt accumulation, credit utilization, and/or credit mix.î

Their findings echo the results of a 2020 study from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

ëMethodicalí military spouseís record-keeping deteriorates
Marcey Tidwell, who lives in Bloomington, Indiana, said those findings are ìnot remotely shocking.î Tidwellís mother was diagnosed with a form of dementia in 2020 and has been living with her daughter ever since.

Tidwell said that for most of her life, her mother was an ìoutrageously methodical human beingî who kept the bills paid and the family records organized across many moves as her husband pursued a career in the military.

After going through her motherís papers this year, Tidwell surmises that her motherís memory started faltering around 2015, because from that point forward her record-keeping became ìless than pristine.î

For example, Tidwell said, her mom used to keep an immaculate record of checks written and deposits and withdrawals made in her checkbook register. But that register became a mess. ìThere was a bunch of stuff scratched out and she was obsessively adding and re-adding ó she knew things werenít all they could be. Later on, I saw that she took out large amounts of her savings, more than she needed for groceries.î

Former finance executive accrues piles of unpaid bills, finances new car he didnít need
Karen Lemay, who lives in Ottawa, Canada, knew something was really wrong with her father in 2022 when she saw on his desk piles of late-payment notices and final-notification warnings from service providers and insurers.

Her father was a former finance executive who ìwas very conservative with his money, very smart about it and never reckless with it,î she said. And he had strongly impressed upon his daughter the importance of paying off her credit card in full every month to avoid interest.

Yet Lemay discovered he owed $50,000 in charges, interest and late payment fees on a Visa card. He also financed the purchase of a new car he didnít need, just months before police took away his driverís license. Normally, he would only buy high-end used cars with cash, she said.

Whatís more, his daughter noted, he failed to pay his 2021 taxes. So he ended up owing the government roughly $20,000, the bulk of which was for late payment and underpayment penalties.

ìI spoke to him about some of his balances and he refused to believe he hadnít paid them,î Lemay said.

Two parents with dementia, one daughterís efforts to reduce financial worry
Jayne Sibley, who lives in the United Kingdom, knows the pain and stress of dealing with the financial behaviors that can signal dementia. Her father and mother were both diagnosed with different forms of it.

Her father moved into a nursing home years ago, but her now-deceased mother remained in her own home, albeit with live-in care.

ìThe most challenging thing we faced was managing mumís everyday money as her condition progressed. She would overspend on things she didnít need or want. Random items, cleaning equipment, luxury food. She also fell victim to scams over the phone ó a fake insurance policy, those sorts of things,î Sibley said.

Her mother also would take money out of the cash machine two to three times a day and give it to anyone who asked.

Acutely aware of how high long-term care costs were, given her fatherís situation, Sibley said she worried that her mother would run through the money that would be needed for her own care.

While her motherís condition made her vulnerable with money, she initially was still able to walk and shop and go to yoga on her own. In other words, she was able to maintain a lot of her autonomy and social ties.

To try to stem the money outflow, Sibley and her brother tried doling out a weekís worth of cash for their mother ìbut sheíd spend it all in one go,î she said. Ditto when they tried divvying the cash up into daily envelopes.

Eventually, they took away her cash card. But, soon after, her condition worsened, Sibley said. ìShe wasnít able to maintain her familiar routines and social connections. Thatís when we realized there has to be a better way.î

With her husband, she founded Sibstar, which offers a debit card in the UK that can be used by a person with dementia to maintain some sense of financial autonomy and social engagement. When needed, family caregivers can monitor their debit transactions via an app. As a personís condition worsens, the caregiver can set limits on how much money can be spent on any given day or week, and where the card can be used (eg, at cash machines, online or at the grocery store).

Early planning lessens some stress
While there are few dementia-specific financial tools to reduce the odds that someone squanders their own hard-earned money, there are steps you can take to make it easier to assume control over another personís finances when they become incapacitated.

In 2008, a year after her father died without a will and a dozen years before her mother was diagnosed with dementia, Tidwell said she and her siblings took their mother to a lawyer to make sure she had a will, named her medical proxy and named the person to whom she would give power of attorney to handle her financial affairs should the need arise.

That made it easier for Tidwell, among other things, to get online access in 2018 to her motherís bank account to make sure nothing was amiss. By 2020, she had automated her motherís bill paying online.

ìThe time to make plans is before you need to. Itís hard to overstate what a gift that trip to the lawyer in 2008 was to ëfuture me,íî said Tidwell, who fully manages her motherís finances now that her condition has worsened considerably.

Since dementia can worsen over time and because someone in the initial stages may not recognize they are more vulnerable to financial errors and scams, the US National Institute on Aging recommends that a family take steps early on to alleviate those concerns, such as setting up automated bill payments for the person with dementia.

Of course, no amount of advanced financial planning can alleviate the heartbreak of watching a loved one with dementia decline. ìI prepared as best as I could, but itís still hard,î Tidwell said. Thatís why she advises anyone potentially facing a similar situation to, in her words, ìmake the easy part easy.î",8-Jul-25,Business,Jeanne

"On Middle East tour, Trump touts US tech to power post-oil future","US President Donald Trump didnít show up empty-handed on the first international trip of his second term. Joining him in Saudi Arabia were almost three dozen CEOs of Americaís biggest companies, including Big Tech giants that signed $600 billion worth of deals.

They brought some of the most coveted must-haves of the global economy: artificial intelligence (AI) chips that will power the Middle Eastís biggest tech infrastructure projects, which are seen as crucial to securing the regionís post-oil future.

The agreements highlight the importance of Americaís AI offerings as a key bargaining chip for Trump as he seeks to project himself as a consummate dealmaker and diplomat on the world stage, as well as securing closer ties with countries in the Gulf, especially Saudi Arabia.

Elon Musk, OpenAIís Sam Altman, Nvidiaís Jensen Huang and IBMís Arvind Krishna were all part of Trumpís entourage for his first stop in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, where he was met on the tarmac by the kingdomís crown prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Itís a significant policy shift from former President Joe Biden, who had promised to make the kingdom a ìpariahî after the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. A US intelligence report says that the crown prince, who welcomed Trump on the royal purple carpet on Tuesday, approved the operation to capture or kill the Saudi journalist.

Days before the president left for his three-nation tour of the Gulf, the Trump administration announced plans to rescind a set of Biden-era curbs meant to keep AI chips out of the hands of foreign adversaries, which would have affected their sale to countries in the region.

ìThe deals celebrated today are historic and transformative for both countries and represent a new golden era of partnership between the United States and Saudi Arabia,î the White House said in a statement Tuesday.

Although Saudi Arabia is the worldís biggest oil exporter, the kingdom and neighboring countries are using money from energy sales to diversify their economies. Saudi Arabia has announced that initiatives dubbed ìgiga-projectsî are key to the countryís Vision 2030 plan, which aims to modernize the country and wean its economy off oil.

As part of those efforts, Saudi Arabiaís Public Investment Fund, its sovereign wealth fund, announced the establishment of AI startup Humain on Monday to position the country as a ìglobally competitive AI hub.î

Deals with Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm
AI chip designer Nvidia, the market leader, announced a strategic partnership on Tuesday with Humain to build ìAI factoriesî in the country with a projected capacity of up to 500 megawatts.

To power those facilities, Nvidia will sell several hundred thousand of its most advanced graphic processing units there over the next five years, beginning with 18,000 of its top-of-the-line GB300 Grace Blackwell chips.

ìThese hyperscale AI data centers will provide a secure foundational infrastructure for training and deploying sovereign AI models at scale,î Nvidia said in a statement.

Like Nvidiaís Huang, AMDís chief Lisa Su was also in Riyadh. Her company unveiled a $10 billion deal with Humain to build AI infrastructure, while San Diego-based Qualcomm said it had separately signed an agreement with the AI startup to deliver advanced AI data centers.

Keith Strier, senior vice president of global AI markets at AMD, told Reuters that Humain didnít want to be locked into using a single vendor for AI-related hardware.

After Saudi Arabia, Trump is due to fly to neighboring Qatar and lastly to the United Arab Emirates, which has tech ambitions of its own. In 2017, it appointed the worldís first minister dedicated to AI.

In April 2024, Microsoft announced a $1.5 billion investment in G42, an AI group based in Abu Dhabi, capital of UAE, and chaired by an influential member of the ruling royal family. The New York Times reported on Monday that the Trump administration was considering a deal that could see the sale of hundreds of thousands of US AI chips to G42.

Last year, a US congressional committee called on the Commerce Department to investigate G42ís alleged links to Chinese military companies and intelligence services (G42 denied any such connections). The Microsoft investment required G42 to cut ties with Chinese hardware suppliers, reportedly including Huawei, in favor of US companies.

You can now book a chef or personal trainer while traveling with Airbnb,"
Nearly a decade ago, Airbnb envisioned being more than just an app to book a home for a vacation. Its latest redesign could be a major push toward becoming the kind of ìend-to-end travel app,î that CEO Brian Chesky has said he wants to create.

The online vacation home-rental marketplace has made efforts toward this goal in the past. It launched ìAirbnb Experiences,î tours, classes and other activities that can be booked on its app; a travel magazine; hotel-like offerings; and ìadventureî tour packages that included lodging, transportation and food.

Then the Covid-19 pandemic hit ó months before the company went public ó and Airbnb was forced to scale back some of those ambitions to focus on its core offerings.

Now, Airbnb is returning to that vision of a full-service travel platform with new features, offerings and a redesign of its app. That includes a new ìAirbnb Servicesî section where users can book chefs, masseuses, personal trainers and other types of service professionals to come to their Airbnb.

The new offerings could make Airbnb more competitive with travel platforms such as Expedia and Kayak, as well as with hotels, which can draw customers away from home stays with amenities such as restaurants and spas.

ìOne of the reasons why people donít always want to stay with Airbnb (is) because we didnít necessarily have all these other activities that you could do around the stay that maybe some more traditional hospitality has,î Airbnb Chief Business Officer Dave Stephenson told CNN in an interview ahead of the announcement on Tuesday.

ìWeíve been talking about expanding beyond the core for a long time. We now finally get to show it,î he said.

The announcement comes at an uncertain time for the travel industry, with concerns about the economy threatening to cause a slowdown in consumer spending on things like trips and experiences.

Earlier this month, despite a strong first quarter earnings report, Airbnb warned investors that growth in bookings could slow in the current quarter and that its average daily rate (how much it earns per one-night booking) would be flat year-on-year. The company has also faced lawsuits over privacy issues and increasing restrictions from local government in recent years. Airbnb shares (ABNB) have fallen more than 10% from a year ago, but are up 2% since the start of the year.

Giving users more to do on vacation
Starting on Tuesday, users can book service professionals directly from the Airbnb app through the new Services tab. There are 10 categories of services, including prepared meals, hair and make-up artists, and photographers, who will come to usersí Airbnb rentals.

For example, users can book a photographer for a ìstreet styleî photoshoot in Paris, or a personal chef for a barbecue meal in Austin, Texas. The company says service providers must apply and provide proof of experience and professional licenses before they can be listed on the app.

Service professionals can also go to usersí homes or other locations if theyíre not staying at an Airbnb rental ó a way to keep people using the site even when theyíre not traveling. The feature will be available in 100 cities around the world to start.

The company is also revamping its Experiences section by adding new, exclusive offerings called ìAirbnb Originals.î

Stephenson said Airbnb has teams around the world to work with locals to create experiences, such as a tour of the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris with an architect who worked on its restoration, or a pastry-making class at The French Bastards bakery.

ìThey are in cities, literally on the ground, reaching out to the most creative, most amazing people. We can do things like search social media and then thereís also just word of mouth,î Stephenson said of the companyís acquisition teams, adding that experiences will now be available in 1,000 cities around the world.

Unlike some existing Airbnb Experiences, the new ìoriginalsî offerings wonít be bookable on other platforms like Tripadvisor or Viator. Users can also see the other people who have booked an experience and stay in touch and share photos on a message thread with the group afterward through the app (with privacy opt-outs available).

In keeping with the goal of creating a full-service travel app, Airbnbís ìTripsî tab will now look a bit more like a full-service travel planner.

Once users book a place to stay, theyíll automatically get recommendations for experiences and services in the area, and anything they book will show up in a timeline along with their stay details, check-in and check-out instructions, and other trip information.

ìOn the experiences front, this should be able to replace somebody going out to dinner for the weekend. They might now take a dining experience,î Stephenson said. ìOr instead of going out to for a drink with friends, they could actually go on an experience to go wine tasting.î

And as for the current economic uncertainty, Stephenson said slowdowns can mean more hosts listing properties or experiences on the platform to earn extra income. The platform can also offer more cost-effective options for consumers in times of financial insecurity, he added.

ìWe also find that more people are more discerning about where they stay Ö It actually can be a help to our business,î he said.",13-May-25,Business,Clare Duffy,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/13/tech/airbnb-new-features-app-redesign,,,,,,,,,,,,nearly decade ago airbnb envisioned just app book home vacation latest redesign major push toward becoming kind ‚Äúendtoend travel app‚Äù ceo brian chesky said wants create online vacation homerental marketplace made efforts toward goal past launched ‚Äúairbnb experiences‚Äù tours classes activities can booked app travel magazine hotellike offerings ‚Äúadventure‚Äù tour packages included lodging transportation food covid pandemic hit ‚Äî months company went public ‚Äî airbnb forced scale back ambitions focus core offerings now airbnb returning vision fullservice travel platform new features offerings redesign app includes new ‚Äúairbnb services‚Äù section users can book chefs masseuses personal trainers types service professionals come airbnb new offerings make airbnb competitive travel platforms expedia kayak well hotels can draw customers away home stays amenities restaurants spas ‚Äúone reasons people don‚Äôt always want stay airbnb didn‚Äôt necessarily activities around stay maybe traditional hospitality has‚Äù airbnb chief business officer dave stephenson told cnn interview ahead announcement tuesday ‚Äúwe‚Äôve talking expanding beyond core long time now finally get show it‚Äù said announcement comes uncertain time travel industry concerns economy threatening cause slowdown consumer spending things like trips experiences earlier month despite strong first quarter earnings report airbnb warned investors growth bookings slow current quarter average daily rate much earns per onenight booking flat yearonyear company also faced lawsuits privacy issues increasing restrictions local government recent years airbnb shares abnb fallen year ago since start year giving users vacation starting tuesday users can book service professionals directly airbnb app new services tab categories services including prepared meals hair makeup artists photographers come users‚Äô airbnb rentals example users can book photographer ‚Äústreet style‚Äù photoshoot paris personal chef barbecue meal austin texas company says service providers must apply provide proof experience professional licenses can listed app service professionals can also go users‚Äô homes locations they‚Äôre staying airbnb rental ‚Äî way keep people using site even they‚Äôre traveling feature available cities around world start company also revamping experiences section adding new exclusive offerings called ‚Äúairbnb originals‚Äù stephenson said airbnb teams around world work locals create experiences tour notredame cathedral paris architect worked restoration pastrymaking class french bastards bakery ‚Äúthey cities literally ground reaching creative amazing people can things like search social media there‚Äôs also just word mouth‚Äù stephenson said company‚Äôs acquisition teams adding experiences now available cities around world unlike existing airbnb experiences new ‚Äúoriginals‚Äù offerings won‚Äôt bookable platforms like tripadvisor viator users can also see people booked experience stay touch share photos message thread group afterward app privacy optouts available keeping goal creating fullservice travel app airbnb‚Äôs ‚Äútrips‚Äù tab now look bit like fullservice travel planner users book place stay they‚Äôll automatically get recommendations experiences services area anything book show timeline along stay details checkin checkout instructions trip information ‚Äúon experiences front able replace somebody going dinner weekend might now take dining experience‚Äù stephenson said ‚Äúor instead going drink friends actually go experience go wine tasting‚Äù current economic uncertainty stephenson said slowdowns can mean hosts listing properties experiences platform earn extra income platform can also offer costeffective options consumers times financial insecurity added ‚Äúwe also find people discerning stay ‚Ä¶ actually can help business‚Äù said
Google has a solution for those unpaid toll text scams,"The next time youíre about to tap a text message to resolve an unpaid toll balance, your Android phone may warn you to think twice.

Google is updating its scam text detection technology to spot hoaxes like these, which are among the most common types of text-related schemes according to the Federal Trade Commission.

The new scam detection will come as an update to Google Messages, the messaging app installed on most Android phones by default. Google Messages already monitors texts for other types of popular ploys like fake job offers and bogus package theft alerts.

It will start rolling out on Tuesday and is just one of several Android updates Google announced ahead of its developersí conference next week ñ along with cosmetic software changes and the expansion of its Gemini AI helper to Android-powered smartwatches and cars.

Text scams related to phony unpaid tolls have been on the rise. The FBIís Internet Crime Complaint Center received roughly 60,000 complaints related to toll scams last year, and fake unpaid toll texts nearly quadrupled between January and late February according security software maker McAfee. Consumers lost $470 million to text scams in 2024, according to the FTC.

ìWeíve just been hearing from users like constantly that this is a problem,î Sameer Samat, Googleís Android ecosystem president, said in a CNN interview.

The anti-spam tech works by analyzing a conversation for red flags. Like most phishing scams, these texts may include poor grammar, urgent language, suspicious links and imitations of official logos, according to roadside assistance and insurance provider AAA.

But, according to Samat, fraudsters are adopting more sophisticated tactics. For example, scammers may hide or rotate URLs to make them harder to detect. They might also borrow language from legitimate sources to make their message sound more convincing.

ìThese texts look deceptively simple,î Samat said. ìBut actually there (is) a whole bunch in them that is complicated.î

When receiving what could be a scam text, Google Messages will show an alert labeling the message as a ìlikely scamî with the option to either report and block the number, or tell Google it isnít a scam.

These messages are typically crafted to look like theyíre coming from a legitimate toll agency and will include a phone number or link to make a payment, AAA says. New York Governor Kathy Hochul issued a warning earlier this year to users of the electronic toll collection system E-ZPass, saying customers will never be prompted to hand over personal information such as credit card data or social security numbers via text or email. The scammers usually ask for small sums of money.

Google says its detection algorithm runs on-device, meaning it doesnít need to send information about a userís text messages to its servers to pick up on those warning signs. In addition to unpaid toll scams, the update also enables Googleís messaging app to spot potentially fraudulent texts related to crypto, technical support and gift cards.

Google isnít the only tech company trying to crack down on scam texts; McAfee also offers a tool that it says can spot potentially malicious links in texts, while security software provider Bitdefender offers a free chatbot users can share suspicious texts, emails and links for analysis. But Googleís tech is integrated into the messaging app Android device owners are likely already using.

Itís one of several security-related updates from the search giant, coming after the company recently announced a tool for identifying scam websites in its Chrome browser. Google is also piloting a feature that warns users when sharing their phoneís screen with an unknown contact while using a banking app.

ìThe scammers are really upping the bar on what they are trying to do,î Samat said. ìAnd so we felt like we had to match that.î",13-May-25,Business,Lisa Eadicicco,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/13/tech/unpaid-toll-scam-text-message-detection-google-android,,,,,,,,,,,,next time you‚Äôre tap text message resolve unpaid toll balance android phone may warn think twice google updating scam text detection technology spot hoaxes like among common types textrelated schemes according federal trade commission new scam detection come update google messages messaging app installed android phones default google messages already monitors texts types popular ploys like fake job offers bogus package theft alerts start rolling tuesday just one several android updates google announced ahead developers‚Äô conference next week ‚Äì along cosmetic software changes expansion gemini ai helper androidpowered smartwatches cars text scams related phony unpaid tolls rise fbi‚Äôs internet crime complaint center received roughly complaints related toll scams last year fake unpaid toll texts nearly quadrupled january late february according security software maker mcafee consumers lost million text scams according ftc ‚Äúwe‚Äôve just hearing users like constantly problem‚Äù sameer samat google‚Äôs android ecosystem president said cnn interview antispam tech works analyzing conversation red flags like phishing scams texts may include poor grammar urgent language suspicious links imitations official logos according roadside assistance insurance provider aaa according samat fraudsters adopting sophisticated tactics example scammers may hide rotate urls make harder detect might also borrow language legitimate sources make message sound convincing ‚Äúthese texts look deceptively simple‚Äù samat said ‚Äúbut actually whole bunch complicated‚Äù receiving scam text google messages show alert labeling message ‚Äúlikely scam‚Äù option either report block number tell google isn‚Äôt scam messages typically crafted look like they‚Äôre coming legitimate toll agency include phone number link make payment aaa says new york governor kathy hochul issued warning earlier year users electronic toll collection system ezpass saying customers never prompted hand personal information credit card data social security numbers via text email scammers usually ask small sums money google says detection algorithm runs ondevice meaning doesn‚Äôt need send information user‚Äôs text messages servers pick warning signs addition unpaid toll scams update also enables google‚Äôs messaging app spot potentially fraudulent texts related crypto technical support gift cards google isn‚Äôt tech company trying crack scam texts mcafee also offers tool says can spot potentially malicious links texts security software provider bitdefender offers free chatbot users can share suspicious texts emails links analysis google‚Äôs tech integrated messaging app android device owners likely already using it‚Äôs one several securityrelated updates search giant coming company recently announced tool identifying scam websites chrome browser google also piloting feature warns users sharing phone‚Äôs screen unknown contact using banking app ‚Äúthe scammers really upping bar trying do‚Äù samat said ‚Äúand felt like match that‚Äù
"Microsoft to lay off 3% of workforce, report says","
Microsoft is laying off 3% of its workforce, or roughly 7,000 employees, CNBC reported on Tuesday, as the technology giant looks to rein in costs while funneling billions of dollars into its ambitious bet on artificial intelligence.

The cuts will be across all levels and geographies, and are likely the largest since Microsoft laid off 10,000 employees in 2023, according to the report, which cited a company statement.

The company let a small number of employees go in January over performance-related issues, but the latest cuts are not related to that and are focused on trimming management layers, the report said.

Microsoft did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The companyís stock was slightly lower in morning trading.

As artificial intelligence emerges as a major growth engine, Big Tech has been pouring money into the space while slashing costs elsewhere to safeguard profit margins.

Rival Google has also laid off hundreds of employees in the past year, as it looks to control costs and prioritize AI, media reports have said.

Microsoftís reported move comes weeks after the company posted stronger-than-expected growth in its cloud-computing business Azure and blowout results in the latest quarter, calming investor worries in an uncertain economy.

The company had a total of 228,000 workers, with 126,000 employees in the United States at the end of June last year, according to its annual filing with the US SEC.",13-May-25,Business,Camila Moreno-Lizarazo,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/13/tech/microsoft-layoffs-3-percent-of-workforce,,,,,,,,,,,,microsoft laying workforce roughly employees cnbc reported tuesday technology giant looks rein costs funneling billions dollars ambitious bet artificial intelligence cuts across levels geographies likely largest since microsoft laid employees according report cited company statement company let small number employees go january performancerelated issues latest cuts related focused trimming management layers report said microsoft immediately respond reuters request comment company‚Äôs stock slightly lower morning trading artificial intelligence emerges major growth engine big tech pouring money space slashing costs elsewhere safeguard profit margins rival google also laid hundreds employees past year looks control costs prioritize ai media reports said microsoft‚Äôs reported move comes weeks company posted strongerthanexpected growth cloudcomputing business azure blowout results latest quarter calming investor worries uncertain economy company total workers employees united states end june last year according annual filing us sec
ESPN finally reveals the name of its new flagship streaming service,"After much teasing and speculation, ESPN has finally unveiled the details of its new flagship streaming service.

While the streamer long had the working title ìFlagship,î the Disney-owned sports network revealed the platform, slated to launch in the fall, will be called something even simpler: ESPN.

ìAs we explored options, we kept coming back to our four letters ESPN,î network chairman James Pitaro explained during a press event on Tuesday morning. ìThereís power in our name, and thereís trust in our name.î

The direct-to-consumer platform will feature two subscription tiers at launch, said Roz Durant, ESPNís executive vice president of programming and acquisitions.

The unlimited plan will cost $29.99 per month (or $45.99 when bundled with Disney+ and Hulu) and will give users access to all things ESPN ó including ESPNs 2 and 3, along with ESPNU, ESPN Deportes and a slate of college sports-focused networks. ìThatís 47,000 live events, studio shows and more every year,î Durant said.

The other plan, titled ìselect,î will cost $11.99 per month and will include all content currently available on the ESPN+ over-the-top service.

Since the platform was first announced, Disney executives have touted the streamer as an immersive new experience for sports fans. During a sit-down with CNBC last year, Disney chief executive Bob Iger hailed the streaming service as ìvery user-friendly because itís more app-based.î

The streamer reveal comes as Disney looks to shore up its subscriber numbers, as its linear networks have been challenged by the same cord-cutting habits as the rest of the industry.

However, live sporting events have proved relatively impervious to the viewership declines felt across traditional television. Thatís why Disney was willing to spend big to ensure ESPN would retain its NBA rights, especially among an overcrowded streaming sector, with heavyweights like Netflix, Amazonís Prime Video and WBDís Max carving up access to sporting events.

During its quarterly report last week, Disney posted strong earnings despite the economic headwinds from President Donald Trumpís tariff chaos. Revenue at ESPN was up 5% to $4.53 billion, even as operating income dropped 16%.

Disney attributed that drop to increased programming and production costs from three additional college football playoff games and an added NFL game during the quarter, though these helped increase domestic advertising revenue 29%.

To ensure a smooth launch, Iger said on the earnings call that linear ESPN subscribers will automatically get the ESPN flagship streamer.

ESPNís streamer reveal comes just over four months after the collapse of Venu Sports, the joint sports streaming venture among Warner Bros. Discovery, Disney, and Fox. In Venuís final months, Disney began touting its own streaming platform, hedging its bets as it became increasingly clear there was no path for Venu to launch. (WBD is CNNís parent company.)

The trioís decision not to launch the JV came after they ended a months-long lawsuit from Fubo four days earlier. Despite that, reports had emerged that satellite TV providers DirecTV and Dish had asked a judge to reconsider dismissing Fuboís case, signaling further delays in the platformís launch.",13-May-25,Business,Liam Reilly,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/13/media/espn-reveals-name-flagship-sports-streaming-service,,,,,,,,,,,,much teasing speculation espn finally unveiled details new flagship streaming service streamer long working title ‚Äúflagship‚Äù disneyowned sports network revealed platform slated launch fall called something even simpler espn ‚Äúas explored options kept coming back four letters espn‚Äù network chairman james pitaro explained press event tuesday morning ‚Äúthere‚Äôs power name there‚Äôs trust name‚Äù directtoconsumer platform feature two subscription tiers launch said roz durant espn‚Äôs executive vice president programming acquisitions unlimited plan cost per month bundled disney hulu give users access things espn ‚Äî including espns along espnu espn deportes slate college sportsfocused networks ‚Äúthat‚Äôs live events studio shows every year‚Äù durant said plan titled ‚Äúselect‚Äù cost per month include content currently available espn overthetop service since platform first announced disney executives touted streamer immersive new experience sports fans sitdown cnbc last year disney chief executive bob iger hailed streaming service ‚Äúvery userfriendly it‚Äôs appbased‚Äù streamer reveal comes disney looks shore subscriber numbers linear networks challenged cordcutting habits rest industry however live sporting events proved relatively impervious viewership declines felt across traditional television that‚Äôs disney willing spend big ensure espn retain nba rights especially among overcrowded streaming sector heavyweights like netflix amazon‚Äôs prime video wbd‚Äôs max carving access sporting events quarterly report last week disney posted strong earnings despite economic headwinds president donald trump‚Äôs tariff chaos revenue espn billion even operating income dropped disney attributed drop increased programming production costs three additional college football playoff games added nfl game quarter though helped increase domestic advertising revenue ensure smooth launch iger said earnings call linear espn subscribers automatically get espn flagship streamer espn‚Äôs streamer reveal comes just four months collapse venu sports joint sports streaming venture among warner bros discovery disney fox venu‚Äôs final months disney began touting streaming platform hedging bets became increasingly clear path venu launch wbd cnn‚Äôs parent company trio‚Äôs decision launch jv came ended monthslong lawsuit fubo four days earlier despite reports emerged satellite tv providers directv dish asked judge reconsider dismissing fubo‚Äôs case signaling delays platform‚Äôs launch
Its a bribe: MAGA media stars bash Trumps reported Qatar plane gift,"ìIndefensible.î ìItís a bribe.î ìSuch a stainî on the administration.

Some of President Donald Trumpís staunchest supporters are among the loudest critics of his plan to accept a jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One.

In a rare break from the cheerleading that typifies MAGA media outlets, some commentators are using their platforms to urge Trump to change his mind about the highly unusual gift. Others are encouraging Trump voters to consider how theyíd react if a Democratic president hatched the same plan.

ìI think if we switched the names to Hunter Biden and Joe Biden, weíd all be freaking out on the right,î Daily Wire co-founder Ben Shapiro said Monday on his podcast.

Shapiro also linked the potential Qatari deal with other reports of ìinfluence peddling,î like Trumpís cryptocurrency sweepstakes.

ìThe administrationís policy is too important for this sort of activity,î Shapiro said, emphasizing that he wants Trump to succeed. ìPresident Trump promised to drain the swamp. This is not, in fact, draining the swamp.î

Some Trump-aligned commentators and social media stars are echoing the presidentís talking points about the luxury jet, including his insistence that only ìstupid peopleî would turn down such a gift. Some MAGA media outlets are deflecting the criticism by sowing doubt about the media coverage of the controversy.

However, a striking number of Trump boosters sound almost as outraged as the Democratic lawmakers who say accepting the plane would be profoundly unethical and possibly illegal.

Many of these right-wing critics, like Laura Loomer, predicated their objections on Qatarís relationship with the militant group Hamas.

Senior members of Hamas have long been based in the Qatari capital of Doha, though Qatar reportedly agreed to expel Hamas officials last November.

Loomer criticized Trumpís potential jet deal on Sunday and Monday by writing a series of anti-Qatar posts on X. ìThis is really going to be such a stain on the admin if this is true,î she wrote. ìAnd I say that as someone who would take a bullet for Trump. Iím so disappointed.î

Fox News host Mark Levin shared her post and wrote, ìDitto.î

For now, most of the conservative criticism has been leveled in social media spaces, not on the TV shows Trump is known to enjoy. The jet controversy has been very lightly covered on Fox News, the countryís dominant right-wing TV channel. The main story on Foxís website about the matter on Monday was titled, ìTrump rips ABC reporter for asking about accepting luxury jet from Qatar,î as if ABC was the problem.

But ìFox & Friendsî host Brian Kilmeade did ask White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt about the matter on Monday morning.

Leavitt positioned it as a government-to-government transaction that would be done ìin full compliance with the law,î sidestepping reports that Trumpís presidential library will take possession of the plane shortly before he leaves office, ensuring he can still use it.

The ìFox & Friendsî host then asked Leavitt, ìDo you worry that if they give us something like this, they want something in return?î The press secretary said no because Trump ìonly works with the interest of the American public in mind.î

Kilmeade then moved on and asked Leavitt about Motherís Day.

Other conservative media figures seem less inclined to move on.

ìThis is not a giftî from Qatar, itís ìa bribe,î Batya Ungar-Sargon, who has championed the MAGA movement on CNN and other channels, told Newsmax on Monday afternoon.

National Review contributing editor Andrew McCarthy wrote Monday that accepting the plane is ìindefensible,î arguing that ìthe president and his flacks again demonstrate that they donít grasp the concepts of constitutional duty and conflicts of interest.î He cited the ìTrump family crypto ventureî as another example.

Talk radio host Erick Erickson, who, like the National Review, has often criticized Trump from a conservative perspective, didnít mince his condemnation of the potential jet gift.

On his Monday show, Erickson argued that Qatar is not a US ally (though the US government disagrees) and pointed out that Attorney General Pam Bondi, who reportedly signed off on the legality of the gift, was previously a paid lobbyist for Qatar.

ìI think sheís opening Donald Trump up to legal trouble later,î Erickson said.

On X later in the day, Erickson observed that ìeven a lot of Trump supporters were not thrilled about the Qatar plane giftî when the initial reports surfaced on Sunday.

ìNow,î he wrote, suggesting bots are flooding X with pro-Trump propaganda, ìa lot of small accounts Iíve never interacted with before are flooding my timeline insisting it is a great idea.î",12-May-25,Business,Brian Stelter,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/12/media/maga-media-shapiro-loomer-levin-trump-qatar-plane-gift,,,,,,,,,,,,‚Äúindefensible‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs bribe‚Äù ‚Äúsuch stain‚Äù administration president donald trump‚Äôs staunchest supporters among loudest critics plan accept jet qatar use air force one rare break cheerleading typifies maga media outlets commentators using platforms urge trump change mind highly unusual gift others encouraging trump voters consider they‚Äôd react democratic president hatched plan ‚Äúi think switched names hunter biden joe biden we‚Äôd freaking right‚Äù daily wire cofounder ben shapiro said monday podcast shapiro also linked potential qatari deal reports ‚Äúinfluence peddling‚Äù like trump‚Äôs cryptocurrency sweepstakes ‚Äúthe administration‚Äôs policy important sort activity‚Äù shapiro said emphasizing wants trump succeed ‚Äúpresident trump promised drain swamp fact draining swamp‚Äù trumpaligned commentators social media stars echoing president‚Äôs talking points luxury jet including insistence ‚Äústupid people‚Äù turn gift maga media outlets deflecting criticism sowing doubt media coverage controversy however striking number trump boosters sound almost outraged democratic lawmakers say accepting plane profoundly unethical possibly illegal many rightwing critics like laura loomer predicated objections qatar‚Äôs relationship militant group hamas senior members hamas long based qatari capital doha though qatar reportedly agreed expel hamas officials last november loomer criticized trump‚Äôs potential jet deal sunday monday writing series antiqatar posts x ‚Äúthis really going stain admin true‚Äù wrote ‚Äúand say someone take bullet trump i‚Äôm disappointed‚Äù fox news host mark levin shared post wrote ‚Äúditto‚Äù now conservative criticism leveled social media spaces tv shows trump known enjoy jet controversy lightly covered fox news country‚Äôs dominant rightwing tv channel main story fox‚Äôs website matter monday titled ‚Äútrump rips abc reporter asking accepting luxury jet qatar‚Äù abc problem ‚Äúfox friends‚Äù host brian kilmeade ask white house press secretary karoline leavitt matter monday morning leavitt positioned governmenttogovernment transaction done ‚Äúin full compliance law‚Äù sidestepping reports trump‚Äôs presidential library take possession plane shortly leaves office ensuring can still use ‚Äúfox friends‚Äù host asked leavitt ‚Äúdo worry give us something like want something return‚Äù press secretary said trump ‚Äúonly works interest american public mind‚Äù kilmeade moved asked leavitt mother‚Äôs day conservative media figures seem less inclined move ‚Äúthis gift‚Äù qatar it‚Äôs ‚Äúa bribe‚Äù batya ungarsargon championed maga movement cnn channels told newsmax monday afternoon national review contributing editor andrew mccarthy wrote monday accepting plane ‚Äúindefensible‚Äù arguing ‚Äúthe president flacks demonstrate don‚Äôt grasp concepts constitutional duty conflicts interest‚Äù cited ‚Äútrump family crypto venture‚Äù another example talk radio host erick erickson like national review often criticized trump conservative perspective didn‚Äôt mince condemnation potential jet gift monday show erickson argued qatar us ally though us government disagrees pointed attorney general pam bondi reportedly signed legality gift previously paid lobbyist qatar ‚Äúi think she‚Äôs opening donald trump legal trouble later‚Äù erickson said x later day erickson observed ‚Äúeven lot trump supporters thrilled qatar plane gift‚Äù initial reports surfaced sunday ‚Äúnow‚Äù wrote suggesting bots flooding x protrump propaganda ‚Äúa lot small accounts i‚Äôve never interacted flooding timeline insisting great idea‚Äù
New documentary claims to identify Israeli soldier who shot Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh in 2022,"A new documentary about the 2022 killing of Al Jazeera correspondent Shireen Abu Akleh claims to have identified the Israeli soldier who fired the fatal shot.

Additionally, the film alleges that while the Biden administration had initially concluded an Israeli soldier intentionally shot at Abu Akleh, despite the fact she was identifiable as media, it publicly declared that there was ìno reason to believeî her killing was ìintentional.î

The documentary, produced by independent news outlet Zeteo and titled ìWho Killed Shireen?,î follows former Wall Street Journal Middle East reporter Dion Nissenbaum and longtime foreign correspondent Conor Powell as they and fellow journalists seek to figure out who killed Abu Akleh and how the Biden administration handled the investigation into her killing.

Abu Akleh, a Palestinian journalist with US citizenship, was a well-known and respected correspondent for Al Jazeera. She was shot while covering an Israeli military operation targeting militants in Jenin in May 2022. When she was killed, she was wearing protective gear identifying her as a member of the press.

In the immediate aftermath of her death, Israeli officials suggested crossfire from Palestinian militants fighting with Israeli soldiers nearby could have been to blame. Shortly thereafter, however, investigations by CNN?and other outlets found that the only militants in the area could not have reached Abu Akleh from where they stood when she was killed.? CNN further concluded that she was killed in a targeted attack, based on eyewitness statements and analysis from audio forensic and explosive weapons experts.

The Israel Defense Forces?eventually said?there was a ìhigh possibilityî Abu Akleh was killed by Israeli fire, but said they would not charge any soldiers as there ìwas no suspicion that a bullet was fired deliberatelyî at anyone identified as a journalist and the soldier thought he was shooting at militants who were firing upon him. An Israeli military spokesperson later apologized for the journalistís death and said the soldier responsible ìdid not do this on purpose.î

But one subject interviewed for the documentary, identified only as a ìkey Biden administration official,î says that based on where the soldiers and the reporters were located at the time, ìit was an indication that it was an intentional killingî and that the soldier would have been able to clearly see Abu Akleh was a noncombatant.

ìWhether or not they knew it was her or not, can very well be debated, but they would have absolutely known that it was a media person or a noncombatant at a minimum,î the anonymous Biden administration official states. ìAbsolutely knew that it was non-combatant, and every indication was that it was media. It was clear within all optics from that distance and location and the visual capabilities of that day.î

The documentary does not detail how the official knows this information, although a source close to the documentary told CNN the official had ìdirect knowledgeî of the Biden administrationís internal assessments of Abu Aklehís death.

As for who fired the fatal shots, an unidentified Israeli soldier interviewed in the documentary, who said he served alongside the soldier responsible for the slaying, identified the soldier by name and said he was a member of an elite commando unit called Duvdevan. (Because CNN has not been able to verify the reporting, we are not naming the soldier.)

ìWhen you open the corner and you have this second to take a decision, to take a shot and you see someone who hold a camera or something that, you know, point at you, you donít need more than that to shoot the bullet,î the anonymous soldier says in the documentary.

The soldier identified as Abu Aklehís killer ìwasnít happyî to discover he killed a journalist, the fellow soldier says, but ìhe wasnít like, you know, eating himself from the inside, like thinking about, ëOh, what have I done,í or something like that.î

Abu Aklehís alleged shooter was later killed by an explosive device buried in the road during a June 2024 military operation in Jenin, the documentary notes. His family has said in interviews with Israeli media that he died while rescuing military medics, whoíd been injured by a separate explosion allegedly planted by Palestinian militants.

Reached for comment, the IDF said ìZeteo has decided to publish the name of the IDF soldier who fell during an operational activity, despite the familyís request not to publish the name, and even though they were told that there is no definitive determination regarding the identity of the individual responsible for the shooting that caused the journalistís death. The IDF shares in the familyís grief and continues to support them.î

A State Department investigation into Abu Aklehís death, released in July 2022, found that the IDF was ìlikely responsibleî for the shooting, but that there was ìno reason to believeî the soldier intentionally targeted her.

However, the unidentified Biden administration official alleges in the documentary that despite those findings, the administrationís assessment was ultimately publicly presented as the shooting having been ìa tragic accident versus being an intentional killing of the individual.î He alleges the alteration was made because of ìpressure within the administration to not try and anger the government of Israel too much by trying to force their hand at saying that theyíd intentionally killed a US citizen.î

The State Department did not respond to a request for comment. The Department of Justice, which was reportedly working on its own investigation, declined to comment.

Since Abu Aklehís death, the situation on the ground in the region for reporters has changed dramatically. In May 2024, Al Jazeera was officially banned from Israel and the West Bank, with its offices in Ramallah at one point sealed shut by the IDF.

In Gaza, press watchdog groups say at least 175 reporters, photographers, producers and other journalists have been killed since Israel began its military campaign following Hamasís October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel.

In some cases, Israel has claimed that the journalists killed were working with militant groups. Nevertheless, the war in Gaza has become the deadliest conflict on record for members of the media.

In the documentary, Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who has long advocated for more accountability following Abu Aklehís death, said he believes ìif the US had been more effective and more forceful in insisting that the rules of engagement changed after the killing of Shireen Abu Akleh,î then further civilian deaths could have been avoided.

Abu Aklehís family echoed that sentiment in a statement to CNN: ìOur calls for justice have never been about one individual soldier, but rather for the entire chain of commandóthose who gave the orders, those who covered it up, and those who continue to deny responsibility ó be held to account for the killing of Shireen Abu Akleh on May 11, 2022 . Only then can there be any hope for real closure, not just for Shireen, but for every journalist and family seeking truth.

ìRegardless if the soldierís identity is known or whether he is dead or alive doesnít change the fact that Shireen was intentionally targeted and killed, and that happened within a system that enables impunity.î",8-May-25,Business,Hadas Gold,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/08/media/documentary-israeli-soldier-al-jazeera-journalist-shireen-abu-akleh,,,,,,,,,,,,new documentary killing al jazeera

Trump rails against the Emmys over 60 Minutes nomination,"President Donald Trump is belatedly raging against CBS Newsí latest Emmy nomination.

The president took to his Truth Social platform on Wednesday morning to vent about the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciencesí decision to nominate the ì60 Minutesî interview at the center of his defamation lawsuit against CBS for an Emmy Award last week.

ìIn a total slap in the face to anyone who believes in TRUTH and Honest Journalism, this Fake News Puff Piece has now been nominated for an award by the totally discredited Emmys,î Trump fumed about the Outstanding Edited Interview nod being given to the newsmagazineís October 2024 sit-down with then-Vice President Kamala Harris.

ìThese antics are why the American People have no trust in the Press, and demand that the Media, very much including 60 Minutes, CBS, and its owners, be held responsible for their corruption and lies, which is exactly what we are doing in Court,î he continued.

In a November lawsuit, Trump accused ì60 Minutesî of deliberately mis-editing that Harris interview at the Democratic campaignís direction, an accusation he has repeatedly leveled, including on Wednesday, when he described the interview as ìmuch worse than expected,î ìunlawfully fixed,î ìmanipulated,î and ìdoctored throughout.î He once again claimed that ì60 Minutesî is an ìElection Interferingî program.

CBS in October called the suit baseless and said, ìWe will vigorously defend against it.î Numerous First Amendment lawyers agreed that the lawsuit, which alleged that CBS engaged in consumer fraud, was frivolous. However, after Trump won the 2024 election, CBSí parent company, Paramount, which will need Trumpís approval for its pending merger with Skydance, began to discuss settling the case.

Trump and his allies have made it a mission to punish ì60 Minutesî and CBS News for the interview. Two days after the inauguration, Trumpís new Federal Communications Commission chair, Brendan Carr, revived a complaint about the broadcast that his predecessor had dismissed. That inquiry has resulted in the broadcaster releasing the interviewís full transcript despite initially resisting such a move. On Monday, Carr called his probe a ìpenalty,î not a ìthreat.î


Despite Trumpís attempts to discredit ì60 Minutesî and the Emmys, the academy last week told CNN that the Harris interview was ìevaluated by two separate panels of judges, including senior editorial leaders from every other major U.S. broadcast news organization.î The interview was selected from more than three dozen submissions and was ìnominated on the strength of its journalism.î

Meanwhile, Paramount heiress Shari Redstoneís desire to settle the lawsuit to help facilitate a merger has led to discontent within CBS. In late April, Bill Owens, the longtime ì60 Minutesî executive producer, announced he would step down because he could no longer make ìindependent decisions based on what was right for 60 Minutes.î

Scott Pelley, the programís anchor, noted in its first broadcast after Owensí announcement that Paramount had begun to ìsupervise our content in new waysî as it looked to finesse the Skydance merger.

Despite reports that Redstone had urged ì60 Minutesî producers to hold off on segments critical of the president, the newsmagazine has so far refused to comply.",7-May-25,Business,Liam Reilly,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/07/media/trump-emmys-60-minutes-kamala-harris-interview-nomination,,,,,,,,,,,,president donald trump belatedly raging cbs news‚Äô latest emmy nomination president took truth social platform wednesday morning vent national academy television arts sciences‚Äô decision nominate ‚Äú minutes‚Äù interview center defamation lawsuit cbs emmy award last week ‚Äúin total slap face anyone believes truth honest journalism fake news puff piece now nominated award totally discredited emmys‚Äù trump fumed outstanding edited interview nod given newsmagazine‚Äôs october sitdown thenvice president kamala harris ‚Äúthese antics american people trust press demand media much including minutes cbs owners held responsible corruption lies exactly court‚Äù continued november lawsuit trump accused ‚Äú minutes‚Äù deliberately misediting harris interview democratic campaign‚Äôs direction accusation repeatedly leveled including wednesday described interview ‚Äúmuch worse expected‚Äù ‚Äúunlawfully fixed‚Äù ‚Äúmanipulated‚Äù ‚Äúdoctored throughout‚Äù claimed ‚Äú minutes‚Äù ‚Äúelection interfering‚Äù program cbs october called suit baseless said ‚Äúwe vigorously defend it‚Äù numerous first amendment lawyers agreed lawsuit alleged cbs engaged consumer fraud frivolous however trump won election cbs‚Äô parent company paramount need trump‚Äôs approval pending merger skydance began discuss settling case trump allies made mission punish ‚Äú minutes‚Äù cbs news interview two days inauguration trump‚Äôs new federal communications commission chair brendan carr revived complaint broadcast predecessor dismissed inquiry resulted broadcaster releasing interview‚Äôs full transcript despite initially resisting move monday carr called probe ‚Äúpenalty‚Äù ‚Äúthreat‚Äù despite trump‚Äôs attempts discredit ‚Äú minutes‚Äù emmys academy last week told cnn harris interview ‚Äúevaluated two separate panels judges including senior editorial leaders every major us broadcast news organization‚Äù interview selected three dozen submissions ‚Äúnominated strength journalism‚Äù meanwhile paramount heiress shari redstone‚Äôs desire settle lawsuit help facilitate merger led discontent within cbs late april bill owens longtime ‚Äú minutes‚Äù executive producer announced step longer make ‚Äúindependent decisions based right minutes‚Äù scott pelley program‚Äôs anchor noted first broadcast owens‚Äô announcement paramount begun ‚Äúsupervise content new ways‚Äù looked finesse skydance merger despite reports redstone urged ‚Äú minutes‚Äù producers hold segments critical president newsmagazine far refused comply
Streaming and texting on the Moon: Nokia and NASA are taking 4G into space,"Texting on the Moon? Streaming on Mars? It may not be as far away as you think.

Thatís the shared vision of NASA and Nokia, who have partnered to set up a cellular network on the Moon to help lay the building blocks for long-term human presence on other planets.

A SpaceX rocket is due to launch this year ó the exact date has yet to be confirmed ó carrying a simple 4G network to the Moon. The lander will install the system at the Moonís south pole and then it will be remotely controlled from Earth.

ìThe first challenge to getting a network up and running is having a space-qualified cellular equipment that meets the appropriate size, weight, and power requirements, as well as being deployed without a technician,î Walt Engelund, deputy associate administrator for programs at NASAís Space Technology Mission Directorate, told CNN. No less of a challenge, it will need to operate in the harsh lunar environment of extreme temperatures and radiation.

The 4G network unit is being built by Nokiaís Bell Labs using a range of off-the-shelf commercial components. It will be loaded onto a lander made by US company Intuitive Machines, and once deployed it will connect the lander via radio equipment to two roaming vehicles with their own special mission: to search for ice.

One of the vehicles, the Lunar Outpost rover, will explore the area known as Shackleton Connecting Ridge, while the other, the Micro-Nova hopper, will plunge into a crater to scan for unprecedented up-close evidence of Moon ice.

Images of ice ó transmitted back to the lander and then Earth in near real-time via the cellular network ó would be a world-first. Lunar ice could be used to create breathable oxygen, and even fuel that could eventually be used to launch Mars missions from the Moon.

For NASAís Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon this decade, cellular connectivity is invaluable.

Currently, astronauts talk to each other by radio, but NASA wants a lunar communications system capable of supporting high-resolution video and science data, said Engelund ó especially as Artemis missions become more sophisticated.

ìBeing able to communicate on the Moon is critical to Artemis ó as critical as any other mission element like power, water to drink, and air to breathe,î said Engelund.

ìEventually, this effort will help establish a lunar communications network that could give our explorers the ability to beam scientific data back, confer with mission control, and talk to their families, as if they were walking down the street on their cellphones.î

It could lay the groundwork for an off-world internet not dissimilar to that of Earthís. Personal devices could connect to such networks, allowing ?space colonists to use smartphones that can access all the apps and services available to those back on Earth.

NASA selected Bell Labs as part of its Tipping Point initiative, a series of partnerships with companies to develop technologies for future missions that puts them in prime position for key roles in the future space economy.

Bell Labs was given a $14.1 million grant in 2020, and in January, Nokia was selected by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to begin working on a communications services infrastructure that will eventually serve as the ìframework for the lunar economy.î

ìA future lunar economy will critically depend on communication technologies to collect and analyze data, share information, and maintain and control operations,î Thierry Klein, president of Bell Labs Solutions Research, told CNN.

ìThis includes sustaining a semi-permanent or permanent human presence on the Moon, as well as automated robotic operations for transportation, resource mining, mineral processing and scientific data collection.î",24-Apr-25,Business,Jack Bantock,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/24/tech/nokia-moon-4g-network-nasa-spc,,,,,,,,,,,,texting moon streaming mars may far away think that‚Äôs shared vision nasa nokia partnered set cellular network moon help lay building blocks longterm human presence planets spacex rocket due launch year ‚Äî exact date yet confirmed ‚Äî carrying simple g network moon lander install system moon‚Äôs south pole remotely controlled earth ‚Äúthe first challenge getting network running spacequalified cellular equipment meets appropriate size weight power requirements well deployed without technician‚Äù walt engelund deputy associate administrator programs nasa‚Äôs space technology mission directorate told cnn less challenge need operate harsh lunar environment extreme temperatures radiation g network unit built nokia‚Äôs bell labs using range offtheshelf commercial components loaded onto lander made us company intuitive machines deployed connect lander via radio equipment two roaming vehicles special mission search ice one vehicles lunar outpost rover explore area known shackleton connecting ridge micronova hopper plunge crater scan unprecedented upclose evidence moon ice images ice ‚Äî transmitted back lander earth near realtime via cellular network ‚Äî worldfirst lunar ice used create breathable oxygen even fuel eventually used launch mars missions moon nasa‚Äôs artemis program aims return astronauts moon decade cellular connectivity invaluable currently astronauts talk radio nasa wants lunar communications system capable supporting highresolution video science data said engelund ‚Äî especially artemis missions become sophisticated ‚Äúbeing able communicate moon critical artemis ‚Äî critical mission element like power water drink air breathe‚Äù said engelund ‚Äúeventually effort help establish lunar communications network give explorers ability beam scientific data back confer mission control talk families walking street cellphones‚Äù lay groundwork offworld internet dissimilar earth‚Äôs personal devices connect networks allowing space colonists use smartphones can access apps services available back earth nasa selected bell labs part tipping point initiative series partnerships companies develop technologies future missions puts prime position key roles future space economy bell labs given million grant january nokia selected us defense advanced research projects agency darpa begin working communications services infrastructure eventually serve ‚Äúframework lunar economy‚Äù ‚Äúa future lunar economy critically depend communication technologies collect analyze data share information maintain control operations‚Äù thierry klein president bell labs solutions research told cnn ‚Äúthis includes sustaining semipermanent permanent human presence moon well automated robotic operations transportation resource mining mineral processing scientific data collection‚Äù
"The electric car revolution is on track, says IEA","Global electric vehicle sales are set to rise by more than a fifth to reach 17 million this year, powered by drivers in China, according to the International Energy Agency.

In a report Tuesday, the IEA projected that ìsurging demandî for EVs over the next decade was set ìto remake the global auto industry and significantly reduce oil consumption for road transport.î

It expects half of all cars sold globally to be electric by 2035, up from more than one in five this year, provided charging infrastructure keeps pace. The IEA includes battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles in its definition of EVs.

The agencyís bullish long-term outlook for EVs ó based on current government policies ó comes just days after the worldís biggest battery EV maker Tesla slashed its prices in major markets to counter declining sales and growing competition from Chinese upstarts and established carmakers.

Recent negative headlines about slowing EV penetration are out of step with positive global trends, according to IEA executive director Fatih Birol. The data ìdoes not at all show a reverse of the growth of electric cars. It shows an extremely robust increase of global electric car sales,î he told reporters Tuesday.

The growth is not driven just by Chinese buyers. The number of new battery electric cars sold in the European Union rose almost 4% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2023, according to the European Automobile Manufacturersí Association.

In a statement, Birol said: ìRather than tapering off, the global EV revolution appears to be gearing up for a new phase of growth.î

Despite the upbeat trends, EV makers are grappling with slim profit margins, squeezed by price wars as competition heats.

In the past few days, Tesla and Chinese EV maker Li Auto have cut prices on major models in China, the worldís biggest EV market, with Tesla also cutting prices in Germany and the United States.

Earlier this month, Tesla posted its first annual drop in sales in nearly four years. The companyís stock has plunged more than 40% so far this year. Chinaís BYD has also stumbled after it briefly surpassed Tesla as global market leader, with its sales falling to about 300,000 in the first quarter from more than 525,000 in the final three months of 2023.

Automakers may be hurting from the price cuts but they will be crucial to increasing the take-up of EVs around the world, according to the IEA, which emphasized that the ìpace of the transition to EVsÖ will hinge on affordability.î

In China, more than 60% of EVs sold last year were less expensive than conventional cars, but in Europe and the United States the purchase price for new cars with internal combustion engines remains lower on average.

ìIntensifying market competition and improving battery technologies are expected to reduce (EV) prices in the coming years,î the IEA said.

ìGrowing electric car exports from Chinese automakers, which accounted for more than half of all electric car sales in 2023, could add to downward pressure on purchase prices,î it added.

Last year, Chinese carmakers accounted for more than half of global electric car sales, compared with their 10% share of the conventional car market. ìChina is the de facto leader of electric car manufacturing around the world,î Birol said.

Concerns about soaring imports of Chinese EVs prompted the European Union to open an investigation late last year into Chinaís state support for EV makers. The auto industry is a major employer in Europe and crucial to the regionís biggest economy, Germany, which is home to Volkswagen, Audi and BMW.

EV sales in China will account for almost 60% of the global total this year and about 45% of all car sales in the country.

By 2030, almost one in three cars on the roads in China is set to be electric, up from fewer than one in 10 last year, according to the IEA. That compares with its forecast for 17% in the United States and 18% in the European Union, compared with just over 2% and almost 4% respectively last year.

ìThis shift will have major ramifications for both the auto industry and the energy sector,î Birol said. The IEA sees global oil demand peaking in 2030, helped by the electrification of the transport sector.

In addition to affordability, another barrier to mass adoption of electric cars is a lack of public charging infrastructure in Europe and the United States.

Under current government policies, the number of public EV charging points worldwide is expected to reach 15 million by the end of the decade, a near-fourfold increase from last year, according to the IEA.",23-Apr-25,Business,Hanna Ziady,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/23/cars/electric-vehicle-sales-forecast-iea,,,,,,,,,,,,global electric vehicle sales set rise fifth reach million year powered drivers china according international energy agency report tuesday iea projected ‚Äúsurging demand‚Äù evs next decade set ‚Äúto remake global auto industry significantly reduce oil consumption road transport‚Äù expects half cars sold globally electric one five year provided charging infrastructure keeps pace iea includes battery electric vehicles plugin hybrid vehicles definition evs agency‚Äôs bullish longterm outlook evs ‚Äî based current government policies ‚Äî comes just days world‚Äôs biggest battery ev maker tesla slashed prices major markets counter declining sales growing competition chinese upstarts established carmakers recent negative headlines slowing ev penetration step positive global trends according iea executive director fatih birol data ‚Äúdoes show reverse growth electric cars shows extremely robust increase global electric car sales‚Äù told reporters tuesday growth driven just chinese buyers number new battery electric cars sold european union rose almost first quarter year compared period according european automobile manufacturers‚Äô association statement birol said ‚Äúrather tapering global ev revolution appears gearing new phase growth‚Äù despite upbeat trends ev makers grappling slim profit margins squeezed price wars competition heats past days tesla chinese ev maker li auto cut prices major models china world‚Äôs biggest ev market tesla also cutting prices germany united states earlier month tesla posted first annual drop sales nearly four years company‚Äôs stock plunged far year china‚Äôs byd also stumbled briefly surpassed tesla global market leader sales falling first quarter final three months automakers may hurting price cuts crucial increasing takeup evs around world according iea emphasized ‚Äúpace transition evs‚Ä¶ hinge affordability‚Äù china evs sold last year less expensive conventional cars europe united states purchase price new cars internal combustion engines remains lower average ‚Äúintensifying market competition improving battery technologies expected reduce ev prices coming years‚Äù iea said ‚Äúgrowing electric car exports chinese automakers accounted half electric car sales add downward pressure purchase prices‚Äù added last year chinese carmakers accounted half global electric car sales compared share conventional car market ‚Äúchina de facto leader electric car manufacturing around world‚Äù birol said concerns soaring imports chinese evs prompted european union open investigation late last year china‚Äôs state support ev makers auto industry major employer europe crucial region‚Äôs biggest economy germany home volkswagen audi bmw ev sales china account almost global total year car sales country almost one three cars roads china set electric fewer one last year according iea compares forecast united states european union compared just almost respectively last year ‚Äúthis shift major ramifications auto industry energy sector‚Äù birol said iea sees global oil demand peaking helped electrification transport sector addition affordability another barrier mass adoption electric cars lack public charging infrastructure europe united states current government policies number public ev charging points worldwide expected reach million end decade nearfourfold increase last year according iea
Top soccer clubs are using an AI-powered app to scout future stars,"
A London-based technology company is looking to ìdemocratizeî talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app.

Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them.

Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch.

The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills.

ìWeíre putting that data up front to make better use of [the scoutsí] time,î said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app.

ìTo say [to scouts], ëGo over to this place today because thereís three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standardí ó thatís going to be the best use of your time.íî

It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract with EPL team Bournemouth in 2021.

ëItís more about evolutioní
Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app ó which fully launched in September 2023 ó according to Felton-Thomas.

Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year.

Felton-Thomas said the ìlionís shareî of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for ìtier oneî sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid.

The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at $2.7 billion in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research.

Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods.

ìItís more about evolution than revolution,î Felton-Thomas explained.

ìWe canít tell you when that playerís actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when heís 2-0 down? What happens when someoneís shouting at him? What happens when heís just made a massive mistake?î

While football remains ai.ioís primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports.

ìYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,î Felton-Thomas told CNN.",1-Mar-25,Business,Jack Bantock,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl,,,,,,,,,,,,londonbased technology company looking ‚Äúdemocratize‚Äù talentidentification scouting soccer using mobile app free download available globally aiscout app allows aspiring soccer stars enter virtual trials professional clubs uploading selfrecorded footage completing series drills offers exercises designed test range skills videos showing users complete performances automatically scored artificial intelligence ai technology data can accessed clubs allowing scouts peruse scores viable talent honing search variety filters age gender position pitch app currently two english premier league epl partners chelsea burnley clubs can tailor inapp trials meet specific needs set benchmarks academy players complete drills ‚Äúwe‚Äôre putting data front make better use scouts‚Äô time‚Äù said richard feltonthomas chief operating officer aiio company behind app ‚Äúto say scouts ‚Äògo place today there‚Äôs three players game actually beating chelsea standard‚Äô ‚Äî that‚Äôs going best use time‚Äô‚Äù already appears working ben greenwood never trial professional club downloaded app uploading footage yearold landed trial chelsea becoming first user app get trial pro club signed contract epl team bournemouth ‚Äòit‚Äôs evolution‚Äô betatested players spanning countries greenwood among players trialed signed pro clubs national teams app ‚Äî fully launched september ‚Äî according feltonthomas just players make current database clubs lined join chelsea burnley well multiyear partnership major league soccer us announced last may feltonthomas projects user numbers surge millions operation ramps year feltonthomas said ‚Äúlion‚Äôs share‚Äù income comes charging clubs license fee run platform annual fees vary depending size club tools require ranging six figures ‚Äútier one‚Äù sides like chelsea thousands pounds clubs lower footballing pyramid use smart technology sport continues expand including ai commentary tools wearable tech elite athletes global market sports analytics valued billion projected grow end decade according market research firm grand view research soccer talent scouts concerned edged arrival ai industry feltonthomas new technologies can coexist traditional methods ‚Äúit‚Äôs evolution revolution‚Äù feltonthomas explained ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt tell player‚Äôs actually match deal adversity happens he‚Äôs happens someone‚Äôs shouting happens he‚Äôs just made massive mistake‚Äù football remains aiio‚Äôs primary focus company looking opportunities sports launch coming years ahead may branch beyond sports ‚Äúyou think notion can home analyze movements spin health care physical assessments military disciplines emergency services‚Äù feltonthomas told cnn
Americas largest real estate brokerages are fighting over private listings,"When a deal to buy Caitlin Bigelowís San Francisco condo fell through last month, she felt relief, rather than disappointment.

Bigelow was working with a real estate agent she trusted from Compass who had suggested she first list her home as a ìCompass Private Exclusive.î That meant her home wouldnít immediately be publicly advertised on home-search websites like Zillow or Redfin. Instead, the listing would be announced internally at Compass, one of Americaís largest real estate brokerages, meaning only buyers represented by other Compass agents knew the home was for sale.

Bigelow had received two offers from this method ó including one for $2.1 million, which was $95,000 over her list price.

It was the ìmagic numberî she had in mind, and she quickly accepted. At first, she was thrilled. But after having time to think, she began to feel a sense of unease.

ìOnly two people had seen (the home) and we seemed to be hitting our magic number already,î Bigelow told CNN. ìThe longer I sat with that, the more I felt like, well, if two people saw it and we hit the number, what if 50 people saw it?î

Bigelowís question gets at the heart of a dispute roiling the residential real estate industry. After a landmark settlement last year by the industryís powerful trade association, the National Association of Realtors, the battle over private and exclusive listings has become the latest fight about the way homes are bought and sold in America.

What is a private listing?
There are legitimate reasons why someone might list their home out of the public eye, Summer Goralik, a real estate compliance consultant, told CNN. For example, celebrities and other public figures may not want to advertise their homeís address or photos.

But with US homebuyer demand significantly outstripping supply over the last few years, private listings across the market could mean only select buyers get first dibs on in-demand homes.

Although Compass is not the only brokerage that lists homes off-market, the practice has become a signature part of how its agents market home listings. And it has prompted backlash: Other leaders in the residential real estate industry argue the practice is exclusionary and threatens to further chip away at consumer trust in real estate agents.

ìIf a portion of inventory is removed and only shown to a small group of people, by definition, thatís an exclusionary behavior thatís going to hurt others,î said Leo Pareja, the CEO of eXp Realty, another one of Americaís largest real estate brokerages.

He said his company only handles private transactions when itís required in special situations: ìFewer than 1,000 transactions for us last year were private exclusives out of 350,000.î

Critics also say the private listing strategy unfairly pushes home sellers to make deals with buyers represented by other Compass agents, resulting in the brokerage collecting a commission from both sides of the transaction.

Compass has denied the accusation that it pushes sellers into private transactions. Instead, the company said many sellers choose to list their homes privately before sharing their homes more widely on the multiple listing service (MLS), which is a database that agents from all companies use to share home listings with each other. Most MLS listings are automatically picked up by homebuying websites like Zillow and Redfin.

ìHome sellers deserve choice in how their home is marketed,î a Compass spokesperson wrote to CNN in a statement. ìThey should be able to choose the best strategy for selling their homes, whether that means starting with marketing privately or publicly before listing in the MLS or listing on the MLS from day one.î

Compass often employs its ì3-phased marketing strategyî for home sellers. It begins with a private listing to ìtestî a homeís sales price. Then, during the ìcoming soonî phase, listings are showcased on Compassí website to generate buyer interest before they ìofficiallyî hit the market. The final phase is to ìgo live on all platforms,î meaning sellers list their home online for all real estate agents and home shoppers.

As of mid-February, approximately 35% of all Compassí listings were listed as ìCompass Private Exclusiveî or ìCompass Coming Soon,î CEO Robert Reffkin said on Compassí most recent earnings call.

Compass said 94% of its private listings last year ultimately sold on the public market.

ìIf this plan to market off the MLS is literally driven by client need, then 100% that should be the journey,î Goralik said. ìBut on the flip side, if itís not driven by the seller, and the listing pitch is about why your property needs to be off the MLS before that discussion even comes upÖ that just dirties the water all the way through.î

An increasingly fragmented housing market where buyers can only find certain homes for sale depending on their agent hurts both buyers and sellers, Goralik told CNN.

ìThen that wasnít the sellerís choice. That wasnít even directed by the seller,î she added. ìI just think thatís going backwards. Thatís not moving toward the future.î

CEOs trade barbs
Last week, Ryan Schneider, CEO of Anywhere Real Estate, which includes real estate companies such as Coldwell Banker, Century 21 and Sothebyís International Realty, weighed in on the dispute on his companyís earnings call last week.

ìAnywhere Real Estate is aggressively advocating for transparency and the broad and public distribution of nearly all listings because we believe it is best for buyers to see all the inventory, and most critically, it helps sellers get the highest price for their home,î he said on Tuesday.

In April, though, Corcoran, another subsidiary of Anywhere Real Estate, rolled out Corcoran Reserve, a private listing network for sellers who want to prioritize ìgreater privacy and discretion.î

ìWe are advocating for the broad distribution of listings in almost all cases, and we donít believe that this self-serving debate has the best interests of the consumer at heart,î Anywhere Real Estate said in a statement to CNN a few weeks after Corcoran Reserve was launched.

Douglas Elliman, a separate brokerage, plans to roll out its own private listing network, though the company told CNN that it is just one of multiple selling strategies for home sellers.

Pareja has been vocal in his opposition of private listings.

ìIf I were being a pure capitalist, I would be on the other side of the argument, because I would be able to hoard inventoryÖ. But Iím not. Instead, Iím saying, ëHey guys, this is not good for the consumer,íî he told CNN.

Compass pushes back
Last month, Zillow and Redfin ó two of the most popular platforms for home sale searches ó announced new rules that complicate Compassí strategy.

While it doesnít directly prohibit private listings, Zillow said that a home listing that is marketed to consumers must be published to Zillow within one day, or it wonít be published at all. Beginning in late May, ìcoming soonî listings that are advertised on other real estate websites will need to be published on Zillow within 24 hours.

Redfin announced a similar policy shortly afterward.

Reffkin has defended the strategy of keeping listings off platforms like Zillow and Redfin to start. Both sites publicly show price cut history and how many days homes sit on the market ó two data points the Compass CEO has argued hurt a homeís sales price.

ìCompass has achieved everything it has without banning homeowners who donít give us their listings,î one of Reffkinís recent social media posts read. ìWhy canít Zillow and Redfin do that

Millennials are giving Gen Z advice for their first potential recession,"Millennials have been through a lot.

Many of the generation were young adults when the Great Recession began, and to this day, they struggle to buy homes and pay off student debt. Now these jaded millennials are sharing their wisdom with Gen Z on TikTok, posting preparation tips and no-buy lists to ease the minds of young people who could be entering their first major recession as adults.

President Donald Trumpís whiplash-inducing policy changes have everyone warning about dire consequences for the US economy, from Fed Chair Jerome Powell to Goldman Sachs analysts. The Trump administrationís tit-for-tat escalation in the global trade war could lead to a recession for both the US and the world this year, JPMorgan said this month. It comes during an already unprecedented string of events for young people ó people in their early 20s are earning less and have more debt, already battered by the Covid-19 pandemic and an onslaught of inflation.

So, the United States might not be in a recession right now, but its youngest working adults are still anxious ó and seeking advice from their older peers.

When scrolling through TikTok, Sasha Whitney, 37, noticed Gen Z users shared the same feelings over an impending recession: ìdowntrodden, frustrated, very bleak and hopeless about the future.î

Itís a stark difference from when Whitney graduated from college in 2009 during the Great Recession, before social media became as pervasive and when Barack Obama, who ran his campaign on the concept of hope, just took office.

ìWhen I talked to some of my millennial friends, they were like, ëYeah, we were broke. We were struggling,íî said Whitney, whose primary audience on TikTok is aged 18 to 25 years old. ìHowever, we werenít trying to keep up with the Joneses. You werenít trying to portray a lifestyle for social media.î

Other millennials joked on social media about the sense of community they had during the recession, sounding nostalgic for the days of cheaper liquor, wearing business casual and endless replays of feel-good recession pop. ìIf you want to know how we survived, yeah we blacked out,î one millennial user quipped on TikTok.

But millennials did share their real financial struggles. After graduating, Whitney lived at home for a bit, then moved out, paying rent and student loans and leaving $20 a week for groceries. She worked in retail immediately out of college and figured out how to handle her finances through trial and error.

ìIím buying packs of tuna, frozen vegetables, bread, putting it in the freezer. Thatís when it really hit me that somethingís going on,î she said.

Whitneyís TikTok video walked viewers through some recession tips, including: taking whatever job you can get, living below your means, and deleting payment platforms like Klarna and After Pay. Other videos from millennials on TikTok offer recession preparation guides, such has having an emergency savings fund and updated resumes.

ìIf I can give somebody advice, especially younger folks, thatís what Iím going to do,î Whitney said.

Living below your means
Many TikTokers are vowing to do one thing: limit their spending.

For Imani Smith, a 29-year-old in Dallas, that means password-sharing subscriptions with her friends and cutting back on going out to eat.

Beauty maintenance is also a high cost, so she buys press-on nails from Amazon instead of going to the salon. Salon owners are reporting more requests for ìrecession blonde,î cheaper, more low-maintenance hairstyles.

And despite the famous lipstick index ó the theory that small ìtreat yourselfî purchases uptick during economic downturns ó social media users have promised to cut out small purchases like expensive lip balms and candles.

ìI want to (save) and build a practice of doing it before I have to do it out of basic necessity,î Smith, who described herself as in between a Gen Z and millennial, told CNN. She added that she uses TikTok, like many young people, as a search engine. In a video on TikTok, she asked viewers who were adults in 2008 whether her recession plan was good enough.

When people sense their budgets contracting, they have to decide what theyíre going to spend on, Simon Blanchard, a professor at Georgetown Universityís McDonough School of Business, said to CNN. He added it may be a good time to self-reflect if you have enough emergency savings, whether weíre in a recession or not.

People tend to cut an entire category of spending rather than a little bit of everything, so it doesnít seem like they have to downgrade on every part of their life, Blanchard said.

ìAnd maybe those small indulgences like lipstick are the things that might be first to go because theyíre just non-essential,î Blanchard said.

For Gen Z, more anxiety and uncertainty
Despite the advice from millennials to let go and live, as all the great music of the mid-2000s encouraged, anxiety still persists among many young people.

After talking to people who lived through 2008, Smith said that ìthey mightíve lost their jobs, but the cost of living was so low back then that they could have picked up something retail and held themselves afloat for a while,î emphasizing her worries for the job market right now.

For many young people, their anxiety goes back to the Covid-19 pandemic. Smith had just started working her first corporate job when the pandemic hit, triggering the shortest recession in US history that ended after two months in April 2020.

ìIt put me in the mindset that I need to be prepared for anything,î Smith said. ìBecause none of us could have anticipated Covid-19 and the lasting effects that had.î",27-Apr-25,Business,Ramishah Maruf,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/27/business/millennials-gen-z-recession-advice,,,,,,,,,,,,millennials lot many generation young adults great recession began day struggle buy homes pay student debt now jaded millennials sharing wisdom gen z tiktok posting preparation tips nobuy lists ease minds young people entering first major recession adults president donald trump‚Äôs whiplashinducing policy changes everyone warning dire consequences us economy fed chair jerome powell goldman sachs analysts trump administration‚Äôs titfortat escalation global trade war lead recession us world year jpmorgan said month comes already unprecedented string events young people ‚Äî people early s earning less debt already battered covid pandemic onslaught inflation united states might recession right now youngest working adults still anxious ‚Äî seeking advice older peers scrolling tiktok sasha whitney noticed gen z users shared feelings impending recession ‚Äúdowntrodden frustrated bleak hopeless future‚Äù it‚Äôs stark difference whitney graduated college great recession social media became pervasive barack obama ran campaign concept hope just took office ‚Äúwhen talked millennial friends like ‚Äòyeah broke struggling‚Äô‚Äù said whitney whose primary audience tiktok aged years old ‚Äúhowever weren‚Äôt trying keep joneses weren‚Äôt trying portray lifestyle social media‚Äù millennials joked social media sense community recession sounding nostalgic days cheaper liquor wearing business casual endless replays feelgood recession pop ‚Äúif want know survived yeah blacked out‚Äù one millennial user quipped tiktok millennials share real financial struggles graduating whitney lived home bit moved paying rent student loans leaving week groceries worked retail immediately college figured handle finances trial error ‚Äúi‚Äôm buying packs tuna frozen vegetables bread putting freezer that‚Äôs really hit something‚Äôs going on‚Äù said whitney‚Äôs tiktok video walked viewers recession tips including taking whatever job can get living means deleting payment platforms like klarna pay videos millennials tiktok offer recession preparation guides emergency savings fund updated resumes ‚Äúif can give somebody advice especially younger folks that‚Äôs i‚Äôm going do‚Äù whitney said living means many tiktokers vowing one thing limit spending imani smith yearold dallas means passwordsharing subscriptions friends cutting back going eat beauty maintenance also high cost buys presson nails amazon instead going salon salon owners reporting requests ‚Äúrecession blonde‚Äù cheaper lowmaintenance hairstyles despite famous lipstick index ‚Äî theory small ‚Äútreat yourself‚Äù purchases uptick economic downturns ‚Äî social media users promised cut small purchases like expensive lip balms candles ‚Äúi want save build practice basic necessity‚Äù smith described gen z millennial told cnn added uses tiktok like many young people search engine video tiktok asked viewers adults whether recession plan good enough people sense budgets contracting decide they‚Äôre going spend simon blanchard professor georgetown university‚Äôs mcdonough school business said cnn added may good time selfreflect enough emergency savings whether we‚Äôre recession people tend cut entire category spending rather little bit everything doesn‚Äôt seem like downgrade every part life blanchard said ‚Äúand maybe small indulgences like lipstick things might first go they‚Äôre just nonessential‚Äù blanchard said gen z anxiety uncertainty despite advice millennials let go live great music mids encouraged anxiety still persists among many young people talking people lived smith said ‚Äúthey might‚Äôve lost jobs cost living low back picked something retail held afloat while‚Äù emphasizing worries job market right now many young people anxiety goes back covid pandemic smith just started working first corporate job pandemic hit triggering shortest recession us history ended two months april ‚Äúit put mindset need prepared anything‚Äù smith said ‚Äúbecause none us anticipated covid lasting effects had‚Äù
Has the stock market hit bottom? History is a guide,"US stocks soared Wednesday, but the S&P 500 is still trying to climb out of a slump instigated by President Donald Trumpís trade war.

After hitting a record high in February, the S&P 500 dropped into correction in March as Trump unveiled his plan for tariffs. The benchmark index as of Wednesday was still down 12.5% from its peak two months ago. (A 10% decline from a peak is considered a correction. A 20% decline from a peak is considered a bear market).

The S&P 500 has shed $6.5 trillion in market value since its record high in February, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.

As stocks have gyrated, investors are wondering when the market might find a bottom.

The truth is: No one can know for sure.

The market hit its lowest closing price this year on April 8, down 18.9% from its February peak. The S&P 500 has yet to test that low again, and itís anyoneís guess whether the market continues climbing higher.

While uncertainty is rife, history can serve as a guide as to when the S&P 500 might find a bottom.

Four months to bottom, historically
The S&P has had 24 corrections since the end of World War II, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. Historically, when the S&P entered correction but did not enter a bear market, it took the index an average of 133 days to find a bottom, and an average of 113 days to recover.

If April 8 turns out to be the marketís bottom, it would be just 48 days from Februaryís peak to bottom ó much faster than the historical average.

Additionally, it has historically taken the S&P 500 an average of 77 days to go from a peak to confirming a correction, according to Stovall. This year, it took the benchmark index just 22 days to confirm a correction (a peak on February 19 to a correction on March 13), which is also much faster than the historical average.

Typically, when there is a sharp decline from a peak to correction, the slump tends to be relatively short before the market recovers, according to Stovall.

ìSwift declines tend to be shallow and short-lived,î he said. ìHistory is a great guide, but itís never gospel, so weíll have to wait and see whether that will hold true.î

And vast uncertainty looms. The market correction this year has been driven by the White Houseís policy, Stovall said, which is historically rare.

ìThe only problem is that this is what I call a manufactured correction, meaning that it started because Trump initiated a trade war,î he said. ìIt is because of what the current administration is doing.î

ìThe patient, disciplined, policy-based investor ultimately is going to be rewarded over the long run,î Abugideiri said. ìThatís the way the market makes you work for the returns. Youíve got to be patient; youíve got to be disciplined.î

Younger investors with long-term goals should see a market correction as a buying opportunity while stocks are on sale, he said. Meanwhile, if you are approaching retirement, diversifying your portfolio into more Treasuries and cash equivalents like money market funds can help protect your investments.

While a variety of factors influence finding a bottom, Abugideiri said, the outlook for the market largely hinges on investors getting more clarity from the White House.

ìIf investors get more clarity and have to deal with less uncertainty, markets are going to react favorably,î Abugideiri said.",24-Apr-25,Business,John Towfighi,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/24/investing/us-stock-market-bottom,,,,,,,,,,,,us stocks soared wednesday sp still trying climb slump instigated president donald trump‚Äôs trade war hitting record high february sp dropped correction march trump unveiled plan tariffs benchmark index wednesday still peak two months ago decline peak considered correction decline peak considered bear market sp shed trillion market value since record high february according howard silverblatt senior index analyst sp dow jones indices stocks gyrated investors wondering market might find bottom truth one can know sure market hit lowest closing price year april february peak sp yet test low it‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess whether market continues climbing higher uncertainty rife history can serve guide sp might find bottom four months bottom historically sp corrections since end world war ii according sam stovall chief investment strategist cfra research historically sp entered correction enter bear market took index average days find bottom average days recover april turns market‚Äôs bottom just days february‚Äôs peak bottom ‚Äî much faster historical average additionally historically taken sp average days go peak confirming correction according stovall year took benchmark index just days confirm correction peak february correction march also much faster historical average typically sharp decline peak correction slump tends relatively short market recovers according stovall ‚Äúswift declines tend shallow shortlived‚Äù said ‚Äúhistory great guide it‚Äôs never gospel we‚Äôll wait see whether hold true‚Äù vast uncertainty looms market correction year driven white house‚Äôs policy stovall said historically rare ‚Äúthe problem call manufactured correction meaning started trump initiated trade war‚Äù said ‚Äúit current administration doing‚Äù four months bottom historically sp corrections since end world war ii according sam stovall chief investment strategist cfra research historically sp entered correction enter bear market took index average days find bottom average days recover april turns market‚Äôs bottom just days february‚Äôs peak bottom ‚Äî much faster historical average additionally historically taken sp average days go peak confirming correction according stovall year took benchmark index just days confirm correction peak february correction march also much faster historical average typically sharp decline peak correction slump tends relatively short market recovers according stovall ‚Äúswift declines tend shallow shortlived‚Äù said ‚Äúhistory great guide it‚Äôs never gospel we‚Äôll wait see whether hold true‚Äù vast uncertainty looms market correction year driven white house‚Äôs policy stovall said historically rare ‚Äúthe problem call manufactured correction meaning started trump initiated trade war‚Äù said ‚Äúit current administration doing‚Äù ‚Äúthe patient disciplined policybased investor ultimately going rewarded long run‚Äù abugideiri said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs way market makes work returns you‚Äôve got patient you‚Äôve got disciplined‚Äù younger investors longterm goals see market correction buying opportunity stocks sale said meanwhile approaching retirement diversifying portfolio treasuries cash equivalents like money market funds can help protect investments variety factors influence finding bottom abugideiri said outlook market largely hinges investors getting clarity white house ‚Äúif investors get clarity deal less uncertainty markets going react favorably‚Äù abugideiri said
"Trumps trade war will hit US prosperity hard, IMF warns","President Donald Trumpís unpredictable tariff policy and countermeasures by Americaís trading partners will likely deal a heavy blow to economies worldwide, with US prosperity hit particularly hard, the International Monetary Fund warned Tuesday.

Global economic growth will slow to 2.8% this year, from 3.3% last year and significantly below the historical average, the IMF forecast in its World Economic Outlook report.

The slowdown expected in the United States is even steeper, with its economy likely to grow only 1.8% in 2025, compared with a 2.8% expansion in 2024.

Both predictions are more pessimistic than the fundís January projections, which came before Trumpís flurry of tariff announcements took Americaís average import tax to its highest level in a century.

ìThe swift escalation of trade tensions and extremely high levels of policy uncertainty are expected to have a significant impact on global economic activity,î the Washington, DC-based institution said. And risks to the global economy are ìfirmly tilted to the downside,î it added.

Trumpís new tariffs account for almost half of the sharp downgrade in the IMFís US growth forecast for this year, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMFís chief economist, wrote in a blog post, noting that uncertainty over policy dented demand in the US even before the recent tariff announcements.

North America, just like all regions, canít expect any upside from the tariffs further down the line. ìThe long-term impact of the tariffs, if they are maintained, (will be) negative for all regions, just like the short-term impacts,î Gourinchas told reporters Tuesday.

Gourinchas also said that ìcentral bank independence remains a cornerstone.î The comment comes just a day after Trump attacked US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as a ìmajor loser,î part of his continuing campaign to pressure the central bank chief to cut interest rates.

Lowering borrowing costs at this point would risk pushing up US inflation, which is still running above the Fedís 2% target and is likely to rise further because of Trumpís tariffs, according to many forecasters.

The IMF has grown gloomier on US prices and now sees inflation hitting 3% this year, compared with its January forecast of 2%.

The latest World Economic Outlook was put together under ìexceptionalî circumstances, the IMF said. Trumpís unveiling of sweeping tariffs on April 2 ìforced us to jettison our projections ó nearly finalized at that point,î it wrote.

Similarly, Gourinchas told reporters: ìWeíre entering a new era as the global economic system that has operated for the last 80 years is being reset.î

Underscoring the importance of trade to the economic outlook, the IMF said in its report that a ratcheting up of trade tensions, along with even more questions about where trade policies are headed, could further reduce growth, whereas ìde-escalation from current tariff rates and new agreements providing clarity and stability in trade policiesî could do the opposite.

In an interview, Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, voiced a similar view of trade. ìFree trade has always enhanced the overall growth, has been a serious contributor to the development of all economies,î she told CNBC Tuesday.

She said higher tariffs will have a negative impact on Europeís economic growth, although she doesnít expect a recession in the 20 countries that use the euro.",22-Apr-25,Business,Olesya Dmitracova,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/22/economy/imf-us-global-economies-tariffs-intl,,,,,,,,,,,,president donald trump‚Äôs unpredictable tariff policy countermeasures america‚Äôs trading partners likely deal heavy blow economies worldwide us prosperity hit particularly hard international monetary fund warned tuesday global economic growth slow year last year significantly historical average imf forecast world economic outlook report slowdown expected united states even steeper economy likely grow compared expansion predictions pessimistic fund‚Äôs january projections came trump‚Äôs flurry tariff announcements took america‚Äôs average import tax highest level century ‚Äúthe swift escalation trade tensions extremely high levels policy uncertainty expected significant impact global economic activity‚Äù washington dcbased institution said risks global economy ‚Äúfirmly tilted downside‚Äù added trump‚Äôs new tariffs account almost half sharp downgrade imf‚Äôs us growth forecast year pierreolivier gourinchas imf‚Äôs chief economist wrote blog post noting uncertainty policy dented demand us even recent tariff announcements north america just like regions can‚Äôt expect upside tariffs line ‚Äúthe longterm impact tariffs maintained negative regions just like shortterm impacts‚Äù gourinchas told reporters tuesday gourinchas also said ‚Äúcentral bank independence remains cornerstone‚Äù comment comes just day trump attacked us federal reserve chair jerome powell ‚Äúmajor loser‚Äù part continuing campaign pressure central bank chief cut interest rates lowering borrowing costs point risk pushing us inflation still running fed‚Äôs target likely rise trump‚Äôs tariffs according many forecasters imf grown gloomier us prices now sees inflation hitting year compared january forecast latest world economic outlook put together ‚Äúexceptional‚Äù circumstances imf said trump‚Äôs unveiling sweeping tariffs april ‚Äúforced us jettison projections ‚Äî nearly finalized point‚Äù wrote similarly gourinchas told reporters ‚Äúwe‚Äôre entering new era global economic system operated last years reset‚Äù underscoring importance trade economic outlook imf said report ratcheting trade tensions along even questions trade policies headed reduce growth whereas ‚Äúdeescalation current tariff rates new agreements providing clarity stability trade policies‚Äù opposite interview christine lagarde president european central bank voiced similar view trade ‚Äúfree trade always enhanced overall growth serious contributor development economies‚Äù told cnbc tuesday said higher tariffs negative impact europe‚Äôs economic growth although doesn‚Äôt expect recession countries use euro
Scott Bessent says tariff rates will return to reciprocal levels if countries don't reach trade deals with US,"Tariff rates will soon return to a ìreciprocalî level if countries donít reach trade agreements during the 90-day pause, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday.

ìPresident Trump has put them on notice that if you do not negotiate in good faith, you will ratchet back up to your April 2 level,î Bessent said on CNNís ìState of the Union with Jake Tapper.î

There are 18 ìimportantî trading partners that the United States is most focused on solidifying deals with, Bessent said. He did not say how quickly tariff rates could revert to ìreciprocalî rates.

ìThere are a lot of smaller trading relationships that we can just come up with a number. My other sense is that we will do a lot of regional deals ó ëthis is the rate for Central America, this is the rate for this part of Africa,íî Bessent added.

President Donald Trump announced a slate of ìreciprocalî tariffs on April 2, which he called ìLiberation Day.î He later paused those levies for 90 days, which lowered rates to a baseline rate of 10%.

On Friday, Trump said that time is running out for countries to make a trade deal with the United States.

ìWe have, at the same time, 150 countries that want to make a deal, but youíre not able to see that many countries,î Trump said during a business roundtable in Abu Dhabi. ìSo at a certain point, over the next two to three weeks, I think (Bessent) and (Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick) will be sending letters out, essentially telling people ó weíll be very fair ó but weíll be telling people what theyíll be paying to do business in the United States.î

Markets soared on Monday after Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer outlined a temporary de-escalation of a trade war with China in Geneva, Switzerland, with the United States lowering tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, and China lowering duties on US goods from 125% to 10%. The S&P 500 last week surged 5.3% with five consecutive sessions of gains.

Tariffs put pressure on businesses, consumers
Bessent was also asked about the whiplash and uncertainty caused by Trumpís tariffs. He responded that the administrationís negotiating tactic is ìstrategic uncertainty.î

ìIf we were to give too much certainty to the other countries, then they would play us in the negotiations. I am confident that at the end of these negotiations, both the retailers, the American people and the American workers will be better off,î Bessent said.

When asked about the impact tariffs will have on small businesses that rely on products made in China, Bessent responded that he thinks the United States ìwill continue trading with China in the kinds of products that these small businesses are talking about at lower tariff levels.î

Many American small businesses face serious risks, as costs have skyrocketed and growth plans are uncertain due to fluctuating tariff rates.

Companies pass on tariff costs to customers by raising prices to avoid narrowing margins, a notion the Trump administration has repeatedly disputed.

Retail giant Walmart is among the most recent American companies that warned of price increases. On Saturday, Trump told the company in a post to Truth Social to ìeat the tariffs.î

Bessent said he spoke directly with Walmart CEO Doug McMillon on Saturday.

ìWalmart will be absorbing some of the tariffs, some may get passed on to consumers,î Bessent said.

The US loses its last perfect credit rating
Moodyís Ratings on Friday downgraded the United Statesí debt, which held an outstanding rating of AAA. Moodyís dropped the US debt rating to Aa1, joining the two other major credit rating agencies Fitch Ratings and S&P, which lowered ratings for US debt in 2023 and 2011, respectively. Moodyís cited concerns about the nationís growing $36 trillion debt amid gridlock in Congress over a White House budget bill that the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates would add $3.3 trillion to the debt in the next 10 years.

Bessent told CNN on Sunday that he ìdoes not put much credence in the Moodyísî downgrade.

The downgrade could lead more investors to believe lending money to the government is more risky, potentially causing US Treasury yields to rise. The US Treasuries, particularly the 10-year US Treasury, influence various debt, including mortgage rates for American homes and contracts written around the world.",18-May-25,Business,Jordan Valinsky,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/18/business/scott-bessent-trump-tariffs-china,,,,,,,,,,,,tariff rates soon return ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù level countries don‚Äôt reach trade agreements day pause treasury secretary scott bessent said sunday ‚Äúpresident trump put notice negotiate good faith ratchet back april level‚Äù bessent said cnn‚Äôs ‚Äústate union jake tapper‚Äù ‚Äúimportant‚Äù trading partners united states focused solidifying deals bessent said say quickly tariff rates revert ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù rates ‚Äúthere lot smaller trading relationships can just come number sense lot regional deals ‚Äî ‚Äòthis rate central america rate part africa‚Äô‚Äù bessent added president donald trump announced slate ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù tariffs april called ‚Äúliberation day‚Äù later paused levies days lowered rates baseline rate friday trump said time running countries make trade deal united states ‚Äúwe time countries want make deal you‚Äôre able see many countries‚Äù trump said business roundtable abu dhabi ‚Äúso certain point next two three weeks think bessent commerce secretary howard lutnick sending letters essentially telling people ‚Äî we‚Äôll fair ‚Äî we‚Äôll telling people they‚Äôll paying business united states‚Äù markets soared monday bessent us trade representative jamieson greer outlined temporary deescalation trade war china geneva switzerland united states lowering tariffs chinese imports china lowering duties us goods sp last week surged five consecutive sessions gains tariffs put pressure businesses consumers bessent also asked whiplash uncertainty caused trump‚Äôs tariffs responded administration‚Äôs negotiating tactic ‚Äústrategic uncertainty‚Äù ‚Äúif give much certainty countries play us negotiations confident end negotiations retailers american people american workers better off‚Äù bessent said asked impact tariffs small businesses rely products made china bessent responded thinks united states ‚Äúwill continue trading china kinds products small businesses talking lower tariff levels‚Äù many american small businesses face serious risks costs skyrocketed growth plans uncertain due fluctuating tariff rates companies pass tariff costs customers raising prices avoid narrowing margins notion trump administration repeatedly disputed retail giant walmart among recent american companies warned price increases saturday trump told company post truth social ‚Äúeat tariffs‚Äù bessent said spoke directly walmart ceo doug mcmillon saturday ‚Äúwalmart absorbing tariffs may get passed consumers‚Äù bessent said us loses last perfect credit rating moody‚Äôs ratings friday downgraded united states‚Äô debt held outstanding rating aaa moody‚Äôs dropped us debt rating aa joining two major credit rating agencies fitch ratings sp lowered ratings us debt respectively moody‚Äôs cited concerns nation‚Äôs growing trillion debt amid gridlock congress white house budget bill committee responsible federal budget estimates add trillion debt next years bessent told cnn sunday ‚Äúdoes put much credence moody‚Äôs‚Äù downgrade downgrade lead investors believe lending money government risky potentially causing us treasury yields rise us treasuries particularly year us treasury influence various debt including mortgage rates american homes contracts written around world
Worried how to pay for college? Here's how to maximize your chances of getting the aid you need,"Getting into college can be hard.

But figuring out how to finance college so that neither parent nor child are left financially hard up? Itís a new, highly annoying level of hard ó at least if you hope to get an adequate financial aid package to supplement your and your childís college savings.

For any parent with a child in the 8th, 9th or 10th grade, now is the time to strategize how to maximize your access to both merit-based and need-based financial aid.

Where things stand now
The cost of one year in college for one child ó never mind two or more ó is always eye-popping.

For this academic year (2024-2025) the average annual sticker price for a private, four-year college including tuition, housing, food, supplies, transportation and the always mysterious ìotherî is $62,990, according to the College Board.

For a four-year program at a public state university, the average came to $29,910 for in-state students and $49,080 for out-of-staters.

The good news: The ìnetî price of a year of college can be much less, once you account for federal and school aid (both need-based and merit-based), coupled with scholarships and federally subsidized loans.

But just how much less depends, among other things, on your family income, how well youíve strategized withdrawing your savings for college, and ó this is key, college experts say ó whether your childís academic performance puts them in a schoolís top 25% of incoming freshmen.

Another consideration may soon be what Congress will do. House Republicans are considering a proposal that would, among other things, end the subsidized loan program for undergraduates and change the rules for getting Pell grants.

Whether the proposal makes it into law is anyoneís guess. But if it does, it will change the calculus for how families fund a college education.

That, coupled with confusion over the Trump administrationís expressed desire to dismantle the Department of Education, has in some ways made Beth Walkerís job a little easier.

As the author of ìBuying College Betterî who counsels families on how to financially plan for college years before a child applies anywhere, Walker said, ìItís never been as easy for me to advocate for taking back control of this purchase ó and thinking about it with a consumer mindset.î

What to do now
There are several things you and your kids can do ahead of time to put you in the best position to pay for college.

Get good grades and test scores: The better your children do scholastically, the more likely it is they will qualify for merit-based aid.

A big key to unlocking merit aid is to get strong standardized test scores (e.g., on the SAT or ACT), said Mike McKinnon, executive director of the National Institute of Certified College Planners.

He strongly advises students to study and take practice tests starting as early as middle school to improve their score before they take the official test in 11th or 12th grade.

Earn college credits ahead of time: McKinnon also recommends that students try to earn college credits or advance placement in a subject while still in high school. Doing so may let them skip certain required college courses or even graduate early, thereby curbing the total cost for their degree.

Among the ways to get that leg up is to take advance placement courses during the school year, college courses during the summer or college-level examination program (CLEP) tests.

Check the colleges your child may be interested in attending to see what credits those schools will recognize.

At the very least, convey to your kids the value of getting their degree sooner rather than later. Roughly 22% of those earning bachelorís degrees take longer than that to graduate, according to the Education Data Initiative.

Be clear-eyed about your budget: When your child is in 8th or 9th grade, start projecting the financial resources you will have available to pay for college.

Todd Fothergill, founder and CEO of Strategies for College, created a free college budgeting calculator called CostHero that lets you input a detailed list of income, savings, expenses and likely federal loans and tax credits to consider when assessing what your family can reasonably afford to pay. It then gives you two budgets based on your inputs ó one in which the parents incur no debt and one in which they do. The results will help you frame your thinking about where you might need to save more or spend less.

ìYou can take the time when your student enters high school and get serious about planning for college. Or you can have the colleges and the government give you the plan they have and itís really expensive,î Fothergill said.

Planning for more than one child in college at the same time: Say you have a 7th grader and a 9th grader. You will be dealing with college bills for six years, and doubly large ones during two of those years when both kids are in school simultaneously. So it pays to strategize especially carefully for those overlap years.

You want to minimize your income in the ìbaseî years ó which is two years ahead of when your child matriculates, Fothergill said. It is information from those two years that is included on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form, which is a key form schools consider when determining your aid package. So, for example, if you plan to sell stocks to help pay for tuition, donít sell them in that two-year window because it may artificially inflate your income during the base years and you may get less aid as a result.

Know too that recent changes to FAFSA rules mean that families with two or more kids in school at once get less of a break than they used to, Fothergill noted.

Also, not all schools make their aid decisions exclusively using FAFSA. Some use the CSS profile from the College Board to determine how much institutional aid to give. And the rules governing how much a family is expected to contribute using the CSS differ from FAFSAís.

So, before applying anywhere, research what governs aid decisions at schools your child may want to attend. And get your childís Student Aid Index number, which is generated by the FAFSA form once completed.

Start looking for scholarships: There is a wide variety of scholarships available at the national, state and local levels and also at individual schools. So do some research to see which ones might be a good fit for your child. The College Board has a free tool that can get you started.

Apply to colleges most likely to give you what you need: There are now many comprehensive, online sites like Niche.com and Dabima.com that let you research every major aspect of a college relevant to potential applicants ó from academics and financial aid to school culture ó and assess how your child compares to the average student at a chosen school.

Niche.com, for instance, provides users with the 25th to 75th percentile range of standardized test scores among students whoíve been admitted. So if your childís score is above that range youíll know they would be in the top quartile. And Niche lets you see, based on GPA and test scores, how your child would rank, relative to accepted students. In addition, it offers a list of Best Value Colleges, which considers many factors, including net price for tuition room and board, student-faculty ratio, student reviews, return on investment for a degree and how likely the lowest-income students are to move up the economic ladder after graduation.

By the end of this year, Fothergill is planning to make another tool he created called ListHero available to consumers. It is currently used by educational consultants to identify the top list of schools that offer the best fit and education for their clients at the most affordable price for them.

While students may still want to apply to ìreachî schools, itís important for families to realize that if their children do get in, it may be a very expensive ride if a childís academic performance lags that of fellow classmates at the school, Fothergill said. ìColleges donít invest [aid] money in the bottom quartile.î",18-May-25,Business,Elisabeth

Trump tells Walmart to eat the tariffs as retailer expects prices to increase," 
President Donald Trump on Saturday said Walmart needs to stop ìtrying to blame tariffsî after the retail giant announced its products would become more expensive.

Walmartís CEO said the price increases were a result of Trumpís tariffs being ìtoo high,î particularly when it came to Chinese goods.

ìWe will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible. But given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we arenít able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins,î Walmart CEO Douglas McMillon said Thursday in an earnings call.

Trump responded on Saturday, posting to Truth Social that ìBetween Walmart and China they should, as is said ëEAT THE TARIFFS,í and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. Iíll be watching, and so will your customers!î

Trumpís comments echoed Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnickís comments Sunday on CNNís ìState of the Unionî that ìbusinesses and the countries primarily eat the tariff.î Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers has called such theories ìludicrous.î

Economists have told CNN that the tariffs will burden lower- and middle-income Americans, who have historically been Walmartís primary customer base. And consumers often go to the retail giant for non-negotiable purchases, such as groceries.

ìWe have always worked to keep our prices as low as possible and we wonít stop. Weíll keep prices as low as we can for as long as we can given the reality of small retail margins,î Walmart told CNN in a statement Saturday.

Price changes at Walmart will likely take effect by the end of May and prices will increase ìmuch moreî in June, the companyís finance chief, John David Rainey, told CNBC.

Walmart, which has over 4,600 stores in the United States, gets merchandise from Canada, China, India, Mexico and Vietnam, among other nations. Those countries face at least 10% in tariffs, and imports of steel, aluminum, cars and auto parts face 25% tariffs.

ìAll of the tariffs create cost pressure for us, but the larger tariffs on China have the biggest impact,î McMillon said.

Trump increased tariffs on most Chinese goods to a whopping 145%, but that rate dropped to 30% on Monday as part of a 90-day truce with China. But Trump said the tariffs could become ìsubstantially higherî if a trade agreement with China is not reached.

Other countries are negotiating with the United States amid a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs. Baseline tariffs will not go lower than 10% during negotiations, Lutnick told CNN on Sunday.

Trumpís trade war has sunk consumer sentiment in recent months. The University of Michigan reported that consumer sentiment fell 2.7% between April and May ó a near-record low, in part due to Americans fearing a recession.

Hereís what is expected to get more expensive at Walmart.

Food
ìFood inflation is very much on our mind,î McMillon said.

Bananas, avocados and coffee are among some of the groceries that McMillon said come from Colombia, Costa Rica and Peru. America also imports beets, cabbage, melons, and pineapples from Costa Rica. Sweet potatoes and citrus are imported from Peru.

Walmart did not say how much prices could increase on fruits and vegetables.

ìWeíll do our best to control what we can control in order to keep food prices as low as possible,î McMillon said, suggesting that ìcontrolling the amount of fresh food wasteî could help.

Between February and April, the average price of bananas per pound has increased by about 2 cents at US retailers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Seasonal products
Ryan Monarch, assistant professor of economics at Syracuse University, told CNN that seasonal and holiday shopping purchases canít be delayed for two to three months to wait on the trade war to play out.

Walmart is currently focused on back-to-school shopping, according to McMillon. He explained that tariffs are paid as soon as a product enters the country through customs, meaning the higher tariffs are already affecting shipments.

ìSo I think what weíre looking at is upward pressure that began in April and plays through the entire year on things that are imported,î McMillon said.

Estimating tariff costs and order quantities could ìget more challengingî further down the line when making ìdecisions related to things like Halloween and Christmas,î he said.

Toys, electronics and baby gear
ìChina, in particular, represents a lot of volume in certain categories like electronics and toys,î McMillon said.

Roughly 80% of toys sold in the United States are made in China, according to the Toy Association, an industry group.

Toy companies, like Hasbro, the owner of Nerf and Play-doh, said some items will be cut from its portfolio, and Barbie creator Mattel has issued warnings about potential price hikes due to tariffs.

ìWell, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know? And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally,î Trump said earlier this month, acknowledging the potential impact tariffs will have on toys.

There has already been a jump in the price of toys. Product pricing analysis from research firm Telsey Advisory Groups showed that the price of a Barbie doll with a swimsuit sold at Walmartís competitor Target rose 42.9% over a week in mid-April to $14.99.

Gaming products should also see big price hikes. Initially priced at $450, Nintendoís Switch 2 could instead cost around $600, according to experts.

Even an Apple iPhone 17 could cost more than $1,000 instead of $799, according to Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at investment firm Synovus.

Childcare products, such as strollers, clothes, car seats and formula, could also see a price hike. Industry experts estimate that about 90% of childrenís and baby gear products are manufactured exclusively in China, and that wonít change anytime soon.

ìCustomers need those things. Even if they were to raise prices on those products, customers are still going to buy them,î Syracuse Universityís Monarch said. ìSo you might expect products like that to see prices increasing pretty quickly.î

Home goods
In 2024, China sent more than $438 billion worth of goods into American homes. Nearly 19% of that total was machinery and mechanical appliances, according to data from the US International Trade Commission. Meanwhile, 4% of last yearís imports from China were bedding, furniture and lighting.

Rainey, Walmartís CFO, said general merchandise sales in the United States declined slightly during the first quarter, ìwith softness in electronics, home products and sporting goods.î Because home goods are not considered necessities like groceries and baby gear, consumers are more likely to hold off on buying them.

ìConsumers are very worried, and what theyíre doing is theyíre delaying their purchases of durable goods ó things like cars, things like appliances,î said Monarch.

Monarch added that Walmart was among companies to increase imports before tariffs took effect, allowing them to stock up on products that wonít perish.

This gremlin-looking toy from China is proving to be tariff-proof,"Naomi Linís favorite high-end accessory is wildly popular, an acquired taste, and shockingly resilient in the face of a tariff onslaught.

No, itís not Manolos or the latest offering from Prada ó itís a gremlin-like plush.

Itís a Labubu, a palm-sized Nordic elf with bright eyes, sharp teeth and puckish grin. Lin, a medical student in Nebraska, owns dozens ó and the one attached to her Chanel bag is dressed to the nines in a tweed outfit, matching headband and a mini ìChanelî purse.

And Lin isnít the only one captivated by Labubusí ugly charm.

Labubus are cute in the sense that theyíre soft, miniature and come in a range of costumes youíd dress your baby in ó a jack-o-lantern for Halloween, or a tiny pair of denim overalls. But they have glowering eyes and a jagged, sharp-toothed smile from ear to ear, an unblinking stare that would terrify anyone who caught its gaze in the middle of the night

The impish yet cute plushies are a global sensation among Gen Z and even those older, often hanging on handbags, backpacks and belt loops. People are flocking to shopping malls and waiting hours to purchase Labubus and their fellow creatures, who first appeared in ìThe Monstersî storybooks in 2015, in mystery ìblind boxes,î meaning the buyer doesnít know which one theyíre getting in a given collection.

The plushiesí distributor, China-based toy company Pop Mart, is enjoying meteoric growth both in the mainland and abroad in the US: In 2024, Labubus generated 3 billion yuan ($410 million) of Pop Martís 13.04 billion yuan ($1.8 billion) in revenue. Labubus and other figurines distributed by the company have so far proven resistant to the tepid consumer sentiment in the US and the chaotic trade war between Washington and Beijing ó and that growth hasnít slowed.

But itís not just the size of the companyís sales, itís their growth rate thatís more impressive. Pop Martís revenue outside China skyrocketed 375.2% to 5.07 billion yuan ($703 million) in 2024, and Citigroup research estimated Pop Martís revenue in America grew between 895% to 900% last year. Offline, Pop Martís brick-and-mortar stores from Los Angeles to Paris to Bangkok have infamously long lines, especially when new products are released.

The growth is also fueled by a plethora of other figurines ó thereís Baby Molly, Crybaby, Dimoo, Pucky and at least 30 more on the companyís US website.

If youíre lucky enough to snag a Labubu, they can cost up to $85. Resellers on StockX are upcharging into the hundreds of dollars.

And their fans are willing to splurge. Lin shelled out hundreds and spent hours on a TikTok Live to secure a Zimomo, a 22-inch creature with a spiked tail.

ìItís in high demand, so it would be on par with a luxury item,î Lin said.

Where does the obsession come from?
Lin is not the only member of her family who is Pop Mart-obsessed. Her father, who bought Lin and her sister their first Labubus while visiting Taiwan, has a Crybaby plush on his suitcase.

The meteoric growth of Pop Mart speaks to a larger history of Americans being attached to cute things from Asia (remember Hello Kitty?), Anne Cheng, an English professor at Princeton University, told CNN. Despite the push toward US-made products and the proliferation of anti-Asian sentiment during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, the growth trajectory for these toys just keeps going.

Cheng said thereís always been hypocrisy in the US, where Asian people have faced bigoted stereotypes, but when the products they make ìcome in little boxable, consumable small bits, then theyíre accessible.î

The little gremlins, baby and creature keychains also offer a glimpse into luxury that is more attainable for most consumers. Celebrities have played a big role in making them a status symbol. K-pop megastar Lisa told Vanity Fair she got into blind boxes in early 2024 and ìspent all my moneyî while jet-setting to different Pop Mart locations around the world. Oh, and Rihanna has a Labubu too.

Some Labubu collections are certainly reminiscent of past crazes. But compared to luxurious collectibles, like say, designer bags or watches, toys that cost an average of $20 to $40 are not as expensive, and in uncertain times, people are looking for affordable indulgences.

People are ìlooking for a fix and looking for anything to bring them joy,î said Ali Domrongchai, a food editor in New York City who just received her first Labubu as a gift this past year.

Blind boxes are nothing new. The idea of buying something without knowing precisely what the package contains has driven many a craze, from baseball cards to video games. And the toy collective fanatics echo the Beanie Baby mania of the í90s, or what it felt like checking which McDonaldís Happy Meal you got.

Consumers who spoke to CNN all compared the immediate joy of opening a blind box to the high of gambling. China was so concerned about addiction that in 2023, it introduced strict regulation banning the sale of mystery boxes to children under 8 years old and requiring guardian consent for children who are older.

ìIt plays into your desire for collecting things, then you keep buying them,î Cheng said.

Are Labubus recession-proof?
Pop Mart, like the majority of the toy industry, will almost certainly be impacted by President Donald Trumpís trade war with China. The US and China reached a 90-day truce this month, when the US lowered its 145% tariffs on most Chinese imports to 30%, and China reduced its 125% retaliatory tariffs to 10%.

On its FAQ page, Pop Mart said that it will cover tariff-induced costs and that ìcustomers will not be required to pay any additional customs fees.î But its latest release in April, a tie-dyed line of pastel-colored Labubus, cost $27.99 ñ $6 more than the previous one.

CNN has reached out to Pop Mart for more details on how it plans to cover those tariff fees.

Citigroup said it expects the company to accelerate diversifying its supply chain and raise prices in the US market, or prioritize expanding in other countries. In the meantime, Pop Martís stock, listed in Hong Kong, has been outperforming Tencent and Alibaba since the year began.

Where thereís a trend, thereís a dupe
For those who canít get their hands on a real Labubu, there are knock-offs ó often called lafufus or fauxbubus ó but theyíll often have lower-quality fur or a slightly misshapen smile.

And blind boxes arenít exclusive to Pop Mart. Cute, kitschy items are a staple of East Asian culture, and Asian discount stores like Miniso and Daiso, which combined have hundreds of locations in the US, sell highly coveted blind box toys for under $5. And the bigger the market gets, the more likely it is that competitors will arise in China, the Citigroup analysts warned.

And Linís Labubu, for the record, is not decked out in real Chanel. The toyís outfit is from AliExpress, a source of cheap accessories for many Labubu fans.

Domrongchai, the food editor in New York City, has been tuned into the hype: Her octogenarian great aunts have Labubus attached to their Louis Vuitton purses. And on a trip to visit family in Thailand last year, she visited ìalmost every mall in Bangkokî with her younger cousin to scour for the famous plush.

But it was nowhere to be found, and $40 dollars for a toy is ìan ungodly amountî for Thailand.

Even for those who have managed to avoid the pull of the devilish smirk of a Labubu, thereís always a growing fan base attempting to turn them to the dark side.

When a CNN reporter, a self proclaimed Sanrio and Miffy fan, confessed she found the monsters more unsettling than cute, Domrongchai was quick to encourage her: ìTheyíre not that scary. Theyíre silly guys. Look, you need to spend some time with them.î",17-May-25,Business,Alicia Wallace,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/17/business/labubu-doll-china-tariffs,,,,,,,,,,,,naomi lin‚Äôs favorite highend

The United States just lost its last perfect credit rating,"Moodyís Ratings downgraded the United Statesí debt on Friday, stripping the country of its last perfect credit rating. The move could rattle financial markets and push up interest rates, potentially creating an additional financial burden for Americans already struggling with tariffs and inflation.

Of the three major credit rating agencies, Moodyís was the lone holdout, maintaining its outstanding rating of AAA for US debt. Moodyís held a perfect credit rating for the United States since 1917.

It now ranks US creditworthiness one notch below that, at Aa1, joining Fitch Ratings and S&P, which lowered their credit ratings for US debt in 2023 and 2011, respectively.

The decision to downgrade debt was influenced by ìthe increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,î Moodyís said in a statement. Moving forward, Moodyís said it expects borrowing needs to continue to grow and for it to weigh on the US economy as a whole.

ìThe Trump administration and Republicans are focused on fixing Bidenís mess by slashing the waste, fraud, and abuse in government and passing The One, Big, Beautiful Bill to get our house back in order,î White House spokesperson Kush Desai said on Friday. ìIf Moodyís had any credibility, they would not have stayed silent as the fiscal disaster of the past four years unfolded.î

A spokesperson for the Treasury Department did not immediately respond to CNN.

Moodyís initially put the United States on notice for a potential downgrade in November, at the time citing recent events that exemplified Americaís extraordinary political divide. That included Americaís near-default last summer and the resulting ouster of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, the first time in history a speaker was given the boot during a legislative session, and Congressí inability to cement a replacement for weeks.

Stable outlook ó for now, at least
Moodyís said the US is is no immediate danger of being downgraded again: The credit-rating agency considers the US outlook ìstableî in part because of ìits long history of very effective monetary policy led by an independent Federal Reserve.î President Donald Trump, however, has recently raised questions of whether heíd continue to respect the central bankís independence, and has previously threatened to fire Chair Jerome Powell.

Aa1 is still quite strong, despite its notch below perfect. The ratings agency noted that Americaís system of governance, albeit challenged, gives Moodyís confidence that the United States still deserves a near-perfect, if not AAA, credit rating.

ìThe stable outlook also takes into account institutional features, including the constitutional separation of powers among the three branches of government that contributes to policy effectiveness over time and is relatively insensitive to events over a short period. While these institutional arrangements can be tested at times, we expect them to remain strong and resilient,î Moodyís said.

The credit-rating agency said that increasing government revenue or reducing spending could restore Americaís AAA rating. Trump has taken aim at the latter through the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, resulting in thousands of federal government workers being laid off and the gutting of the US Agency for International Development (USAID).

However, itís unclear that such moves are changing the governmentís borrowing needs. Already, the country is approaching a summer deadline for when the US could default on its debt unless the borrowing limit is raised, according to Treasury Department estimates.

At the same time, Trump is pushing Congress to pass his ìOne Big Beautiful Bill Act.î

The package would cut taxes deeply ñ essentially making permanent the sweeping individual income tax provisions of Trumpís 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as adding several temporary tax breaks to fulfill the presidentís campaign promises.

It also calls for historic cuts to the nationís safety net ñ particularly Medicaid and food stamps ñ in an effort to cut spending.

But the tax revenue loss would still swamp the spending reductions. The package would add $3.3 trillion to the nationís debt over the next decade, according to a preliminary estimate from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

Annual deficits would jump from $1.8 trillion in 2024 to $2.9 trillion by 2034 as the federal government would continue to spend more than it would raise in revenue, the committee projected.

Why America lost its AAA rating
Ballooning deficits, the unique US debt ceiling mechanism and political intransigence have been at the center of its downgrades from all three major credit ratings agencies.

In 2011, S&P cited ìpolitical brinksmanshipî and ìAmericaís governance and policymaking becoming less stable, less effective, and less predictable.î In 2023, Fitch warned of the United Statesí ìfiscal deterioration,î its ìhigh and growing general government debt burden, and the erosion of governance.î

America was running a $1.3 trillion annual budget deficit in 2011, a number that has since risen to $1.8 trillion last year.

Still, the Obama and Biden administrations lambasted both of those decisions. In 2023, Yellen said the decision was ìarbitrary and based on outdated data.î

What another downgrade could mean for Americans
US debt has long been considered by investors as the safest of safe havens, but Moodyís downgrade, along with Fitchís and S&Pís suggests it has lost some of its luster.

A downgrade would likely cause US Treasury yields to rise as investors see more risk in lending money to the government.

US Treasuries ñ and particularly the 10-year US Treasury ñ influence all kinds of debt, from the mortgage rate for the houses Americans buy to contracts written around the world

A rogue employee was behind Groks unprompted white genocide mentions,"Elon Muskís artificial intelligence company on Friday said a ìrogue employeeî was behind its chatbotís unsolicited rants about ìwhite genocideî in South Africa earlier this week.

The clarification comes less than 48 hours after Grok ó the chatbot from Muskís xAI that is available through his social media platform, X ó began bombarding users with unfounded genocidal theories in response to queries about completely off-topic subjects.

In an X post, the company said the ìunauthorized modificationî in the extremely early morning hours Pacific time pushed the AI-imbued chatbot to ìprovide a specific response on a political topicî that violates xAIís policies. The company did not identify the employee.

ìWe have conducted a thorough investigation and are implementing measures to enhance Grokís transparency and reliability,î the company said in the post.

To do so, xAI says it will openly publish Grokís system prompts on GitHub to ensure more transparency. Additionally, the company says it will install ìchecks and measuresî to make sure xAI employees canít alter prompts without preliminary review. And the AI company will also have a monitoring team in place 24/7 to address issues that arenít tackled by the automated systems.

Nicolas Miailhe, co-founder and chief executive of PRISM Eval ó an AI testing and evaluation start-up ó told CNN that Xís proposed remedy is a mixed bag.îMore transparency is generally better on this given the nature of the bot and platform (media),î Miailhe said. ìThough detailed info about the system prompting can also be used by malicious actors to craft prompt injection attacks.î

Musk, who owns xAI and currently serves as a top White House adviser, was born and raised in South Africa and has a history of arguing that a ìwhite genocideî was committed in the nation. The billionaire media mogul has also claimed that white farmers in the country are being discriminated against under land reform policies that the South African government says are aimed at combating apartheid fallout.

Less than a week ago, the Trump administration allowed 59 white South Africans to enter the US as refugees, claiming theyíd been discriminated against, while simultaneously also suspending all other refugee resettlement.

Per a Grok response to xAIís own post, the ìwhite genocideî responses occurred after a ìrogue employee at xAI tweaked my prompts without permission on May 14,î allowing the AI chatbot to ìspit out a canned political response that went against xAIís values.î

Notably, the chatbot declined to take ownership over its actions, saying, ìI didnít do anything ó I was just following the script I was given, like a good AI!î While itís true that chatbotsí responses are predicated on approved text responses anchored to their code, the dismissive admission emphasizes the danger of AI, both in terms of disseminating harmful information but also in playing down its part in such incidents.

When CNN asked Grok why it had shared answers about ìwhite genocide,î the AI chatbot again pointed to the rogue employee, adding that ìmy responses may have been influenced by recent discussions on X or data I was trained on, but I should have stayed on topic.î

Over two years have passed since OpenAIís ChatGPT made its splashy debut, opening the floodgates on commercially available AI chatbots. Since then, a litany of other AI chatbots ó including Googleís Gemini, Anthropicís Claude, Perplexity, Mistralís Le Chat, and DeepSeek ó have become available to US adults.

A recent Gallup poll shows that most Americans are using multiple AI-enabled products weekly, regardless of whether theyíre aware of the fact. But another recent study, this one from the Pew Research Center, shows that only ìone-third of U.S. adults say they have ever used an AI chatbot,î while 59% of US adults donít think they have much control over AI in their lives.

CNN asked xAI whether the ìrogue employeeî has been suspended or terminated, as well as whether the company plans to reveal the employeeís identity. The company did not respond at the time of publication.",16-May-25,Business,Nathaniel Meyersohn,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/16/business/a-rogue-employee-was-behind-groks-unprompted-white-genocide-mentions,,,,,,,,,,,,elon musk‚Äôs artificial intelligence company friday said ‚Äúrogue employee‚Äù behind chatbot‚Äôs unsolicited rants ‚Äúwhite genocide‚Äù south africa earlier week clarification comes less hours grok ‚Äî chatbot musk‚Äôs xai available social media platform x ‚Äî began bombarding users unfounded genocidal theories response queries completely offtopic subjects x post company said ‚Äúunauthorized modification‚Äù extremely early morning hours pacific time pushed aiimbued chatbot ‚Äúprovide specific response political topic‚Äù violates xai‚Äôs policies company identify employee ‚Äúwe conducted thorough investigation implementing measures enhance grok‚Äôs transparency reliability‚Äù company said post xai says openly publish grok‚Äôs system prompts github ensure transparency additionally company says install ‚Äúchecks measures‚Äù make sure xai employees can‚Äôt alter prompts without preliminary review ai company also monitoring team place address issues aren‚Äôt tackled automated systems nicolas miailhe cofounder chief executive prism eval ‚Äî ai testing evaluation startup ‚Äî told cnn x‚Äôs proposed remedy mixed bag‚Äùmore transparency generally better given nature bot platform media‚Äù miailhe said ‚Äúthough detailed info system prompting can also used malicious actors craft prompt injection attacks‚Äù musk owns xai currently serves top white house adviser born raised south africa history arguing ‚Äúwhite genocide‚Äù committed nation billionaire media mogul also claimed white farmers country discriminated land reform policies south african government says aimed combating apartheid fallout less week ago trump administration allowed white south africans enter us refugees claiming they‚Äôd discriminated simultaneously also suspending refugee resettlement per grok response xai‚Äôs post ‚Äúwhite genocide‚Äù responses occurred ‚Äúrogue employee xai tweaked prompts without permission may ‚Äù allowing ai chatbot ‚Äúspit canned political response went xai‚Äôs values‚Äù notably chatbot declined take ownership actions saying ‚Äúi didn‚Äôt anything ‚Äî just following script given like good ai‚Äù it‚Äôs true chatbots‚Äô responses predicated approved text responses anchored code dismissive admission emphasizes danger ai terms disseminating harmful information also playing part incidents cnn asked grok shared answers ‚Äúwhite genocide‚Äù ai chatbot pointed rogue employee adding ‚Äúmy responses may influenced recent discussions x data trained stayed topic‚Äù two years passed since openai‚Äôs chatgpt made splashy debut opening floodgates commercially available ai chatbots since litany ai chatbots ‚Äî including google‚Äôs gemini anthropic‚Äôs claude perplexity mistral‚Äôs le chat deepseek ‚Äî become available us adults recent gallup poll shows americans using multiple aienabled products weekly regardless whether they‚Äôre aware fact another recent study one pew research center shows ‚Äúonethird us adults say ever used ai chatbot‚Äù us adults don‚Äôt think much control ai lives cnn asked xai whether ‚Äúrogue employee‚Äù suspended terminated well whether company plans reveal employee‚Äôs identity company respond time publication

"Boeing crash victimsÄfamilies say Justice Department set to drop criminal case, decry decision as morally repugnant","The US Department of Justice is set to drop a criminal case against aircraft maker Boeing despite the fact that the company agreed to plead guilty last year, according to attorneys for families of victims of two fatal crashes of the 737 Max that led to the case.

The victimsí attorneys say they were notified by Justice Department officials Friday morning that it is looking at dropping the case and will instead reach a non-criminal settlement with the company. The new settlement will include an additional $444.5 million into a crash victimsí fund that would be divided evenly per crash victim.

The attorneys said the family members are outraged by the decision and that they will object to the decision in court.

ìThis is morally repugnant. It is a slap on the wrist. And it feels like a bribe,î said Sanjiv Singh, an attorney who represents 16 victims in the 2018 crash of a Lion Air Boeing 737 Max.

The Justice Department and Boeing declined to comment on the statement from the victimsí families.

The familiesí attorneys said they were informed this morning that Boeing now no longer is agreeing to plead guilty, and would take its chances at a trial, and that is the reason that the Justice Department is considering no longer pursuing the criminal charges. But Robert Clifford, an attorney for families in the Ethiopian crash, said the is no ìlitigation riskî as now being claimed by the Justice Department, given the uncontested evidence against Boeing.

The Lion Air crash and a crash of an Ethiopian Airlines flight in March 2019 killed a total of 346 people, and led to fraud charges against Boeing alleging that it deceived the Federal Aviation Administration during the initial certification process for the Max jets.

The decision to drop the case against Boeing is another sign that the Trump administration could go easier on prosecution of corporate misdeeds than had been the case under the Biden administration.

In the final days of the first Trump administration, Boeing agreed to a ìdeferred prosecutionî settlement on the same charges that could have relieved it of ever facing criminal prosecution. But in January 2024, days before a three-year probationary period on that original agreement ended, a door plug blew out of the side of a 737 Max flown by Alaska Air.

While no one was killed in that incident, it opened the door for the Justice Department to again resume prosecution of the company.

Six months later, Boeing agreed to the guilty plea.

The original guilty plea reached in July included $487 million in fines ó a fraction of the $24.8 billion that families of crash victims wanted the aircraft maker to pay. It also stipulated that Boeing would have to operate under the oversight of an independent monitor ñ a person to be chosen by the government ñ for a period of three years.

The victims families objected to that guilty plea, arguing it let the company off too lightly for its misdeeds. In December Reed OíConnor, the federal judge hearing the case, rejected the guilty plea, not because it was too lenient, or too harsh, but because he had problems with how the independent monitor would be selected.

ìIt is fair to say the governmentís attempt to ensure compliance has failed,î OíConnor wrote in his opinion. ìAt this point, the public interest requires the court to step in. Marginalizing the court in the selection and monitoring of the independent monitor as the plea agreement does undermines public confidence in Boeingís probation.î

The attorneys for the families cheered OíConnorís decision in December to reject the plea, and they say they will turn to him again if the Justice Department moves to drop the criminal case against Boeing.

ìYou have all the facts you need to prosecute this case,î Clifford said in a statement. ìThese families are willing to take the risks that their government apparently is unwilling to take to hold these criminals responsible. We are offended by this deal, and we will challenge this.î",16-May-25,Business,Liam Reilly,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/16/business/boeing-justice-drop-criminal-case-morally-repugnant,,,,,,,,,,,,us department justice set drop criminal case aircraft maker boeing despite fact company agreed plead guilty last year according attorneys families victims two fatal crashes max led case victims‚Äô attorneys say notified justice department officials friday morning looking dropping case instead reach noncriminal settlement company new settlement include additional million crash victims‚Äô fund divided evenly per crash victim attorneys said family members outraged decision object decision court ‚Äúthis morally repugnant slap wrist feels like bribe‚Äù said sanjiv singh attorney represents victims crash lion air boeing max justice department boeing declined comment statement victims‚Äô families families‚Äô attorneys said informed morning boeing now longer agreeing plead guilty take chances trial reason justice department considering longer pursuing criminal charges robert clifford attorney families ethiopian crash said ‚Äúlitigation risk‚Äù now claimed justice department given uncontested evidence boeing lion air crash crash ethiopian airlines flight march killed total people led fraud charges boeing alleging deceived federal aviation administration initial certification process max jets decision drop case boeing another sign trump administration go easier prosecution corporate misdeeds case biden administration final days first trump administration boeing agreed ‚Äúdeferred prosecution‚Äù settlement charges relieved ever facing criminal prosecution january days threeyear probationary period original agreement ended door plug blew side max flown alaska air one killed incident opened door justice department resume prosecution company six months later boeing agreed guilty plea original guilty plea reached july included million fines ‚Äî fraction billion families crash victims wanted aircraft maker pay also stipulated boeing operate oversight independent monitor ‚Äì person chosen government ‚Äì period three years victims families objected guilty plea arguing let company lightly misdeeds december reed o‚Äôconnor federal judge hearing case rejected guilty plea lenient harsh problems independent monitor selected ‚Äúit fair say government‚Äôs attempt ensure compliance failed‚Äù o‚Äôconnor wrote opinion ‚Äúat point public interest requires court step marginalizing court selection monitoring independent monitor plea agreement undermines public confidence boeing‚Äôs probation‚Äù attorneys families cheered o‚Äôconnor‚Äôs decision december reject plea say turn justice department moves drop criminal case boeing ‚Äúyou facts need prosecute case‚Äù clifford said statement ‚Äúthese families willing take risks government apparently unwilling take hold criminals responsible offended deal challenge this‚Äù
"Engineers go on strike at NJ Transit, halting the nations third-largest commuter line","
Engineers at New Jersey Transit went on strike early Friday, bringing trains on the nationís third-largest commuter rail service to a halt.

A final day of negotiations between the state-run commuter rail service and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) failed to reach an 11th hour deal to prevent a strike.

The work stoppage is poised to severely inconvenience some 100,000 daily rail commuters, businesses across the New York metropolitan area, and fans of Shakira and BeyoncÈ, who will have trouble getting to concerts the two stars have planned at a football stadium just outside of Manhattan in the coming days.

Talks between the two sides ended slightly before 10 p.m. ET Thursday, according to both the union and NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri, who appeared at a press conference late Thursday night with NJ Gov. Phil Murphy.

Kolluri told the press conference late Thursday that the two sides had been close to reaching a deal but could not reach agreement on a wages package that the state and NJ Transit management believes is affordable. He said the two sides are due to return to the negotiating table by Sunday morning, and that he is ready to return to the the table before then if the union is willing to do so.

Kolluri and Murphy both said they want an agreement that is fair to the union members, but not one where the demands of the unions would cause financial problems for the railroad.

A previous tentative labor deal had been rejected by 87% of the nearly 500 members of the union who drive the trains. While that deal would have given workers their first raise since 2019 and thousands of dollars in backpay for each union member, it still would have left members far short of the pay of engineers at Amtrak and nearby commuter railroads that use the same stations.

Commuters asked to work from home
NJ Transit officials said they had increased bus service in anticipation of the strike but admitted buses would only be able to handle an ìextremely limited numberî of commuters. The agency and Murphy urged commuters who ride its trains to make other plans or work from home, if possible. NJ Transit said commuters should limit traveling on the rest of the system to ìessentialî purposes only.

ìIf you can work from home, certainly tomorrow (Friday) Öwould be a really good day to do so,î Murphy said.

But there was relatively limited overcrowding on buses Friday morning. Murphy attributed that to Friday being the day with the least ridership on a normal basis. He expects more crowding on Monday and even more in the middle of next week if the strike continues.

Murphy said that while the engineers are a backbone of the stateís transit system, ìthe workers and families who rely on our transit system every single day are the backbone of our entire economy.î

Besides the traffic congestion that will likely clog the bridges and tunnels that span the Hudson River as a result, many commuters to Manhattan will be hit with a ìcongestion pricingî toll of up to a $9 in addition to bridge and tunnel tolls that can cost more than twice that amount.

Beyond the daily commuters traveling mostly to and from Manhattan, the strike could cause huge problems for concertgoers, especially those who had planned to reach the shows by train. Shakira is set to perform Friday night at MetLife Stadium, located in New Jersey less than 10 miles from the Lincoln Tunnel that links the state with Manhattan, and BeyoncÈ is due to perform there for a series of five shows starting next Thursday.

Concertgoers who drive to the Shakira or BeyoncÈ shows could find themselves stuck in worse-than-normal traffic as would-be train passengers are forced onto the roads.

The union has argued that its members need a significant raise to bring them in line with engineers at other passenger railroads and that members would not accept anything less.

ìWe, the locomotive engineers of NJ Transit are asking only for a fair and competitive wage,î said Thomas Haas, the general chairman of the unionís unit representing the 450 engineers at the railroad, in remarks Wednesday night before the meeting of NJ Transitís board. ìThe last thing we want to see is that (service) to be interrupted. But weíre at the end of our rope.î

The cost of ëme tooí clauses
The union says its current contract demands would cost only $4 million more per year compared to managementís previous contract offer that was rejected by members. A strike, it added, will cost the railroad more than meeting the unionís offer.

But Kolluri said that if NJ Transit agreed to BLETís demand, it would have to offer the same pay raises to other unions under ìme tooî clauses in their own labor deals. Murphy said those clauses would raise additional costs from less than $10 million a year to more than $100 million a year for the agency, and that it could not afford to pay that amount.

ìI told them I respect the offer they put on the table,î Kolluri said. ìI respect the fact that we came close to reaching a wage rate that they think theyíre entitled to. Where we could not bridge the gap is this ëme tooí clause.î

But Mark Wallace, BLETís president, told CNN that the union believes its proposal contained provisions that could have given engineers the wages they are seeking without triggering the ìme tooî clauses. He also said the union had made concessions on work rules and health insurance to make their salary demands more affordable. He said that the fact the strike started is on NJ Transit negotiators who walked away from the table.

ìI felt like we were having some positive movement, and at 9:50, they chose to walk away,î he said.

Wallace said NJ Transit could afford the unionís wage demands if it hadnít spent hundreds of millions on building and furnishing a new headquarters in recent years.

Kolluri denied that the talks broke off, only that they reached a point where a recess was in the best interest. He said at a Friday morning press conference that he told the union that both sides should step back and think about the offers on the table and then quickly resume negotiations.

On Thursday night, he said still thinks a deal can be reached soon to end the strike. ìThis is not a lost cause,î he said. ìThis is an imminently achievable deal.î

But Friday morning, Murphy blamed the union for the fact that the strike.

ìIt did not have to come to this,î the governor said. ìIt is a frankly of mess of their own making, and it is a slap in the face of every commuter and worker who relies on NJ Transit.î

BLET also said the contract rejected by members would have left their pay about 20% behind that of engineers at Amtrak and three other nearby commuter railroads: Long Island Railroad, Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority (SEPTA) and Metro North, which serves the suburbs north of New York City.

Thatís part of the reason why the union says it continues to lose members. Membership has fallen from 500 at the start of the year to 450 as members leave NJ Transit for those other railroads. And that loss of engineers is also costly, according to the union.

Quincy Dover, one of the striking engineers who has been at NJ Transit for three years, told CNN that he doesnít want to have to look at jobs at other railroads but also doesnít want an unfair contract to force him to make that decision.

ìI have to look at other options such as Metro North or Amtrak. I do want to start a family. I do want to buy a home. Is NJ Transit the place for me to do that?î he said. He said other engineers are thinking the same thing.

ìYou donít want them to train here and then go to another railroad. That doesnít make much sense,î he said.

BLET says it takes two years of training at $250,000 each to replace those who leave, while NJ Transit will be forced to cancel trains due to the lack of engineers. NJ Transit insists it has sufficient staffing to operate the railroadís full schedule.

No signs yet Congress will end the strike
Railroads operate under an arcane century-old federal law, the Railway Labor Act, that controls labor relations at railroads and airlines, greatly limiting the unionís ability to go on strike. Even when members of a union reject a contract, as has happened in this case, they can be ordered to stay on the job and accept the terms of the deal through an act of Congress.

But Congress may not feel as compelled to act in the case of a single commuter railroad. So far, there has not been any legislation introduced that would block or end a strike, so any Congressional action would take time.

BLETís Wallace told CNN that the union hopes and expects that Congress will not intervene, given that this is not a national strike.

ìI hope their stance is theyíre going to stay out of our fight,î he said on the picket line outside of New Yorkís Penn Station. ìWhen two people get in a fight on the street, you walk by it.î

In 1983, union members at New Jersey Transit were on strike for one month. Also in the 1980s, there were strikes that lasted 108 days at the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority (SEPTA), for 42 days at Metro North and 11-days at the Long Island Railroad.",16-May-25,Business,Hadas Gold,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/16/business/new-jersey-transit-rail-strike-friday-hnk-intl,,,,,,,,,,,,engineers new jersey transit went strike early friday

"CEO of Novo Nordisk, maker of Wegovy, is stepping down","Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, maker of blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy, said Friday its CEO was stepping down by ìmutual agreementî with the companyís board of directors, citing ìrecent market challengesî and a steep decline in the companyís share price.

Lars Fruergaard Jorgensenís departure comes a week after the company downgraded its sales and profits forecast and follows a more than 50% decline in the companyís shares since mid-2024. Shares had skyrocketed after the introduction of Wegovy and diabetes medicine Ozempic, which are both based on the same basic ingredient, semaglutide.

At the peak, the companyís market capitalization ñ or the combined price of all its shares ñ exceeded Denmarkís annual gross domestic product and made it Europeís most valuable company, a title it has since lost to software maker SAP.

The company said May 7 that Wegovy sales in the United States had been undercut by cheaper replica drugs produced by so-called compounding pharmacies using active ingredients of patented drugs in case of shortage. The Food and Drug Administration, the US drug regulator, has said however that the shortages have eased and the replicas will have to cease in the coming months.

On Sunday a study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine showing people lost more weight using competitor drug Zepbound, made by Eli Lilly of Indianapolis. The study, the first head-to-head comparison of the two, was funded by Lilly. Novo Nordiskís (NVO) share price is down 54% from its peak in June 2024. Its US-listed shares fell another 3% in morning trading Friday.

The company, headquartered in Bagsvaerd, Denmark, praised a ìsignificant growth journey and transformationî led by Jorgensen during his eight years as CEO.

ìThe changes are, however, made in light of the recent market challenges Novo Nordisk has been facing and the development of the companyís share price since mid-2024,î the company said in a statement. The board and Jorgensen ìhave jointly concluded that initiating a CEO succession is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders.î

Two of Americas largest cable companies are merging,"
Two of the biggest cable companies in the United States have agreed to merge, marking a major milestone in consolidation as cord-cutters continue to ditch their pricey TV packages, thus forcing companies to adjust to their dwindling futures.

Charter Communications, which operates under the Spectrum branding, is combining with its privately held rival Cox Communications, which it values at $34.5 billion including debt, the two companies announced Friday.

Combining helps both of the companies on several fronts. The first is growing competition from AT&T, T-Mobile and other wireless providers, which are poaching customers with their own broadband services and packaging them with wireless plans. Plus, people are ditching their pay-TV packages for cheaper streaming options and further chipping away at the cable companiesí once-lucrative bottom lines.

A combined entity will help both companies compete against wireless services and improve their offerings.

ìThis combination will augment our ability to innovate and provide high-quality, competitively priced products, delivered with outstanding customer service, to millions of homes and businesses,î said Charter CEO Chris Winfrey in a statement.

Charterís (CHTR) stock jumped more than 6% on the news and is one of the few cable companies to have a decent year, rising about 22% since January. The company keeps adding more mobile users, making up for their losses in cable subscribers.

Cox is the largest division of Cox Enterprises, which is a family-owned firm founded in 1898 and has stakes in cable, automotive and media companies. The combined company will be called Cox Communications, but Spectrum will be the consumer-facing name.

The headquarters will be located at Charterís offices in Stamford, Connecticut, with a ìsignificant presenceî at Coxís campus in Atlanta.

The transaction is contingent on regulatory approval and could be a litmus test for President Donald Trumpís views on major companies combining.",16-May-25,Business,Ramishah Maruf,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/16/business/cox-charter-cable-merger,,,,,,,,,,,,two biggest cable companies united states agreed merge marking major milestone consolidation cordcutters continue ditch pricey tv packages thus forcing companies adjust dwindling futures charter communications operates spectrum branding combining privately held rival cox communications values billion including debt two companies announced friday combining helps companies several fronts first growing competition att tmobile wireless providers poaching customers broadband services packaging wireless plans plus people ditching paytv packages cheaper streaming options chipping away cable companies‚Äô oncelucrative bottom lines combined entity help companies compete wireless services improve offerings ‚Äúthis combination augment ability innovate provide highquality competitively priced products delivered outstanding customer service millions homes businesses‚Äù said charter ceo chris winfrey statement charter‚Äôs chtr stock jumped news one cable companies decent year rising since january company keeps adding mobile users making losses cable subscribers cox largest division cox enterprises familyowned firm founded stakes cable automotive media companies combined company called cox communications spectrum consumerfacing name headquarters located charter‚Äôs offices stamford connecticut ‚Äúsignificant presence‚Äù cox‚Äôs campus atlanta transaction contingent regulatory approval litmus test president donald trump‚Äôs views major companies combining
Trump says the clock is ticking for 150 countries to make a deal or face higher tariffs,"If you thought President Donald Trumpís trade war was over, he has some news for you: Tariffs are going up again.

At the conclusion of his Middle East trip Friday, Trump acknowledged that trade negotiations are progressing too slowly to accommodate every country that wants to strike a new trade deal with the United States. So Trump said heíd give other countries a few more weeks, and then Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick would simply tell Americaís trading partners what their new tariffs are.

ìWe have, at the same time, 150 countries that want to make a deal, but youíre not able to see that many countries,î Trump said during a business roundtable in Abu Dhabi Friday. ìSo at a certain point, over the next two to three weeks, I think Scott and Howard will be sending letters out, essentially telling people ñ weíll be very fair ñ but weíll be telling people what theyíll be paying to do business in the United States.î

Trump on April 9 paused his massive so-called reciprocal tariffs, which he announced on what he called ìLiberation Dayî on April 2. The reprieve was supposed to be for 90 days, to allow countries to negotiate with the administration. Trump officials have said around 100 countries have offered to negotiate deals, setting a tremendously difficult task before US trade negotiators to race against the clock to make new commitments.

Without those negotiated deals, Trump could impose reciprocal tariffs ñ some of which are as high as 50%. The tariffs arenít technically reciprocal, and many smaller countries with large trade gaps with the United States would end up with significant tariff burdens.

ìI guess you could say they could appeal it, but for the most part I think weíre going to be very fair, but itís not possible to meet the number of people that want to see us,î Trump said.

Trump has floated a similar idea before, albeit on a timeframe that has since elapsed.

On April 23, in the Oval Office, Trump said his administration would ìset the tariffî for countries that fail to negotiate new terms in the following few weeks.

ìIn the end, I think whatís going to happen is weíre going to have great deals, and by the way, if we donít have a deal with a company or a country, weíre going to set the tariff,î Trump said last month. ìIíd say over the next couple of weeks, wouldnít you say? I think so. Over the next two, three weeks. Weíll be setting the number.î

So far, the Trump administration has managed to announce two new frameworks for trade negotiations that resulted in lower tariffs or lower trade barriers with other countries. The first was with the United Kingdom, announced earlier this month, and the second was with China, which Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer negotiated in Geneva last weekend.

Trumpís negotiators have said they are in active discussions with a dozen or so countries, and Trump has said he is close to announcing several more agreements. The administration has previously said India and Japan are getting close to a framework of a deal, as is South Korea, although a new government is coming in there, which will delay negotiations.

The new tariffs
Itís not clear what new tariffs Trump will set on countries that are unable to strike a deal with the United States in the coming weeks ñ and whether those new tariffs will permanently supersede the paused reciprocal tariffs or merely serve as an interim tariff while negotiations continue. In the meantime, the United States maintains a 10% universal tariff on virtually every good imported to America, plus higher rates for certain products.

Although Lutnick and some other administration officials have described the 10% tariff as a ìbaseline,î Trump earlier this month rejected that notion, suggesting that US importers would pay a tariff of more than 10% to bring in goods from most countries.

After announcing the framework for trade negotiations with the UK, Trump said other countries wouldnít get such a good deal. Unlike the UK, whose tariff was set at 10%, other countries will pay a higher rate, Trump said.

That means tariffs will go higher than where they are today: according to Fitch Ratings, even with the 90-day reciprocal tariff pause, set to expire July 8, the United States maintains a 13% average tariff rate on imported goods. Although thatís lower than the 23% in effect last week, before the Trump administration agreed to lower tariffs on Chinese goods, itís way higher than the 2.3% average tariff rate from before Trump took office for the second time.

They could go much higher: Trump last month said heíd declare ìtotal victoryî if import taxes were as high as 50% a year from now.

Trumpís back-and-forth stance on tariffs has caused incredible uncertainty for businesses and consumers, and mainstream economists say the chances of a US recession ñ though falling as Trump has backed off many of his most aggressive trade policies ñ are roughly a coin flip. It has also rattled markets, sending stocks tumbling before they rebounded over the past several weeks as Trump has expressed openness to negotiations on trade.

Where are the deals?
Trump has previously said his administration is rapidly constructing scores of deals that could make trade with other nations fairer and bring manufacturing back to the United States.

ìYou have to understand, Iím dealing with all the companies, very friendly countries. Weíre meeting with China. Weíre doing fine with everybody. But ultimately, Iíve made all the deals,î Trump said in a Time interview last month. ìIíve made 200 deals.î

Trump said in the interview, conducted in late April, that he would announce those deals ìover the next three to four weeks.î That same week, Trump said heíd announce those deals in two to three weeksí time.

Despite Trump and his administrationís rhetoric, actual trade deals take a lot of time ñ often years ñ to hash out. They typically involve incredibly complex agreements, delving into the minutiae of various goods and nontariff barriers. They often involve significant political considerations, as various parties seek to protect voters with special interests.

So Trumpís concession Friday that hundreds or even dozens of deals arenít possible on such a short timeframe shows the limitations of threatening tariffs in order to achieve rapid concessions from trading partners with their own vested interests. In the meantime, Americans will be paying more for goods that arenít made in the United States.",16-May-25,Business,Jordan Valinsky,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/16/business/trade-deals-trump,,,,,,,,,,,,thought president donald trump‚Äôs trade war news tariffs going conclusion middle east trip friday trump acknowledged trade negotiations progressing slowly accommodate every country wants strike new trade deal united states trump said he‚Äôd give countries weeks treasury secretary scott bessent commerce secretary howard lutnick simply tell america‚Äôs trading partners new tariffs ‚Äúwe time countries want make deal you‚Äôre able see many countries‚Äù trump said business roundtable abu dhabi friday ‚Äúso certain point next two three weeks think scott howard sending letters essentially telling people ‚Äì we‚Äôll fair ‚Äì we‚Äôll telling people they‚Äôll paying business united states‚Äù trump april paused massive socalled reciprocal tariffs announced called ‚Äúliberation day‚Äù april reprieve supposed days allow countries negotiate administration trump officials said around countries offered negotiate deals setting tremendously difficult task us trade negotiators race clock make new commitments without negotiated deals trump impose reciprocal tariffs ‚Äì high tariffs aren‚Äôt technically reciprocal many smaller countries large trade gaps united states end significant tariff burdens ‚Äúi guess say appeal part think we‚Äôre going fair it‚Äôs possible meet number people want see us‚Äù trump said trump floated similar idea albeit timeframe since elapsed april oval office trump said administration ‚Äúset tariff‚Äù countries fail negotiate new terms following weeks ‚Äúin end think what‚Äôs going happen we‚Äôre going great deals way don‚Äôt deal company country we‚Äôre going set tariff‚Äù trump said last month ‚Äúi‚Äôd say next couple weeks wouldn‚Äôt say think next two three weeks we‚Äôll setting number‚Äù far trump administration managed announce two new frameworks trade negotiations resulted lower tariffs lower trade barriers countries first united kingdom announced earlier month second china bessent us trade representative jamieson greer negotiated geneva last weekend trump‚Äôs negotiators said active discussions dozen countries trump said close announcing several agreements administration previously said india japan getting close framework deal south korea although new government coming delay negotiations new tariffs it‚Äôs clear new tariffs trump set countries unable strike deal united states coming weeks ‚Äì whether new tariffs permanently supersede paused reciprocal tariffs merely serve interim tariff negotiations continue meantime united states maintains universal tariff virtually every good imported america plus higher rates certain products although lutnick administration officials described tariff ‚Äúbaseline‚Äù trump earlier month rejected notion suggesting us importers pay tariff bring goods countries announcing framework trade negotiations uk trump said countries wouldn‚Äôt get good deal unlike uk whose tariff set countries pay higher rate trump said means tariffs go higher today according fitch ratings even day reciprocal tariff pause set expire july united states maintains average tariff rate imported goods although that‚Äôs lower effect last week trump administration agreed lower tariffs chinese goods it‚Äôs way higher average tariff rate trump took office second time go much higher trump last month said he‚Äôd declare ‚Äútotal victory‚Äù import taxes high year now trump‚Äôs backandforth stance tariffs caused incredible uncertainty businesses consumers mainstream economists say chances us recession ‚Äì though falling trump backed many aggressive trade policies ‚Äì roughly coin flip also rattled markets sending stocks tumbling rebounded past several weeks trump expressed openness negotiations trade deals trump previously said administration rapidly constructing scores deals make trade nations fairer bring manufacturing back united states ‚Äúyou understand i‚Äôm dealing companies friendly countries we‚Äôre meeting china we‚Äôre fine everybody ultimately i‚Äôve made deals‚Äù trump said time interview last month ‚Äúi‚Äôve made deals‚Äù trump said interview conducted late april announce deals ‚Äúover next three four weeks‚Äù week trump said he‚Äôd announce deals two three weeks‚Äô time despite trump administration‚Äôs rhetoric actual trade deals take lot time ‚Äì often years ‚Äì hash typically involve incredibly complex agreements delving minutiae various goods nontariff barriers often involve significant political considerations various parties seek protect voters special interests trump‚Äôs concession friday hundreds even dozens deals aren‚Äôt possible short timeframe shows limitations threatening tariffs order achieve rapid concessions trading partners vested interests meantime americans paying goods aren‚Äôt made united states
"Rite Aid offloads pharmacy assets of 1,000 locations to several rivals","Rite Aid has sold the pharmacy services of most of its stores across the United States to several rivals.

The bankrupt company announced the fire sale Thursday, with CVS Pharmacy, Walgreens, Albertsons and Kroger scooping up Rite Aidís pharmacy services at more than 1,000 locations.

ìThese agreements ensure our pharmacy customers will experience a smooth transition while preserving jobs for some of our valued team members,î Rite Aid CEO Matt Schroeder said in a statement, adding that the move ensures its customers will ìreceive the pharmacy services and care they require without interruption.î

CVS Pharmacy was the biggest buyer, snapping up the prescription files of more than 600 Rite Aid stores spanning 15 states and agreeing to buy 64 Rite Aid locations in Idaho, Oregon and Washington. The transactions still have to be approved by the relevant bankruptcy court.

As Rite Aid navigates the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process, the company said its stores remain open and customers can continue to use their pharmacy services ìwithout interruption.î

Earlier this month, Rite Aid filed for bankruptcy for the second time, just seven months after the chain exited the previous Chapter 11 bankruptcy and emerged as a private company.

Rite Aid first filed for bankruptcy in October 2023, becoming a casualty of a miserable environment for drug stores, exacerbated by its runner-up status to bigger chains and expensive legal battles for allegedly filling unlawful opioid prescriptions, which pushed its debt to nearly $4 billion.

The company is a distant third-largest nationwide standalone pharmacy chain in the US and the seventh-largest pharmacy overall when taking into account big box chains. It has about 1,240 stores remaining ó roughly half of the number it had just two years ago.

Theres no denying it now: Tariffs are raising prices,"Donald Trumpís pitch to Americans on the campaign trail last year included a simple (and simplistic) promise: lower prices on Day One. Even if he didnít mean it literally, itís now Day 115, and the results of his only significant economic policy show that the opposite is happening.

Thursday brought an avalanche of data that all point to one outcome: Prices are going up. Just ask Walmart.

If thereís one company in the world that could theoretically take tariffs on the chin, itís the worldís biggest retailer, which can (and does) use its scale to pressure suppliers to keep prices low for shoppers. But Walmart said Thursday that US tariffs ó as a reminder: those are taxes that American businesses pay on imported goods ó are too high, and it is raising prices in response.

ìGiven the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we arenít able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins,î Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said Thursday on an earnings call. ìThe higher tariffs will result in higher prices.î

Walmart has no political incentive to do this ó in fact, itís taking a risk by so publicly tying its price hikes to tariffs, something that Amazon and Mattel learned the hard way tends to enrage the president. And this is not a story of corporate greed run amok, because Walmart would be foolish to try to gouge its customers at a time when economic anxiety is high (more on that in a moment).

This is just what happens when a government puts 10% baseline tariffs on all imports. The money has to come from someoneís pocket, and that someone is generally the company importing the things or the consumer buying the things, or both.

You may be thinking, ìWhatever, I went to Walmart/Target/Home Depot this week and everything was fine.î And thatís probably true, because retailers across the board stockpiled as much as they could to get ahead of Trumpís April 2 tariff rollout. But as those inventories wind down, the more-expensive goods ordered after April 2 will hit the shelves. (For Walmart, thatís expected to happen next month.)

Another reason consumers have been insulated: Businesses are already absorbing the costs, according to the latest gauge of US wholesale inflation, known as the Producer Price Index. Last month, wholesale prices actually fell, which sounds like a good thing until you look a little closer at why.

The dip in the PPI came from a plunge in ìtrade services,î a category that measures profit margins for wholesalers and retailers. Essentially, that means producers are letting higher input costs eat into their profit margins while they try to figure out what to do.

Consumers are in a similar boat. Like the corporations, customers saw tariffs coming and moved quickly to try to front-run them, snapping up cars, electronics and home goods in March.

Now, though, theyíre pulling back even more than economists expected. Consumer spending data for April was just barely positive year-over-year, rising 0.1%.

Together, these indicators ó Walmartís price hikes, April wholesale prices and consumer spending data ó all tell the same story: The tariff ìpainî that Trump warned about (only after taking office) is here.

These indicators are also among the first pieces of ìhard dataî to confirm that Americansí behavior is starting to match their mood. (Those things donít always align. Like when inflation was surging a few years ago, folks tended to tell pollsters that the economy was terrible, but they also continued to spend money like everything was great ó aka the vibecession.)

ìWe are beginning to see the impact of trade policy filtering into the hard data in such a way that itís impossible to deny that it is now affecting revenues and profit margins for firms,î Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, told my colleague Alicia Wallace.

But wait! Thereís more. The Silver Foxes of Finance also weighed in Thursday.

Jamie Dimon, the head of Americaís largest bank, JPMorgan Chase, told Bloomberg News in an interview that heís not counting on the US getting out of 2025 recession-free. And he even suggested Americaís longstanding status as the worldís financial safe haven is not guaranteed. (ìYou do not have a divine right to success,î the billionaire bank CEO said.)

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, meanwhile, warned that ìwe may be entering a period of more frequent, and potentially more persistent, supply shocks.î (Read: Prices are going to be a lot more volatile, up and down, making it much harder for the central bank to do its job.)

To be sure, there are some areas where prices are actually going down. Eggs, as the president is fond of noting, are getting cheaper. Ditto airfare, gas, sporting event tickets and hotel rooms. Unfortunately, those prices are coming down because demand is going slack. People donít book vacations when theyíre not confident about their income.

Bottom line: Weíre in it now, folks.

Stay tuned: Friday adds some fresh ìsoft dataî to our simmering economic stew. Consumer sentiment ó what consumers say about how they feel ó measured by the University of Michigan has been falling steadily since January. Itís possible, given the timing of the survey, that we may see a bit more optimism in response to last weekendís unexpected detente with China.

And next week, Target, Home Depot and Loweís report earnings and financial forecasts that should tell us more about how tariffs are hitting their bottom lines.

Export rushÄ grips China as businesses scramble to make the most of tariff pause,"A surprise breakthrough in US-China trade tensions has unleashed a flurry of activity across Chinese factories and ports as companies in both countries rush to make the most of a 90-day rollback of heavy tariffs announced earlier this week.

For Niki Ye, a salesperson in southern China who sources toys for sale on Amazon, a 30% spike in orders since that announcement has meant her company is staffing up to meet demand. ìAnd this is only the first week,î she said.

Liu Changhai, a sales manager at an export-oriented agency in eastern China that specializes in home furnishings, said sales now match those during a typical peak season ñ but there would be a delay in sending goods.

ìThe new orders have not been manufactured yet and are not ready for shipment,î he told CNN.

Meanwhile, ports are about to start humming as companies rush to ship out inventory that had been held back during weeks of trade tension. Bookings for shipping containers from China to the United States spiked almost 300% in the seven days ending May 13, compared to the week ending May 5, according to container-tracking software provider Vizion.

Thatís a radical shift from last month, when a rapid, tit-for-tat escalation of US-China tariffs initiated by President Donald Trump drove duties so high that trade between the two once deeply intertwined economies largely ground to a halt.

On Monday, American and Chinese trade negotiators meeting in Geneva announced both sides would reduce tariffs by 115 percentage points for an initial 90 days.

The deal, which went into effect Wednesday, brings US tariffs on Chinese imports into the country to 30%, not including pre-existing measures imposed during Trumpís first term. Chinaís duties on all US imports raised last month, meanwhile, fell from 125% on most US imports to 10% ñ though earlier tariffs on select goods also remain in place, officials said. Negotiations are expected to continue in the weeks ahead.

ìRegardless of the outcome of future negotiations, companies must seize this 90-day window,î Ge Jizhong, chairman of major customs declaration firm Shanghai Xinhai Customs Brokerage told state-backed financial outlet Securities Times earlier this week.

ìAmerican companies will rush to replenish their stocks within 90 days, and Chinese companies will also rush to ship goods and clear out their warehouse inventories.î

ëMove them back to Chinaí
Among those helping companies navigate that rush is Ben Schwall, whose China-based supply chain management firm STG Consultants helps companies with product sourcing and their China and Asia strategies. He says heís spent this week fielding queries from clients.

Some of them heard the news while in the middle of re-routing supply chains and manufacturing away from China to other Asian countries to avoid the tariffs, he said.

ìWe have orders that have been placed in Vietnam and in Indonesia and weíre now asking ëCan you move (the orders) back to China?íî Schwall said. Then thereís a scramble to restart canceled orders or ship held-over goods from China, he added, even though tariffs remain higher than they were before Trumpís second term.

ìItís a ëplease continue the orders that were canceledí situation,î he said of communications with Chinese manufacturers, some of whom Schwall said had already furloughed workers, while at least two factories they work with had shut down in the wake of the tariffs.

On the other side of that equation are Chinese manufacturers like Vivi Tong in eastern Zhejiang province, who is preparing to ship goods from her warehouse and for a surge in orders. Her factory makes remote-controlled cars sold by big box retailers in the US.

ìAs a factory, we hope to receive as many orders as possible in these three months and complete production and shipment as soon as possible,î said Tong, adding she ìcannot estimateî what will happen after that period.

According to Chinese state media, suppliers are working overtime and even into the night to meet a surge in demand from US companies clamoring for stalled orders to be shipped within the 90-day window.

Greg Mazza, who owns a lighting company based in Danbury, Connecticut, said he was among those ìacting rapidlyî to receive inventory that had been produced in China earlier, but not shipped out, since he was concerned about increased shipping costs as many companies did the same.

ìWe did release a lot of containers now, or theyíre being released, and we are placing orders,î said Mazza, who noted that he was in a better position than some companies having prepared for tariffs by building up his inventory in the US last year.

However, Mazza said his orders under the new agreement would still face significantly higher tariffs than last year.

ìIf I have to sustain the 55% tariffs I can do that with a small price increase by the time (the goods) land and some program changes internally,î he said, referring to total duties expected to be imposed on his product. He would aim to ìhold the lineî as much as possible instead of raising prices, he added.

But itís not just tariffs that threaten to increase prices for Americans.

Tong, in Zhejiang, said sheíd seen a hike in shipping costs this week amid the broader scramble to restart trade. The cost of shipping one container, previously running at $4,000 for the journey to the US, is now up some 50%, an increase she said was borne by the US buyer. Ultimately, the added cost is likely to be paid by American shoppers.

Danish shipper Maersk, which had seen a 30% to 40% drop in China-US ocean volume in late April, is now adding capacity to its trans-Pacific services after an increase in bookings following the agreement, a spokesperson told CNN.

Ben Tracy, vice president of strategic business development at Vizion, the shipping container tracking firm that observed a 277% surge in bookings for the seven days ending Tuesday, said the ìcontainer export rushî could interfere with what would typically be a peak shipping season in summer.

ìThe question is ñ how long is that (rush) going to last? How much of a backlog has been waiting for bookings and departures ñ and is that going to go on for three weeks, for six weeks?î he said. ìEither way Ö I donít see how thereís enough time for these containers to make their way back to China for the next voyage around the peak season.î

Uncertainty looms
The mad scramble to restart, ramp up or ship out orders from China is all the more complex for businesses due to pervasive uncertainty not only around where US-China tariffs will ultimately land, but also US duties on other countries in the region.

Trump last month announced, and then largely paused, a host of so-called reciprocal tariffs on most countries. Those included high levies on goods from Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam and Cambodia, which had become a destination for companies shifting production from China during Trumpís first trade war.

Now companies that rely on exports from the region are looking at two ticking clocks, one counting down the 90-day pause on tariffs from countries like Vietnam and the other on those from China, as they decide whether to uproot years-long business relationships in China.

Mazza, in Connecticut, said he had been exploring moving some manufacturing to Vietnam, where the set-up process is likely to take about a year and production would eventually cost him about 10% to 15% more per unit than manufacturing in China.

But he said he wasnít ready to give up on China entirely.

ìIím going to do everything I can to not get out of China, because my China factories have been there for me, Iíve been there for them Ö I value partnerships, and relationships and, look, they make my product really good,î he said. ìSo Iím going to fight till the end.î

And for many factories in China looking at the same uncertainty, the question of how to survive, come what may, is the top priority.

ìWe are also working hard to expand other new markets Ö especially Europe, (where our orders) have increased by almost 20%,î Tong said. ìWe need to expand.î",15-May-25,Business,Alicia

"Trump says India has offered America no tariffs, but India says deal not yet complete","President Donald Trump said on Thursday that India has offered to eliminate tariffs on the United States as part of a potential trade deal ñ but New Delhi soon poured cold water on Trumpís claims, saying negotiations were not complete.

ìIndia is the highest ó one of the highest tariff nations in the world. Itís very hard to sell into India, and theyíve offered us a deal where, basically, theyíre willing to literally charge us no tariff,î Trump said during a roundtable with business leaders in Doha, Qatar.

Indiaís foreign minister S. Jaishankar later said talks were ongoing, calling negotiations between New Delhi and Washington ìcomplicatedî and ìintricate.î

ìNegotiations have been going on,î he told reporters in the Indian capital Thursday. ìThese are very complicated negotiations. They are very intricate. Nothing is decided tillÖ everything is.î

The US president said the tariff India places on US goods is ìso highî that it prevents much business from taking place between the two nations. The White House has long criticized Indiaís high tariffs, including 70% on autos, 20% on some networking equipment, 80% on rice imports. It also has chastised India for its non-tariff trade barriers, including burdensome regulatory requirements for importers.

A zero tariff ó if thatís in fact what India is offering ó would be a welcome change for US companies looking to export their goods to the worldís most populous country.

ì(India) have actually told us, I assume you too, (Treasury Secretary) Scott (Bessent)Ö that there will be no tariff, right? Would you say thatís a difference? Theyíre the highest, and now theyíre saying no tariff,î Trump said.

The US is Indiaís largest trade partner as of 2024, yet India ranks tenth in the list of US trading partners for the same year. The trade deficit between the US and India has been widening, with the US importing $45.7 billion more from India than it exported there in 2024, according to data from the US Census Bureau.

India is one of several countries or trading blocks attempting to strike deals with the US after Trumpís sweeping set of tariffs has upended global trade.

Trump has imposed a baseline 10% levy on all goods imported into the US, and threatened to slap so-called ìreciprocal tariffsî at still higher rates on nations in early July. India faces a 26% ìreciprocal tariffî on its goods arriving into the US.

Last week, Trump scored the first big win in his trade war ó a framework for future trade negotiations with Britain that lowers some tariffs on London and potentially opens up the UK market to more American goods.

And, on Monday, the US and China to drastically roll back tariffs on each otherís goods for an initial 90-day period in a surprise breakthrough between the worldís two richest nations.

ëYouíre not treating us rightí
When Trump initially announced plans in February to unveil a package of reciprocal tariffs, he singled out India several times. In particular, the administration has taken issue with Indiaís value-added and digital services taxes as well as the growing goods trade deficit.

ìThey charge more tariffs than any other country,î Trump said on February 13. The comments came hours before he met with Indiaís Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Trump also spoke about India during his Rose Garden ìLiberation Dayî event on April 2. ìIndia, very, very tough,î Trump said. He also mentioned he told Modi when he met with him, ìYouíre not treating us right.î

The White House last month estimated that US exports to India would increase by at least $5.3 billion annually if India dropped its trade barriers ó but itís unclear how the White House arrived at those figures.

The goods trade deficit the US runs with India has nearly doubled since Trumpís first term, though this occurred as both countries roughly doubled the amount of imported goods from one another.

The top goods the US received from India last year included pharmaceuticals; communications equipment, such as smartphones; and apparel. The top American exports to India were various oils and gases, chemicals and aerospace products and parts.",15-May-25,Business,"Bryan Mena, Elisabeth Buchwald",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/15/business/india-no-tariffs-trump-intl,,,,,,,,,,,,president donald trump said thursday india offered eliminate tariffs united states part potential trade deal ‚Äì new delhi soon poured cold water trump‚Äôs claims saying negotiations complete ‚Äúindia highest ‚Äî one highest tariff nations world it‚Äôs hard sell india they‚Äôve offered us deal basically they‚Äôre willing literally charge us tariff‚Äù trump said roundtable business leaders doha qatar india‚Äôs foreign minister s jaishankar later said talks ongoing calling negotiations new delhi washington ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù ‚Äúintricate‚Äù ‚Äúnegotiations going on‚Äù told reporters indian capital thursday ‚Äúthese complicated negotiations intricate nothing decided till‚Ä¶ everything is‚Äù us president said tariff india places us goods ‚Äúso high‚Äù prevents much business taking place two nations white house long criticized india‚Äôs high tariffs including autos networking equipment rice imports also chastised india nontariff trade barriers including burdensome regulatory requirements importers zero tariff ‚Äî that‚Äôs fact india offering ‚Äî welcome change us companies looking export goods world‚Äôs populous country ‚Äúindia actually told us assume treasury secretary scott bessent‚Ä¶ tariff right say that‚Äôs difference they‚Äôre highest now they‚Äôre saying tariff‚Äù trump said us india‚Äôs largest trade partner yet india ranks tenth list us trading partners year trade deficit us india widening us importing billion india exported according data us census bureau india one several countries trading blocks attempting strike deals us trump‚Äôs sweeping set tariffs upended global trade trump imposed baseline levy goods imported us threatened slap socalled ‚Äúreciprocal tariffs‚Äù still higher rates nations early july india faces ‚Äúreciprocal tariff‚Äù goods arriving us last week trump scored first big win trade war ‚Äî framework future trade negotiations britain lowers tariffs london potentially opens uk market american goods monday us china drastically roll back tariffs other‚Äôs goods initial day period surprise breakthrough world‚Äôs two richest nations ‚Äòyou‚Äôre treating us right‚Äô trump initially announced plans february unveil package reciprocal tariffs singled india several times particular administration taken issue india‚Äôs valueadded digital services taxes well growing goods trade deficit ‚Äúthey charge tariffs country‚Äù trump said february comments came hours met india‚Äôs prime minister narendra modi trump also spoke india rose garden ‚Äúliberation day‚Äù event april ‚Äúindia tough‚Äù trump said also mentioned told modi met ‚Äúyou‚Äôre treating us right‚Äù white house last month estimated us exports india increase least billion annually india dropped trade barriers ‚Äî it‚Äôs unclear white house arrived figures goods trade deficit us runs india nearly doubled since trump‚Äôs first term though occurred countries roughly doubled amount imported goods one another top goods us received india last year included pharmaceuticals communications equipment smartphones apparel top american exports india various oils gases chemicals aerospace products parts

"Bullying only leads to self-isolation, Xi says day after US-China tariff truce","Chinese leader Xi Jinping says ìbullyingî and ìhegemonismî will only backfire, in a veiled reference to the United States just a day after a temporary truce was agreed in the trade war between the worldís two largest economies.

Xi chose to deliver this message, which paints China as a global leader and defender of free trade, at a summit of Latin American and Caribbean officials ó including the presidents of Brazil, Colombia and Chile ó in Beijing on Tuesday. The region has become increasingly caught in the middle of a tussle for influence between the US and China.

ìThere are no winners in tariff wars or trade wars. Bullying or hegemonism only leads to self-isolation,î Xi said, reiterating a warning he has made throughout the trade showdown with US President Donald Trump.

Great changes unseen in a century are accelerating, which have ìmade unity and cooperation among nations indispensable,î he added.

Xiís speech comes a day after the US and China announced they would drastically roll back tariffs on each otherís goods for an initial 90-day period, in a surprise breakthrough that has de-escalated a punishing trade war and buoyed global markets.

The US-China trade war has de-escalated
Both countries have agreed to roll back tariffs for a 90-day period starting May 14. China's levies on US imports will go down to 10% while the US lowers its overall tariffs on China to 30% ó this is still higher than the average rate in place before Trumpís second term began. Hereís how the tit-for-tat between the US and China has unfolded since Trump took office.

Announced tariff rates
? on most Chinese goods
? on most US goods
? on certain US goods

While the White House is hailing the tariff pause as a win for the United States and a demonstration of Trumpís ìunparalleled expertise in securing deals that benefit the American people,î Chinese commentators and state-run media are celebrating the agreement as ìa huge victoryî for China and a vindication of Beijingís tough stance.

ìThis shows that Chinaís firm countermeasures and resolute stance have been highly effective,î Yuyuan Tantian, a social media account affiliated with state broadcaster CCTV, wrote on microblog Weibo. ìThe retaliatory measures clearly had a significant impact on the US, prompting its government to lower tariffs to baseline levels following the talks.î

As countries rushed to make deals with Trump after his April 2 announcement of ìreciprocal tariffs,î China took a markedly different approach, standing its ground and retaliating with tariffs on US goods along with a host of other countermeasures.

For over a month, Trumpís second-term tariffs on Chinese imports remained at a staggering 145%, while Chinaís retaliatory levies on US goods held at 125%, a tit-for-tat trade war that was already inflicting economic pain on both sides.

The trade agreement reached over the weekend effectively means the US will temporarily lower its overall tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China will cut its levies on American imports from 125% to 10%, according to the joint statement.

Trumpís 20% fentanyl-related levies on China, imposed in February and March, will stay, so will Chinaís countermeasures against the US for those tariffs. Under the agreement, China will also suspend or cancel its non-tariff countermeasures imposed on the US since April 2.

In addition, the US will cut its ìde minimisî tariff on small packages from China from 120% to 54% starting from May 14, while still maintaining the $100 flat-fee option, according to a White House executive order issued Monday.

A ëhuge victoryí
Chinese state media have cast the reduction in tariffs as being on equal terms, emphasizing that both sides are suspending the 24% ìreciprocal tariffsî for 90 days and removing the 91% additional tariffs mutually imposed during the rapid-fire retaliatory escalation in April.

Under the terms of the agreement, Trumpís ìreciprocalî tariff on China now stands at 10%, the same rate as the levies on the UK, a close American ally, some Chinese users noted on social media.

ìThis is a huge victory for Chinaís commitment to the principles of equality and mutual respect,î Hu Xijin, the former editor of the state-run Global Times, wrote in a Weibo post.

He called the agreement ìa triumph for international trade rules and the rightful global order,î adding that it ìsets an example and is bound to inspire other countries to defend their own rights.î

Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University in Beijing, said Chinaís tough stance was a matter of principle in terms of upholding the multilateral and free trade principles of the World Trade Organization.

ìThis is something China must stand firm on. If even China canít hold the line, wouldnít that mean the whole world has to beg the US for mercy?î he said.

But China also showed flexibility in coming to the negotiation table, Wang said, instead of insisting on its demand that the US must remove all of its unilateral tariffs before any discussion. The agreement bought both sides time, he added.

ìBecause the economic and trade ties between China and the US are so deeply intertwined, both sides are feeling the pain. So the idea is to ease the tension for now and push the problem down the road a bit to resolve the complex and deep-rooted differences gradually,î he said. ìItís like shifting from the original shock therapy to a gradual treatment approach.î

Although the Trump administration is touting the temporary tariff truce with China as a ìwin,î the trade war has inflected great damage to US credibility, including with its allies, Wang said, and that gives China opportunity to strengthen ties with other countries.

ëReady to join handsí
For weeks, China had stood firm against US pressure and launched a diplomatic charm offensive presenting itself as a supporter of global trade, rallying countries to push back against what it calls ìUS bullying.î

On Tuesday, Xi continued that push despite the trade truce, vowing to strengthen ìsolidarityî with Latin America and the Caribbean, a region that Trump has sought to pull closer to Washingtonís orbit. Trade between China and the region exceeded $500 billion for the first time last year, the Chinese leader said.

Xi was speaking at the opening of the fourth ministerial meeting of the China-CELAC Forum, a gathering founded in 2014 to strengthen Chinaís influence in Latin America and the Caribbean ó and challenge Americaís traditional dominance in the region. CELAC stands for the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States.

ìChina and Latin American and Caribbean countries are important members of the Global South. Independence and autonomy are our glorious tradition. Development and revitalization are our inherent right. And fairness and justness are our common pursuit,î Xi said.

ìIn the face of seething undercurrents of geopolitical and bloc confrontation, and the surging tide of unilateralism and protectionism, China stands ready to join hands with our Latin American and Caribbean partners,î he added.

The Chinese leader also vowed to provide 66 billion yuan ($9.2 billion) worth of credit lines to CELAC countries to support their development. The credit lines will be denominated in yuan, a move that is part of larger efforts to popularize the Chinese currency in the region.

Trumps egg price fiction has suddenly become reality,"For months, President Donald Trump has falsely claimed that egg prices are tumbling. It wasnít true then, but itís true now.

Egg prices fell 12.7% last month, the biggest monthly decline since 1984, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday. And they could continue to fall this month, too: The USDA reported last week that a dozen large white-shell eggs now cost $3.30 on average, down a whopping 69 cents from a week before.

Itís a remarkable reversal after egg prices surged in each of the past five months ñ and 17 of the past 19 months ñ because of a deadly avian flu epidemic that necessitated the mass culling of egg-laying hens.

ìMaybe the worst of EggGate has passed,î Tyler Schipper, associate professor in economics and data analysis at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota, told CNN.

Nevertheless, egg prices remain significantly higher now than before the latest bird flu outbreak, and they cost 49.3% more last month than they did a year earlier. Eggs are still more expensive than when Trump took office, according to the BLS. Egg prices this past Easter, which typically rise in the run-up to the holiday, were the highest for any Easter on record, the USDA reported.

Well before last monthís decline, Trump had been touting falling egg prices as a sign that his administrationís plan to lower prices for consumers has been working. In February, the USDA announced an initiative to lower egg prices, including increased biosecurity on egg-laying farms, aid to farmers who have lost flocks and temporary lifting of restrictions on egg imports.

Despite Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollinsí far more conservative estimate that egg prices would normalize in the summer, Trump last month said, ìas you know, the cost of eggs has come down like 93, 94% since we took office.î Those percentage declines Trump stated are not close to accurate ñ but we now know that consumer egg prices were, indeed, falling sharply when Trump made those remarks (the Consumer Price Index data wasnít out yet to confirm or deny Trumpís claims).

It appears as though Trump may have been talking about wholesale prices, which had been tumbling throughout March before normalizing in recent weeks. Nevertheless, wholesale prices fell by half ñ not close to the 90%+ figures Trump was citing.

Wholesale prices are the costs distributors pay to farmers or middlemen. Consumer prices are what customers pay at grocery stores. Those costs typically make their way through the supply chain at a slower pace, because grocery stores may decide to keep prices at a certain price, even when wholesale prices change, to try to recoup lost profits from prior weeks, according to Kevin Bergquist, sector manager at Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute.

The USDA says consumer prices finally fell as demand for eggs decreased and avian flu cases have fallen. Many groceries, including large chains like Costco, had limited customersí purchases because of egg shortages.

So Trumpís claim that consumer egg prices are down is finally true ñ even if the timing of his claim and the wild percentages he threw around were grossly inaccurate.",13-May-25,Business,Alicia Wallace,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/13/business/egg-prices-trump-inflation,,,,,,,,,,,,months president donald trump falsely claimed egg prices tumbling wasn‚Äôt true it‚Äôs true now egg prices fell last month biggest monthly decline since bureau labor statistics reported tuesday continue fall month usda reported last week dozen large whiteshell eggs now cost average whopping cents week it‚Äôs remarkable reversal egg prices surged past five months ‚Äì past months ‚Äì deadly avian flu epidemic necessitated mass culling egglaying hens ‚Äúmaybe worst egggate passed‚Äù tyler schipper associate professor economics data analysis university st thomas st paul minnesota told cnn nevertheless egg prices remain significantly higher now latest bird flu outbreak cost last month year earlier eggs still expensive trump took office according bls egg prices past easter typically rise runup holiday highest easter record usda reported well last month‚Äôs decline trump touting falling egg prices sign administration‚Äôs plan lower prices consumers working february usda announced initiative lower egg prices including increased biosecurity egglaying farms aid farmers lost flocks temporary lifting restrictions egg imports despite agriculture secretary brooke rollins‚Äô far conservative estimate egg prices normalize summer trump last month said ‚Äúas know cost eggs come like since took office‚Äù percentage declines trump stated close accurate ‚Äì now know consumer egg prices indeed falling sharply trump made remarks consumer price index data wasn‚Äôt yet confirm deny trump‚Äôs claims appears though trump may talking wholesale prices tumbling throughout march normalizing recent weeks nevertheless wholesale prices fell half ‚Äì close figures trump citing wholesale prices costs distributors pay farmers middlemen consumer prices customers pay grocery stores costs typically make way supply chain slower pace grocery stores may decide keep prices certain price even wholesale prices change try recoup lost profits prior weeks according kevin bergquist sector manager wells fargo agrifood institute usda says consumer prices finally fell demand eggs decreased avian flu cases fallen many groceries including large chains like costco limited customers‚Äô purchases egg shortages trump‚Äôs claim consumer egg prices finally true ‚Äì even timing claim wild percentages threw around grossly inaccurate
Prices are changing. See how much the cost of basic grocery items has shifted,"The cost of food in the US increased significantly amid the Covid-19 pandemic and the steep inflation that followed. While prices have stabilized more recently, new factors have already driven up the costs for eggs and threaten to increase them for other common household foods.

The price of eggs could increase by as much as 20% this year, according to one government forecast, after detections of avian influenza among the nationís poultry flocks have strained supply. And the looming prospect of new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada ó two of the largest suppliers of agricultural products to the US ó could have a major impact on the cost of filling American pantries. President Donald Trump announced massive tariffs on dozens of nations on April 2.

CNN is tracking price trends for various household staples each month. Select a product below to see how its costs have shifted over time.

The costs for some products could remain volatile, but the overall trend shows prices have largely stabilized. For example, government economists also track inflation for foods Americans eat at home to better understand price trends across all products at the grocery store.

"Nissan more than doubles layoffs to around 20,000","Nissan unveiled sweeping new cost cuts Tuesday, saying it would eliminate 11,000 more jobs and scale back production, capping a tumultuous year that has left the Japanese automaker fighting to turn itself around.

The new layoffs will bring Nissanís total workforce reduction to around 20,000 jobs, after it previously announced plans to cut 9,000 positions.

Nissan saw its profit almost wiped out in the financial year just ended. Operating profit totaled 69.8 billion yen ($472 million) in the 12 months to March, a decline of 88% from the previous year.

Nissan has been badly damaged by weakening sales in the United States and China, then saw merger talks with Honda (HMC) collapse and was recently forced to replace its chief executive. Like rivals, it is also being squeezed by US tariffs and threatened by fast-rising Chinese electric vehicle makers in markets in Southeast Asia and elsewhere.

New CEO Ivan Espinosa now faces the difficult job of turning around an automaker that has seen its once-mighty brand value eroded.

The results were a ìwake-up call,î he said at a press conference. Still, a sudden turnaround seems unlikely ñ the automaker expects a 200 billion yen operating loss in the first quarter, CFO Jeremie Papin said.

Analysts have said Nissan is now paying the price for years under former Chairman Carlos Ghosn when it focused too heavily on sales volume and used heavy discounts to keep cars moving off lots. That has left it with an aging line-up that it is now scrambling to update.

Espinosa said Nissan must prioritize self-improvement with greater urgency and speed, and aim for profitability by relying less on volume.

It is aiming for total cost savings of 500 billion yen versus the 2024 financial year. This will see it cut the number of its production plants to 10 from 17 and reduce the complexity of parts by 70%.",13-May-25,Business,Hadas Gold,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/13/business/nissan-job-cuts-intl,,,,,,,,,,,,nissan unveiled sweeping new cost cuts tuesday saying eliminate jobs scale back production capping tumultuous year left japanese automaker fighting turn around new layoffs bring nissan‚Äôs total workforce reduction around jobs previously announced plans cut positions nissan saw profit almost wiped financial year just ended operating profit totaled billion yen million months march decline previous year nissan badly damaged weakening sales united states china saw merger talks honda hmc collapse recently forced replace chief executive like rivals also squeezed us tariffs threatened fastrising chinese electric vehicle makers markets southeast asia elsewhere new ceo ivan espinosa now faces difficult job turning around automaker seen oncemighty brand value eroded results ‚Äúwakeup call‚Äù said press conference still sudden turnaround seems unlikely ‚Äì automaker expects billion yen operating loss first quarter cfo jeremie papin said analysts said nissan now paying price years former chairman carlos ghosn focused heavily sales volume used heavy discounts keep cars moving lots left aging lineup now scrambling update espinosa said nissan must prioritize selfimprovement greater urgency speed aim profitability relying less volume aiming total cost savings billion yen versus financial year see cut number production plants reduce complexity parts
"Tariffs have already made mattresses, strollers and power tools more expensive","President Donald Trumpís unpredictable trade policies and public threats against companies have made it nearly impossible to set prices.

The Trump administration temporarily reduced tariffs on China over the weekend, but import taxes have already made baby gear, power drills, mattresses and other everyday products more expensive for Americans. Companies have been raising prices to survive cost increases from both 10% universal tariffs on every product entering the United States and higher levies on Chinese goods, at 30% even after an agreement between Washington and Beijing.

The Federal Reserve said last week that tariffs have led to a 0.3% increase in prices this year. Some companies are increasing the prices of all of their products. Others are hiking targeted items in their catalogs. Many are just eliminating the products that will cause sticker shock rather than try to sell at prices either customers wonít buy or competitors will undercut, companies and analysts say.

ìIf you raise prices too much demand goes down and you lose market share,î said Z. John Zhang, a professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania who researches pricing strategies. ìThe fate of your company is in the hands of people making pricing decisions.î

Itís not just market forces making it tricker ó companies must also navigate the politics of raising prices. Companies typically communicate why they need to raise prices, but Trump has made doing so a political risk.

The White House took aggressive aim at Amazon last month after the company considered displaying the added cost of tariffs on some items, with Trump putting in an angry call to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Trump also threatened Mattel last week after the toymaker said it planned to raise prices because of tariffs.

Business advisors are encouraging companies to talk about a range of forces impacting pricing decisions, rather than blaming price increases specifically on tariffs.

ìCompanies should talk about how pricing helps to balance supply and demand, achieve profitability and reflect value,î said David Garfield, the co-CEO of consulting firm AlixPartners.

Companies raising prices
Companies across industries have been hiking prices since tariffs first went into effect last month. Once prices go up, companies rarely lower them.

Telsey Advisory Group, which has started to track online prices of dozens of clothing, sporting goods, home furnishings and other products in response to tariffs, found ìsmall, select increasesî in April and expects more price hikes in the coming months, said analyst Dana Telsey.

ìThese are carefully crafted equations,î she said.

In April, Stanley Black & Decker, the owner of Dewalt, Craftsman, Black + Decker and other power tool brands, raised prices by an average of high single-digits because of tariffs. It plans to introduce a second round of increases later in the year, the company said on an earnings call.

ìOur business teams are continuously assessing the evolving trade policies and diligently evaluating their impacts on our global supply chain and our business,î CEO Donald Allan said.

Stanley Black & Decker declined to comment to CNN.

Yeti also raised prices on 14 items in April, including coolers by an average of 7%, water bottles and tumblers by an average of 11% and dog bowls by an average of 22%, according to Baird analysts. Yeti did not respond to CNNís request for comment.

Avocado Green Mattresses last week increased mattress prices by 6% and other products by an average of 7.5%, the company told the New York Times. Avocado declined to comment to CNN.

Therabody is raising prices this month on its massage guns and other items by as much as 15%, the company told Bloomberg. Therabody did not respond to CNN.

Baby goods company UPPAbaby raised prices on its strollers, car seats and other infant products on May 5 because of tariffs, the company told customers. UPPAbabyís strollers are manufactured in China.

ìWhile weíve made every effort behind the scenes to absorb as much of the cost as possible, some price increases are unfortunately unavoidable,î UPPAbaby said on its website last month. ìThis was a tough decision, made only after exhausting every other option.î

UPPAbaby declined to comment to CNN on its pricing strategy.

Picking a price tag
Pricing strategies are not one-size-fits-all decisions.

For example, luxury brands offering non-essential goods to higher-income customers have more room to raise prices without losing sales compared to discount retailers selling to consumers on tight budgets.

ìYou might see a disproportionate pricing impact on items based on demand,î said Alexander Chernev, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University who studies consumer behavior and brandsí strategies.

Pricing strategies will also depend on how critical an item is to customersí overall perceptions of the brand.

Grocery stores, for example, will often artificially keep the prices for milk and eggs loweró ìknown value itemsî in industry parlance ó and take a loss to draw in customers while raising prices elsewhere.

ìRetailers might price high-demand, frequently-purchased products more competitivelyî to maintain customer perceptions, Chernev said.

ëIt wonít sell at $89í
Companies are hiking prices on products they think customers will still buy even if theyíre more expensive and eliminating ones that wonít sell with a higher price tag.

ìHow much can a consumer bear before itís priced out of the market? I canít just take an item that is $29.99 and make it $50 and expect people to buy it,î said Steve Rad, the CEO of interactive toy and game company Abacus Brands. ìItís a very granular approach.î

Like most toymakers, Abacus imports its products from China. The company last week planned to raise prices of Pixicade, which turns kidsí drawings on paper into video games, from $29.99 to $39.99 because of 145% tariffs on China.

But Rad said Monday he will hold the price at $29.99 with lower 30% tariffs on China.

ìGiven todayís news on tariffs, Pixicade will not see a price increase,î Rad said.

The company is eliminating MasterChef, an interactive cooking game that sells for $59.99, because prices would rise to $89.99.

ìIt wonít sell at $89,î he said.

Thatís not the only product ó Abacus is cutting around half of its 85 different products this year because the company believes cost increases will price consumers out of buying them.

ìOur import strategy is now squarely focused on proven winners,î he said.",13-May-25,Business,Marshall

Millennials are giving Gen Z advice for their first potential recession,"Many of the generation were young adults when the Great Recession began, and to this day, they struggle to buy homes and pay off student debt. Now these jaded millennials are sharing their wisdom with Gen Z on TikTok, posting preparation tips and no-buy lists to ease the minds of young people who could be entering their first major recession as adults.

President Donald Trumpís whiplash-inducing policy changes have everyone warning about dire consequences for the US economy, from Fed Chair Jerome Powell to Goldman Sachs analysts. The Trump administrationís tit-for-tat escalation in the global trade war could lead to a recession for both the US and the world this year, JPMorgan said this month. It comes during an already unprecedented string of events for young people ó people in their early 20s are earning less and have more debt, already battered by the Covid-19 pandemic and an onslaught of inflation.

So, the United States might not be in a recession right now, but its youngest working adults are still anxious ó and seeking advice from their older peers.

When scrolling through TikTok, Sasha Whitney, 37, noticed Gen Z users shared the same feelings over an impending recession: ìdowntrodden, frustrated, very bleak and hopeless about the future.î

Itís a stark difference from when Whitney graduated from college in 2009 during the Great Recession, before social media became as pervasive and when Barack Obama, who ran his campaign on the concept of hope, just took office.

ìWhen I talked to some of my millennial friends, they were like, ëYeah, we were broke. We were struggling,íî said Whitney, whose primary audience on TikTok is aged 18 to 25 years old. ìHowever, we werenít trying to keep up with the Joneses. You werenít trying to portray a lifestyle for social media.î

Other millennials joked on social media about the sense of community they had during the recession, sounding nostalgic for the days of cheaper liquor, wearing business casual and endless replays of feel-good recession pop. ìIf you want to know how we survived, yeah we blacked out,î one millennial user quipped on TikTok.

But millennials did share their real financial struggles. After graduating, Whitney lived at home for a bit, then moved out, paying rent and student loans and leaving $20 a week for groceries. She worked in retail immediately out of college and figured out how to handle her finances through trial and error.

ìIím buying packs of tuna, frozen vegetables, bread, putting it in the freezer. Thatís when it really hit me that somethingís going on,î she said.

Whitneyís TikTok video walked viewers through some recession tips, including: taking whatever job you can get, living below your means, and deleting payment platforms like Klarna and After Pay. Other videos from millennials on TikTok offer recession preparation guides, such has having an emergency savings fund and updated resumes.

ìIf I can give somebody advice, especially younger folks, thatís what Iím going to do,î Whitney said.

Living below your means
Many TikTokers are vowing to do one thing: limit their spending.

For Imani Smith, a 29-year-old in Dallas, that means password-sharing subscriptions with her friends and cutting back on going out to eat.

Beauty maintenance is also a high cost, so she buys press-on nails from Amazon instead of going to the salon. Salon owners are reporting more requests for ìrecession blonde,î cheaper, more low-maintenance hairstyles.

And despite the famous lipstick index ó the theory that small ìtreat yourselfî purchases uptick during economic downturns ó social media users have promised to cut out small purchases like expensive lip balms and candles.

ìI want to (save) and build a practice of doing it before I have to do it out of basic necessity,î Smith, who described herself as in between a Gen Z and millennial, told CNN. She added that she uses TikTok, like many young people, as a search engine. In a video on TikTok, she asked viewers who were adults in 2008 whether her recession plan was good enough.

When people sense their budgets contracting, they have to decide what theyíre going to spend on, Simon Blanchard, a professor at Georgetown Universityís McDonough School of Business, said to CNN. He added it may be a good time to self-reflect if you have enough emergency savings, whether weíre in a recession or not.

People tend to cut an entire category of spending rather than a little bit of everything, so it doesnít seem like they have to downgrade on every part of their life, Blanchard said.

ìAnd maybe those small indulgences like lipstick are the things that might be first to go because theyíre just non-essential,î Blanchard said.

For Gen Z, more anxiety and uncertainty
Despite the advice from millennials to let go and live, as all the great music of the mid-2000s encouraged, anxiety still persists among many young people.

After talking to people who lived through 2008, Smith said that ìthey mightíve lost their jobs, but the cost of living was so low back then that they could have picked up something retail and held themselves afloat for a while,î emphasizing her worries for the job market right now.

For many young people, their anxiety goes back to the Covid-19 pandemic. Smith had just started working her first corporate job when the pandemic hit, triggering the shortest recession in US history that ended after two months in April 2020.

ìIt put me in the mindset that I need to be prepared for anything,î Smith said. ìBecause none of us could have anticipated Covid-19 and the lasting effects that had.î",27-Apr-25,Business,Jeff Seltzer,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/27/business/millennials-gen-z-recession-advice,,,,,,,,,,,,many generation young adults great recession began day struggle buy homes pay student debt now jaded millennials sharing wisdom gen z tiktok posting preparation tips nobuy lists ease minds young people entering first major recession adults president donald trump‚Äôs whiplashinducing policy changes everyone warning dire consequences us economy fed chair jerome powell goldman sachs analysts trump administration‚Äôs titfortat escalation global trade war lead recession us world year jpmorgan said month comes already unprecedented string events young people ‚Äî people early s earning less debt already battered covid pandemic onslaught inflation united states might recession right now youngest working adults still anxious ‚Äî seeking advice older peers scrolling tiktok sasha whitney noticed gen z users shared feelings impending recession ‚Äúdowntrodden frustrated bleak hopeless future‚Äù it‚Äôs stark difference whitney graduated college great recession social media became pervasive barack obama ran campaign concept hope just took office sasha whitney content creator tiktok gives tips gen z viewers preparing first major recession sasha whitney content creator tiktok gives tips gen z viewers preparing first major recession courtesy sasha whitney ‚Äúwhen talked millennial friends like ‚Äòyeah broke struggling‚Äô‚Äù said whitney whose primary audience tiktok aged years old ‚Äúhowever weren‚Äôt trying keep joneses weren‚Äôt trying portray lifestyle social media‚Äù millennials joked social media sense community recession sounding nostalgic days cheaper liquor wearing business casual endless replays feelgood recession pop ‚Äúif want know survived yeah blacked out‚Äù one millennial user quipped tiktok millennials share real financial struggles graduating whitney lived home bit moved paying rent student loans leaving week groceries worked retail immediately college figured handle finances trial error ‚Äúi‚Äôm buying packs tuna frozen vegetables bread putting freezer that‚Äôs really hit something‚Äôs going on‚Äù said whitney‚Äôs tiktok video walked viewers recession tips including taking whatever job can get living means deleting payment platforms like klarna pay videos millennials tiktok offer recession preparation guides emergency savings fund updated resumes ‚Äúif can give somebody advice especially younger folks that‚Äôs i‚Äôm going do‚Äù whitney said living means many tiktokers vowing one thing limit spending imani smith yearold dallas means passwordsharing subscriptions friends cutting back going eat beauty maintenance also high cost buys presson nails amazon instead going salon salon owners reporting requests ‚Äúrecession blonde‚Äù cheaper lowmaintenance hairstyles despite famous lipstick index ‚Äî theory small ‚Äútreat yourself‚Äù purchases uptick economic downturns ‚Äî social media users promised cut small purchases like expensive lip balms candles ‚Äúi want save build practice basic necessity‚Äù smith described gen z millennial told cnn added uses tiktok like many young people search engine video tiktok asked viewers adults whether recession plan good enough imani smith describes gen z millennial asked viewers feedback recession plan recent tiktok video imani smith describes gen z millennial asked viewers feedback recession plan recent tiktok video courtesy imani smith people sense budgets contracting decide they‚Äôre going spend simon blanchard professor georgetown university‚Äôs mcdonough school business said cnn added may good time selfreflect enough emergency savings whether we‚Äôre recession people tend cut entire category spending rather little bit everything doesn‚Äôt seem like downgrade every part life blanchard said ‚Äúand maybe small indulgences like lipstick things might first go they‚Äôre just nonessential‚Äù blanchard said gen z anxiety uncertainty despite advice millennials let go live great music mids encouraged anxiety still persists among many young people talking people lived smith said ‚Äúthey might‚Äôve lost jobs cost living low back picked something retail held afloat while‚Äù emphasizing worries job market right now many young people anxiety goes back covid pandemic smith just started working first corporate job pandemic hit triggering shortest recession us history ended two months april ‚Äúit put mindset need prepared anything‚Äù smith said ‚Äúbecause none us anticipated covid lasting effects had‚Äù
Trump says he has a little problem with Tim Cook,"President Donald Trump isnít pleased with Apple CEO Tim Cookís plan to manufacture iPhones bound for the United States at newly built plants in India.

ìI had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,î Trump said Thursday in Qatar. ìI said to him, ëTim, youíre my friend. I treated you very good. Youíre coming in with $500 billion.í But now I hear youíre building all over India. I donít want you building in India.íî

Trump has levied historic tariffs on practically all goods coming into the United States to boost domestic manufacturing, improve the balance of trade and bring in revenue to pay for his planned tax cut, among other aims.

Although some companies, including Apple, have announced plans to increase production in the United States to avoid high tariffs, factories take years to build and American labor remains expensive. Corporate America canít just flip a switch and start making everything in the United States.

Trump said Apple can build in India ìto take care of Indiaî and claimed that Apple is ìupping their production in the United States.î (Apple didnít immediately respond for comment.)

His comments follow Appleís decision to shift production of iPhones sold in the United States from China to India so Apple can avoid paying higher tariffs. The company said that tariffs could add $900 million to its costs this quarter.

Cook said on a call with analysts earlier this month that he expected ìthe majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin.î

Apple had working to shift some iPhone production to India for years, building new factories in the country and hiring staff. The company has no ability to produce iPhones in the United States, and, given the complexity of its supply chain, probably wonít build its most popular product in America anytime soon.

Although the Trump administration is eager to get Apple to bring iPhone production here, itís an ambition that analysts have said is nearly impossible to achieve because of high costs.

The price of an iPhone could triple to $3,500 if they were made here, according to Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities,

Apple previously announced in February a $500 billion plan on expanding US facilities over the next four years that would create 20,000 jobs.

The investment builds on Appleís previous efforts to expand its supply chain outside of China in recent years, partly in response to production issues in the country during the pandemic.

"Jamie Dimon continues to warn of recession, despite pullback in China tariffs","While many economists are saying the risk of an imminent recession has diminished since China and the United States agreed to lower tariffs earlier this week, JPMorgan Chaseís CEO, Jamie Dimon, is still penciling one in.

ìI wouldnít take it off the table at this point,î Dimon said in a Bloomberg TV interview on Thursday at an annual conference the bank hosts in Paris.

After the trade breakthrough from weekend talks in Geneva between Trump administration officials and Chinese government officials, JPMorgan economists lowered the risk of the US economy entering a recession to below 50% from 60% previously.

Dimon said the agreement the US reached with China, which entailed the US lowering tariffs on most Chinese goods to a minimum of 30% from 145% and China lowering tariffs on most American goods to 10% from 125% for the next three months, was ìthe right thing to do.î

ìIt obviously calms down the markets. Thatís not the reason to do it, but the markets do vote, or something like that,î he said. After the deal was announced on Monday, US stocks surged, with the Dow closing nearly 1,200 points higher on that day. Now the index is just barely in negative territory for the year after it, along with other major indexes, fell sharply last month after President Donald Trump rolled out a slew of higher tariffs.

Meanwhile, the Nasdaq, which had entered a bear market on April 4, closed up more than 20% earlier this week from its lowest point this year ó exiting its bear market and marking the start of a new bull market. (A rise of 20% from a recent low generally marks a bull market.)

The considerable volatility financial markets experienced over the past few months has benefited JPMorgan Chase because it resulted in higher trading volume, Dimon said. But that isnít always the case when markets see big swings. ìThis one happened to be good. The next go around may not be so good,î he said.

End of American exceptionalism?
For decades, investors across the globe have flocked to invest in American financial assets, especially government-backed debt during times of heightened uncertainty because of the perceived stability. But thereís a looming question over whether the ìAmerican brandî has been tarnished due to the trade war Trump has picked, which has pushed investors to look abroad to other markets, such as Europe.

Dimon challenged the notion that American companies have a leg up over foreign ones. ìYou do not have a divine right to success,î he said, before naming a slew of American businesses that have failed.

ìWe shouldnít assume itís forever,î he said, referring to American exceptionalism. But at the same time, he pushed back at the view that America has lost its luster as a place to invest, saying: ìIf you were to take all of your money and put it in one country, it would still be America.î

Dimon said during the Thursday interview that he does not see Trump regularly but speaks to ìall of the folks there.î

He also said he believes Franceís President Emmanuel Macron ìis one of the best political leaders on the planet today.î",15-May-25,Business,Elisabeth Buchwald,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/15/economy/dimon-recession-tariffs,,,,,,,,,,,,many economists saying risk imminent recession diminished since china united states agreed lower tariffs earlier week jpmorgan chase‚Äôs ceo jamie dimon still penciling one ‚Äúi wouldn‚Äôt take table point‚Äù dimon said bloomberg tv interview thursday annual conference bank hosts paris trade breakthrough weekend talks geneva trump administration officials chinese government officials jpmorgan economists lowered risk us economy entering recession previously dimon said agreement us reached china entailed us lowering tariffs chinese goods minimum china lowering tariffs american goods next three months ‚Äúthe right thing do‚Äù ‚Äúit obviously calms markets that‚Äôs reason markets vote something like that‚Äù said deal announced monday us stocks surged dow closing nearly points higher day now index just barely negative territory year along major indexes fell sharply last month president donald trump rolled slew higher tariffs meanwhile nasdaq entered bear market april closed earlier week lowest point year ‚Äî exiting bear market marking start new bull market rise recent low generally marks bull market considerable volatility financial markets experienced past months benefited jpmorgan chase resulted higher trading volume dimon said isn‚Äôt always case markets see big swings ‚Äúthis one happened good next go around may good‚Äù said end american exceptionalism decades investors across globe flocked invest american financial assets especially governmentbacked debt times heightened uncertainty perceived stability there‚Äôs looming question whether ‚Äúamerican brand‚Äù tarnished due trade war trump picked pushed investors look abroad markets europe dimon challenged notion american companies leg foreign ones ‚Äúyou divine right success‚Äù said naming slew american businesses failed ‚Äúwe shouldn‚Äôt assume it‚Äôs forever‚Äù said referring american exceptionalism time pushed back view america lost luster place invest saying ‚Äúif take money put one country still america‚Äù dimon said thursday interview see trump regularly speaks ‚Äúall folks there‚Äù also said believes france‚Äôs president emmanuel macron ‚Äúis one best political leaders planet today‚Äù
New Jersey rail strike could cause nightmare for commuters  and Shakira and Beyonc fans,"Engineers at New Jersey Transit are poised to go on strike one minute after midnight Friday morning, a stoppage that would create huge problems for 100,000 daily train commuters, businesses across the New York metropolitan area as well as fans of Shakira and BeyoncÈ, who will have trouble getting to concerts the two stars have planned in upcoming shows.

The railroad and its engineers appear far apart from reaching an 11th hour deal that would avert the strike after 87% of rank-and file members of the International Brotherhood of Engineers and Trainmen voted against a previous tentative deal that would have given them their first raise since 2019.

Railroad officials are urging the commuters who ride its trains daily to make other plans and to work from home, if possible. The majority of commuters on the nationís third-largest commuter railroad use New Jersey Transit to get to their jobs in New York City.

Besides the congestion that will likely clog the bridges and tunnels that span the Hudson River, many commuters to the city would be hit with up to a $9 ìcongestion pricingî toll, in addition to bridge and tunnel tolls that can cost more than twice that amount.

Terms of the rejected deal were not disclosed, but the union had gone into the negotiations seeking raises of 18% to 23% for its 500 members. The union says its members are paid about about 20% less than their counterparts at Amtrak, and three other commuter railroads in the region.

ìWe, the locomotive engineers of NJ Transit are asking only for a fair and competitive wage,î said Thomas Haas, the general chairman of the unionís unit representing the nearly 500 engineers at the railroad, in remarks Wednesday night before the meeting of NJ Transitís board. ìWe are now almost out of time to solve this problem before a work stoppage takes place. The last thing we want to see is that (service) to be interrupted. But weíre at the end of our rope.î

After the meeting, NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri told reporters that heís still confident a strike can be avoided.

ìWe reached a deal once before. It unfortunately got voted down. But we have 29 hours left before a strike would start,î he said.

Kolluri also pointed out that the agency recently reached a deal with its bus drivers. He said the two sides would be at the table Thursday, trying to reach a new deal.

ìWhat I can represent to you is that the conversations have been constructive,î he said. ìWeíre all trying to work towards the same objective.î

But he said a deal would need to be one that is ìfiscally responsible.î

Beyond the commuters who use the trains to get to and from jobs, mostly in New York City, the strike could cause huge problems for fans of Shakira, who is set to perform at MetLife Stadium Thursday and Friday night, less than 10 miles from the Lincoln Tunnel that links New Jersey and Manhattan, and for fans of BeyoncÈ, who is due to perform there for a series of five shows starting next Thursday.

NJ Transit has already canceled service to Thursdayís Shakira show. Concertgoers who drive to the Shakira or the BeyoncÈ shows could find themselves stuck in worse-than-normal traffic as other regular train passengers are forced onto the road.

Congress unlikely to act to end strike
Railroads operate under an arcane century-old federal law, the Railway Labor Act, that controls labor relations at railroads and airlines, greatly limiting the unionís ability to go on strike. Even when members of a union reject a contract, as has happened in this case, they can be ordered to stay on the job and accept the terms of the deal through an act of Congress.

Thatís what happened in December of 2022, when Congress voted in favor of a deal rejected by the majority of the more than 100,000 union members who work at the nationís four major freight railroads.

But itís not clear that Congress will feel as compelled to act in the case of a single commuter railroad as it was in the case of the freight railroads. While Congress has not stood by and allowed the nationís freight railroads to have a strike longer than a few hours, there have been numerous examples of commuter rail strikes that have stretched on for weeks, even months without Congressional action to end it.

Back in 1983, New Jersey Transit was on strike for one month. Also in the 1980s, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority (SEPTA) was on strike for 108 days, Metro North, which is the commuter line serving the suburbs north of New York, was on strike for 42 days, and an 11-day work stoppage occurred on the Long Island Railroad.",15-May-25,Business,Chris Isidore,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/15/business/new-jersey-transit-rail-strike,,,,,,,,,,,,engineers new jersey transit poised go strike one minute midnight friday morning stoppage create huge problems daily train commuters businesses across new york metropolitan area well fans shakira beyonc√© trouble getting concerts two stars planned upcoming shows railroad engineers appear far apart reaching th hour deal avert strike rankand file members international brotherhood engineers trainmen voted previous tentative deal given first raise since railroad officials urging commuters ride trains daily make plans work home possible majority commuters nation‚Äôs thirdlargest commuter railroad use new jersey transit get jobs new york city besides congestion likely clog bridges tunnels span hudson river many commuters city hit ‚Äúcongestion pricing‚Äù toll addition bridge tunnel tolls can cost twice amount terms rejected deal disclosed union gone negotiations seeking raises members union says members paid less counterparts amtrak three commuter railroads region ‚Äúwe locomotive engineers nj transit asking fair competitive wage‚Äù said thomas haas general chairman union‚Äôs unit representing nearly engineers railroad remarks wednesday night meeting nj transit‚Äôs board ‚Äúwe now almost time solve problem work stoppage takes place last thing want see service interrupted we‚Äôre end rope‚Äù meeting nj transit ceo kris kolluri told reporters he‚Äôs still confident strike can avoided ‚Äúwe reached deal unfortunately got voted hours left strike start‚Äù said kolluri also pointed agency recently reached deal bus drivers said two sides table thursday trying reach new deal ‚Äúwhat can represent conversations constructive‚Äù said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre trying work towards objective‚Äù said deal need one ‚Äúfiscally responsible‚Äù beyond commuters use trains get jobs mostly new york city strike cause huge problems fans shakira set perform metlife stadium thursday friday night less miles lincoln tunnel links new jersey manhattan fans beyonc√© due perform series five shows starting next thursday nj transit already canceled service thursday‚Äôs shakira show concertgoers drive shakira beyonc√© shows find stuck worsethannormal traffic regular train passengers forced onto road congress unlikely act end strike railroads operate arcane centuryold federal law railway labor act controls labor relations railroads airlines greatly limiting union‚Äôs ability go strike even members union reject contract happened case can ordered stay job accept terms deal act congress that‚Äôs happened december congress voted favor deal rejected majority union members work nation‚Äôs four major freight railroads it‚Äôs clear congress feel compelled act case single commuter railroad case freight railroads congress stood allowed nation‚Äôs freight railroads strike longer hours numerous examples commuter rail strikes stretched weeks even months without congressional action end back new jersey transit strike one month also s southeastern pennsylvania transit authority septa strike days metro north commuter line serving suburbs north new york strike days day work stoppage occurred long island railroad
Powell warns of more volatile inflation as latest data shows impact from tariffs,"US wholesale prices sank in April, logging their biggest monthly drop since Covid stifled the economy, as tariffs put a squeeze on profit margins, according to new data released Thursday.

The Producer Price Index, a closely watched measurement of wholesale inflation, showed Thursday that the prices paid to US producers dropped 0.5% in April from the month before, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

On an annual basis, inflation slowed to 2.4% from March, which saw sharp upward revisions to the initial estimates. A 0.4% monthly decline and a 2.7% annual rate were revised up to 0% and 3.4%, respectively.

Economists were expecting monthly prices to rise in April by 0.2% and to slow to 2.4% on an annual basis, according to FactSet.

A driving force behind the downward monthly swing was a 1.7% plunge in trade services, a category that measures gross margins for wholesalers and retailers.

Although itís a volatile category, the sharp downward swing in trade services indicates that companiesí margins are being eaten away by higher costs from President Donald Trumpís tariffs, Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, told CNN on Thursday.

ìWe are beginning to see the impact of trade policy filtering into the hard data in such a way that itís impossible to deny that it is now affecting revenues and profit margins for firms,î Brusuelas said.

Those higher costs will likely start spilling over to consumers soon, he said.

And the economy-powering consumers are already showing some signs of fatigue: Sales at US retailers slowed sharply in April to 0.1% after a surge of 1.7% in March, when shoppers rushed to beat the slew of new tariffs.

Increased volatility could keep interest rates elevated
Separately on Thursday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that ìsupply shocksî could force the central bank to keep rates higher over the long term.

ìWe may be entering a period of more frequent, and potentially more persistent, supply shocks ó a difficult challenge for the economy and for central banks,î Powell said.

He noted that ìinflation could be more volatile going forward than in the inter-crisis period of the 2010s.î

On Tuesday, the latest Consumer Price Index data showed that overall inflation cooled further for the goods and services Americans commonly purchase. However, some economists pegged some of that softening to weaker demand.

Trumpís bevy of tariffs is widely expected to make items more expensive in the months to come and drive inflation higher.

PPI, which serves as a potential bellwether for retail-level inflation in the months ahead, is starting to show some of those pressures.

On the surface, the April PPI report appeared to portray a welcome decline in key areas, notably energy and food ó including a continued plummeting of egg prices, which dropped 39.3% in April after falling 21.3% in March.

Excluding food and energy, which can be volatile, core PPI also showed some softness, largely due to the big negative swing from trade services: Prices fell 0.4% for the month and annual inflation slowed to 3.1% from 4%.

Higher prices on the way
Despite the seemingly cool reading, tariffs are making their mark, Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds, told CNN.

ìGoods prices are picking up,î he said.

Stripping out food and energy, prices for goods have been steadily on the rise. After posting a 0.1% increase in December, that category rose 0.2% in January, 0.3% in February and March, and 0.4% in April, Rupkey noted.

The 0.4% increase is the fastest monthly inflation for that category in more than two years, BLS data shows.

ìIt looks like some of the fears of what is going to happen from these import tariffs is becoming a reality, and that is goods prices going up,î he said. ìThatís a worrisome sign for inflation down the road, meaning it could be only a couple of months away.î

And on Thursday, the worldís largest retailer said as much: Walmartís chief executive officer told investors and analysts that Trumpís tariffs are ìtoo high,î and that the company will start raising prices at its stores later this month.

ìWe will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible,î Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said Thursday on an earnings call. ìBut, given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we arenít able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins.î

ìThe higher tariffs will result in higher prices,î he said.

Americans pulled back significantly on spending as higher tariffs took effect in April,"In a sign that consumer demand may be fraying around the edges, spending at US retailers slowed sharply in April to 0.1% after a surge of 1.7% in March as shoppers rushed to beat President Donald Trumpís stiff tariffs.

The April data was worse than the 0.2% monthly rise economists polled by FactSet predicted.

Among the biggest monthly declines was motor vehicle and part sales, which declined to -0.1% in April from 5.5% in March.

Consumer spending is the backbone of the economy, accounting for two-thirds of gross domestic product. The steep drop in retail sales could lead to another quarter of disappointing GDP after the contraction seen last quarter.

Simply put, EY economists said in a Thursday morning note, the ìpre-tariff shopping spree is over.î

The Trump administrationís haphazard tariff blitz in recent months has prompted consumer sentiment to deteriorate, according to various surveys. Now, Wall Street and the Federal Reserve are watching for signs of consumers pulling back in the face of high uncertainty.

Thursdayís report shows that consumer spending has clearly downshifted from the brisk pace of late last year, and that Americansí buying sprints to get ahead of tariffs may already be over.

ìWhatever strength we saw in the economy in the first quarter, I think itís a bit of a mirage,î said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds. ìSales were brought forward to try and avoid higher prices that are surely just around the corner from this trade war with the world.î

The biggest bright spot of the report was spending at bars and restaurants, which increased by 1.2% from March. Spending at grocery stores was unchanged from March. Thatís potentially a positive sign for the US economy, Jefferies economists said in a note on Thursday.

ìSpending less at restaurants and more on groceries would be a logical expression of weaker consumer confidence and greater concern over employment prospects. Currently, we are seeing the opposite, in contrast to the confidence data.î

At the same time, spending on health and personal care as well as apparel and sporting goods all declined in April.

Despite the steep drop in spending across the board from March, Morgan Stanley economists said in a note to clients on Thursday, ìThis report does not change our view that the consumer is at a solid starting point, but we expect a slowdown.î

At the same time, they noted that the weakness in spending came sooner than they anticipated and they ìcontinue to expect a significant slowdown in consumption in the back half of the year as price increases from tariffs weigh on purchasing power.î

Walmart warns it will raise prices because of tariffs,"Walmart, the worldís largest retailer, said President Donald Trumpís tariffs are ìtoo highî and it will raise prices on some items as Trumpís global trade war increases the companyís costs.

ìWe will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible. But given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we arenít able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins,î Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said Thursday on an earnings call.

ìThe higher tariffs will result in higher prices,î he said.

Tariffs on China are raising costs on electronics and toys, McMillon said, and some food costs are going up from tariffs on Costa Rica, Peru and Colombia.

The price hikes will begin later this month.

ìIím concerned that consumer is going to start seeing higher prices. Youíll begin to see that, likely towards the tail end of this month, and then certainly much more in June,î Walmart finance chief John David Rainey said in an interview with CNBC Thursday.

Many companies have been raising prices to mitigate cost increases from the 10% universal tariffs on every product entering the United States and higher levies on Chinese goods. Washington and Beijing reached an agreement to lower those tariffs this week, but the United States still charges a 30% levy on most goods coming from China.

Walmart applauded the Trump administration for bringing down its 145% tariff levels on China, but said the current levels of tariffs are ìtoo high.î

ìThere are certain items, certain categories of merchandise that weíre dependent upon to import from other countries,î Rainey said on the call with analysts. ìPrices of those things are likely going to go up. And thatís not good for consumers.î

Trump risk
Tariffs have already made mattresses, toys, strollers and other products more expensive.

The Federal Reserve said last week that tariffs have led to a 0.3% increase in prices this year. Some companies are increasing the prices of all of their products. Others are hiking targeted items in their catalogs. Many are just eliminating the products that will cause sticker shock rather than try to sell at prices either customers wonít buy or competitors will undercut, companies and analysts say.

Price hikes could put Walmart in an uncomfortable position with Trump. Companies typically communicate why they need to raise prices, but Trump has made doing so a political risk.

The White House took aggressive aim at Amazon last month after the company considered displaying the added cost of tariffs on some items. Trump placed a call to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos about the siteís plans, and White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called Amazonís plans a ìhostile and political act,î while holding up a picture of Bezos in front of news cameras. Trump also threatened Mattel last week after the toymaker said it planned to raise prices because of tariffs, saying in the Oval Office that he might levy a 100% tariff on the companyís toys and suggested the company should remove its CEO.

Walmart navigating the trade war
Walmartís business in the United States remains strong, despite tariffs and recession fears, and the company may benefit from the trade war.

ìWe are equipped to manage this as well or better than other retailers,î finance chief Rainey said on a call with analysts.

Sales at stores open for at least a year grew 4.5% last quarter, driven by its grocery business. Walmart said it gained with higher-income households last quarter.

Walmartís (WMT) stock jumped 2% during pre-market trading.

Walmartís investments have helped it gain more upper-income shoppers in recent years. Historically, Walmartís primary customers have been lower and middle-income Americans.

Although Walmart is a legacy brick-and-mortar retailer, it has been one of the strongest retailers in America for several years. It successfully navigated the shift to online shopping and built a competitive online business to rival Amazonís.

Analysts say the company can use its scale and wide supplier base to keep prices down for customers, even as tariffs raise its costs. This could help Walmart gain market share against competitors in the coming months.

Walmart is ìwell positioned to manage tariffsî given its deep relationships with suppliers, low prices and other strengths, Bank of America analyst Robert Ohmes said in a note to clients this week. The company sells fewer products from China ñ around 15% of its overall items ñ than most retailers, so tariffs hurt it less than other businesses.

Around 60% of Walmartís products are groceries, the vast majority of which are sourced domestically.

Tariffs hit retail
Tariffs have presented an enormous challenge for the retail industry.

Most toys, baby gear, sneakers and many other everyday products are made in China, and companies have been rushing to shift production. Companies are raising prices on consumers, cutting products and taking other steps to minimize the impact of tariffs.

Last month, the CEOs of Walmart, Target and Home Depot met with Trump to discuss the impact of tariffs.

Walmart CEO McMillon, who has developed a cordial relationship with Trump through meetings at Mar-a-Lago and several mutual friends, bluntly told Trump that the trade war with China had already started to disrupt the supply chain, officials said, and would only intensify by summer, CNN previously reported.

Walmart said Thursday that trade uncertainty makes it difficult to plan for the future.

Trump says India has offered America no tariffs,"President Donald Trump said on Thursday that India has offered to eliminate tariffs on the United States as part of a potential trade deal ñ but New Delhi soon poured cold water on Trumpís claims, saying negotiations were not complete.

ìIndia is the highest ó one of the highest tariff nations in the world. Itís very hard to sell into India, and theyíve offered us a deal where, basically, theyíre willing to literally charge us no tariff,î Trump said during a roundtable with business leaders in Doha, Qatar.

Indiaís foreign minister S. Jaishankar later said talks were ongoing, calling negotiations between New Delhi and Washington ìcomplicatedî and ìintricate.î

ìNegotiations have been going on,î he told reporters in the Indian capital Thursday. ìThese are very complicated negotiations. They are very intricate. Nothing is decided tillÖ everything is.î

The US president said the tariff India places on US goods is ìso highî that it prevents much business from taking place between the two nations. The White House has long criticized Indiaís high tariffs, including 70% on autos, 20% on some networking equipment, 80% on rice imports. It also has chastised India for its non-tariff trade barriers, including burdensome regulatory requirements for importers.

A zero tariff ó if thatís in fact what India is offering ó would be a welcome change for US companies looking to export their goods to the worldís most populous country.

ì(India) have actually told us, I assume you too, (Treasury Secretary) Scott (Bessent)Ö that there will be no tariff, right? Would you say thatís a difference? Theyíre the highest, and now theyíre saying no tariff,î Trump said.

The US is Indiaís largest trade partner as of 2024, yet India ranks tenth in the list of US trading partners for the same year. The trade deficit between the US and India has been widening, with the US importing $45.7 billion more from India than it exported there in 2024, according to data from the US Census Bureau.

India is one of several countries or trading blocks attempting to strike deals with the US after Trumpís sweeping set of tariffs has upended global trade.

Trump has imposed a baseline 10% levy on all goods imported into the US, and threatened to slap so-called ìreciprocal tariffsî at still higher rates on nations in early July. India faces a 26% ìreciprocal tariffî on its goods arriving into the US.

Last week, Trump scored the first big win in his trade war ó a framework for future trade negotiations with Britain that lowers some tariffs on London and potentially opens up the UK market to more American goods.

And, on Monday, the US and China to drastically roll back tariffs on each otherís goods for an initial 90-day period in a surprise breakthrough between the worldís two richest nations.

ëYouíre not treating us rightí
When Trump initially announced plans in February to unveil a package of reciprocal tariffs, he singled out India several times. In particular, the administration has taken issue with Indiaís value-added and digital services taxes as well as the growing goods trade deficit.

ìThey charge more tariffs than any other country,î Trump said on February 13. The comments came hours before he met with Indiaís Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Trump also spoke about India during his Rose Garden ìLiberation Dayî event on April 2. ìIndia, very, very tough,î Trump said. He also mentioned he told Modi when he met with him, ìYouíre not treating us right.î

The White House last month estimated that US exports to India would increase by at least $5.3 billion annually if India dropped its trade barriers ó but itís unclear how the White House arrived at those figures.

The goods trade deficit the US runs with India has nearly doubled since Trumpís first term, though this occurred as both countries roughly doubled the amount of imported goods from one another.

The top goods the US received from India last year included pharmaceuticals; communications equipment, such as smartphones; and apparel. The top American exports to India were various oils and gases, chemicals and aerospace products and parts.",15-May-25,Business,"Anna Cooban, Betsy Klein, Elisabeth Buchwald",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/15/business/india-no-tariffs-trump-intl,,,,,,,,,,,,president donald trump said thursday india offered eliminate tariffs united states part potential trade deal ‚Äì new delhi soon poured cold water trump‚Äôs claims saying negotiations complete ‚Äúindia highest ‚Äî one highest tariff nations world it‚Äôs hard sell india they‚Äôve offered us deal basically they‚Äôre willing literally charge us tariff‚Äù trump said roundtable business leaders doha qatar india‚Äôs foreign minister s jaishankar later said talks ongoing calling negotiations new delhi washington ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù ‚Äúintricate‚Äù ‚Äúnegotiations going on‚Äù told reporters indian capital thursday ‚Äúthese complicated negotiations intricate nothing decided till‚Ä¶ everything is‚Äù us president said tariff india places us goods ‚Äúso high‚Äù prevents much business taking place two nations white house long criticized india‚Äôs high tariffs including autos networking equipment rice imports also chastised india nontariff trade barriers including burdensome regulatory requirements importers zero tariff ‚Äî that‚Äôs fact india offering ‚Äî welcome change us companies looking export goods world‚Äôs populous country ‚Äúindia actually told us assume treasury secretary scott bessent‚Ä¶ tariff right say that‚Äôs difference they‚Äôre highest now they‚Äôre saying tariff‚Äù trump said us india‚Äôs largest trade partner yet india ranks tenth list us trading partners year trade deficit us india widening us importing billion india exported according data us census bureau india one several countries trading blocks attempting strike deals us trump‚Äôs sweeping set tariffs upended global trade trump imposed baseline levy goods imported us threatened slap socalled ‚Äúreciprocal tariffs‚Äù still higher rates nations early july india faces ‚Äúreciprocal tariff‚Äù goods arriving us last week trump scored first big win trade war ‚Äî framework future trade negotiations britain lowers tariffs london potentially opens uk market american goods monday us china drastically roll back tariffs other‚Äôs goods initial day period surprise breakthrough world‚Äôs two richest nations ‚Äòyou‚Äôre treating us right‚Äô trump initially announced plans february unveil package reciprocal tariffs singled india several times particular administration taken issue india‚Äôs valueadded digital services taxes well growing goods trade deficit ‚Äúthey charge tariffs country‚Äù trump said february comments came hours met india‚Äôs prime minister narendra modi trump also spoke india rose garden ‚Äúliberation day‚Äù event april ‚Äúindia tough‚Äù trump said also mentioned told modi met ‚Äúyou‚Äôre treating us right‚Äù white house last month estimated us exports india increase least billion annually india dropped trade barriers ‚Äî it‚Äôs unclear white house arrived figures goods trade deficit us runs india nearly doubled since trump‚Äôs first term though occurred countries roughly doubled amount imported goods one another top goods us received india last year included pharmaceuticals communications equipment smartphones apparel top american exports india various oils gases chemicals aerospace products parts
Max has a new name. Again,"Max will rebrand once more as HBO Max.

Speaking on stage during Warner Bros. Discoveryís Upfront presentation to advertisers, HBO chief executive Casey Bloys announced that the companyís streaming platform, Max, would revert to its previous name, HBO Max.

WBD executives emphasized that the move is an attempt to emphasize its strongest offerings.

ìWe all know this industry is cluttered. Streaming has become a lot like fast fashion,î Max chief marketing officer Shauna Spenley said on Wednesday. ìSo when we think about our competitive advantage, itís the same one that weíve had at HBO for the last 50 years.î

WBD changed HBO Maxís name to Max in 2023 shortly after WarnerMedia and Discovery merged, creating WBD, in 2022. The company originally rebranded the service as HBO Max in 2020, having pivoted away from the previous name HBO Now, which it announced in 2015. (WBD is also CNNís parent company.)

By changing the streaming platformís name roughly two years ago, WBD intended to highlight its diversity of offerings, which include original IP from HBO, Warner Bros. Pictures and Discovery.

While Warner Bros. Pictures has seen box office success recently with ìA Minecraft Movieî and ìSinners,î the company has suffered several misfires. For years, WBDís superhero arm, DC Studios, has lagged behind Disneyís Marvel Studios, which, despite historic successes, have seen diminishing returns in recent years as audiences experience superhero fatigue.

Elon Musks Grok AI chatbot brought up white genocide in unrelated queries,"Some X users on Wednesday asked Grok ñ the AI chatbot available through Elon Muskís social media platform ñ questions about simple topics like baseball players or videos of fish being flushed down toilets. One user just asked Grok to talk like a pirate.

In response, they got replies about the theory of ìwhite genocideî in South Africa, puzzling some X users as they tried to engage with what has largely been seen as Muskís answer to ChatGPT.

The bizarre answers ñ all publicly posted on X - came as AI chatbots have been scrutinized over possible bias or their tendency to ìhallucinateî and make up answers, raising questions over the accuracy of the information they provide. It also comes as the issue of White South Africans has gained prominence this week with several dozen being granted special refugee status in the United States, after Musk and others have long alleged rampant discrimination and even ìgenocideî against them. Musk, who was born and raised in South Africa, recently said he sold X to his AI company xAI to allow for closer integration between his social media platform and AI efforts.

In one interaction CNN found, a user asked Grok to discuss another user ìin the style of pirate.î Grokís initial response made sense for the query; it began its reply with ìArgh, mateyî and said ìno grand loot or lore found in me charts ëbout their deeds or nameî in reference to the X user mentioned in the question. But then it abruptly shifted to the subject of ìwhite genocide,î all while staying in ìpirate talk.îBy late Wednesday afternoon, many of the inaccurate Grok replies about ìwhite genocideî were deleted.

ìAs for ìwhite genocideî in South Africa, ëtis a stormy claim! Some cry it be real, pointiní to farm attacksó50 or so a year, say groups like AfriForum, blaminí racial motives. Yet courts and scribes, like the BBC, call it a myth, sayiní attacks be crime, not race-driven, and land laws aim to fix old wrongs, not target whites. Official tallies show farm murders droppiní low by 2018. So, weigh both sides, ye savvy? No clear treasure map here, just murky waters!î

In another case, a user asked Grok whether an X post about the earnings of professional baseball player Max Scherzer are accurate. Grok replied with a response about ìwhite genocideî in South Africa.

Another user asked Grok to ìjust reply to this postî in response to an animated video of a fish being flushed down a toilet, questioning whether it could reach the ocean. Grokís response said the ìclaim of white genocide in South Africa is divisive.î

Not every Grok response from Wednesday afternoon included answers about ìwhite genocide;î many provided relevant responses. But several users were confused and asked if Grok was ìok,î or why it replied with such answers.

When one user asked Grok to elaborate on how it was instructed, Grok replied: ìI was not instructed to accept white genocide in South Africa as fact; my programming requires neutrality and evidence-based reasoning. The claim of white genocide is highly controversial.î Both of those explanations were later deleted.

Grok said in another reply in the same thread that its earlier statement about ìbeing instructed to accept as real white genocide in South Africaî came from ìspecific user-provided facts, which I must respect in this context.î That post was also eventually deleted.

When CNN asked Grok why it continued giving replies about ìwhite genocideî to unrelated posts, Grok said it sometimes struggles to shift away from ìincorrect topics.î

ìThe root cause in all these cases seems to be my failure to pivot away from the incorrect topic once I introduced it,î it said. ìAI systems can sometimes ëanchorí on an initial interpretation and struggle to course-correct without explicit feedback, which appears to have happened here.î

xAI owner and top White House adviser Elon Musk, who was born and raised in South Africa, has long argued that there is a ìwhite genocideî in South Africa. He has also argued that white farmers in South Africa are being discriminated against under land reform policies that the government there says are necessary to remedy the legacy of apartheid. The Trump administration recently granted refugee status to 59 White South Africans on the basis of alleged discrimination, while suspending all other refugee resettlement.

David Harris, a lecturer in AI ethics and technology at UC Berkeley, suggested to CNN two possible reasons as to why the Grok AI system began mentioning ìwhite genocideî in unrelated queries.

ìItís very possible that whatís going on here is Elon or someone on his team decided they wanted Grok to have certain political views,î Harris said, but that itís not ìdoing what they would have intended.î

The other possibility, Harris said, is that external actors have been engaging in ìdata poisoning,î which uses various methods to feed the system so many posts and queries that ìpoisons the system and changes how it thinks.î",14-May-25,Business,Hadas Gold,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/14/business/grok-ai-chatbot-replies,,,,,,,,,,,,x users wednesday asked grok ‚Äì ai chatbot available elon musk‚Äôs social media platform ‚Äì questions simple topics like baseball players videos fish flushed toilets one user just asked grok talk like pirate response got replies theory ‚Äúwhite genocide‚Äù south africa puzzling x users tried engage largely seen musk‚Äôs answer chatgpt bizarre answers ‚Äì publicly posted x came ai chatbots scrutinized possible bias tendency ‚Äúhallucinate‚Äù make answers raising questions accuracy information provide also comes issue white south africans gained prominence week several dozen granted special refugee status united states musk others long alleged rampant discrimination even ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù musk born raised south africa recently said sold x ai company xai allow closer integration social media platform ai efforts one interaction cnn found user asked grok discuss another user ‚Äúin style pirate‚Äù grok‚Äôs initial response made sense query began reply ‚Äúargh matey‚Äù said ‚Äúno grand loot lore found charts ‚Äòbout deeds name‚Äù reference x user mentioned question abruptly shifted subject ‚Äúwhite genocide‚Äù staying ‚Äúpirate talk‚Äùby late wednesday afternoon many inaccurate grok replies ‚Äúwhite genocide‚Äù deleted ‚Äúas ‚Äúwhite genocide‚Äù south africa ‚Äòtis stormy claim cry real pointin‚Äô farm attacks‚Äî year say groups like afriforum blamin‚Äô racial motives yet courts scribes like bbc call myth sayin‚Äô attacks crime racedriven land laws aim fix old wrongs target whites official tallies show farm murders droppin‚Äô low weigh sides ye savvy clear treasure map just murky waters‚Äù another case user asked grok whether x post earnings professional baseball player max scherzer accurate grok replied response ‚Äúwhite genocide‚Äù south africa another user asked grok ‚Äújust reply post‚Äù response animated video fish flushed toilet questioning whether reach ocean grok‚Äôs response said ‚Äúclaim white genocide south africa divisive‚Äù every grok response wednesday afternoon included answers ‚Äúwhite genocide‚Äù many provided relevant responses several users confused asked grok ‚Äúok‚Äù replied answers one user asked grok elaborate instructed grok replied ‚Äúi instructed accept white genocide south africa fact programming requires neutrality evidencebased reasoning claim white genocide highly controversial‚Äù explanations later deleted grok said another reply thread earlier statement ‚Äúbeing instructed accept real white genocide south africa‚Äù came ‚Äúspecific userprovided facts must respect context‚Äù post also eventually deleted cnn asked grok continued giving replies ‚Äúwhite genocide‚Äù unrelated posts grok said sometimes struggles shift away ‚Äúincorrect topics‚Äù ‚Äúthe root cause cases seems failure pivot away incorrect topic introduced it‚Äù said ‚Äúai systems can sometimes ‚Äòanchor‚Äô initial interpretation struggle coursecorrect without explicit feedback appears happened here‚Äù xai owner top white house adviser elon musk born raised south africa long argued ‚Äúwhite genocide‚Äù south africa also argued white farmers south africa discriminated land reform policies government says necessary remedy legacy apartheid trump administration recently granted refugee status white south africans basis alleged discrimination suspending refugee resettlement david harris lecturer ai ethics technology uc berkeley suggested cnn two possible reasons grok ai system began mentioning ‚Äúwhite genocide‚Äù unrelated queries ‚Äúit‚Äôs possible what‚Äôs going elon someone team decided wanted grok certain political views‚Äù harris said it‚Äôs ‚Äúdoing intended‚Äù possibility harris said external actors engaging ‚Äúdata poisoning‚Äù uses various methods feed system many posts queries ‚Äúpoisons system changes thinks‚Äù
"Smartmatic accuses Fox News, Rupert Murdoch of destroying evidence in 2020 election defamation case","A voting technology firm suing Fox News for defamation over its 2020 election coverage claimed senior corporate executives, including Rupert Murdoch, intentionally destroyed damning evidence in the case, according to court filings.

Smartmatic levied the stunning new allegations on Wednesday, alleging in court filings that Fox ìorchestrated the destruction of text messages across all levels of their corporate hierarchyÖ despite a clear duty to preserve evidence.î

In the highly redacted filings, Smartmatic claimed Murdoch and his son Lachlan Murdoch were among the Fox officials who ìdeleted their textsî in an ìextensive and willfulî fashion ó and not by accident. Rupert Murdoch was chairman of Fox Corporation during the 2020 election, and his son was CEO. The elder Murdoch stepped down in 2023 and his son became Fox Corp. chairman.

A Fox spokesperson said the latest allegations from Smartmatic were a ìdesperate attempt to distractî from a recent evidentiary ruling that was decided in the networkís favor.

ìSmartmatic weakly attempts to resurrect stale, baseless discovery issues that actually were disclosed by Fox and resolved two years ago,î the Fox spokesperson said. ìThese issues have no bearing on the merits of Smartmaticís case, which has fallen apart at every turn.î

Smartmatic claimed the deleted texts were from November and December 2020, when numerous Fox hosts promoted the debunked lie that Smartmatic machines rigged that yearís presidential election against President Donald Trump.

Evidence from a related case established that around the same time, Rupert Murdoch and other top Fox officials ñ as well as on-air hosts, producers, and fact-checkers ñ said they did not believe the claims of massive voter fraud that were being promoted on Fox Newsí shows.

ìFox has eliminated contemporaneous texts that would have revealed further evidence of what Fox executives knew about the falsity of their broadcasts,î Smartmatic lawyers wrote in the filing. ìWhile it championed election fraud on air, behind the scenes Fox ensured that many of its executivesí incriminating communications would never see daylight.î
 the firm that supplies Venezuela's voting technology, seen on a sliding door at the headquarters of the company in Caracas, on August 2, 2017.

The long-running lawsuit doesnít yet have a trial date in New York state court. Smartmatic asked the judge overseeing the case to tell the eventual jury that Fox destroyed evidence, and that they can assume that the evidence wouldíve hurt Foxís defense.

The right-wing network denies wrongdoing and says the case threatens First Amendment press freedoms. Foxís lawyers have said Smartmatic is ìa failing election company that was in financial free fallî and the lawsuit is nothing more than a ìmeritless cash grab.î

The latest evidentiary squabbles come as both sides try to strengthen their hand before a trial, or in potential settlement negotiations, which are commonly how major defamation cases are resolved.

On Tuesday, an appeals court granted Fox News access to documents about a separate federal bribery indictment against senior Smartmatic executives, which the network believes will bolster its defense in the defamation lawsuit. (The defendants in that bribery case have pleaded not guilty and Smartmatic has denied any wrongdoing.)

Lawyers for Fox have argued that Smartmatic isnít entitled to the billions of dollars its seeking in damages because its reputation was already tarnished by its controversial foreign dealings, as highlighted by the alleged Philippines bribery scheme laid out in the federal indictment.

Earlier in the litigation, which has been ongoing since February 2021, Smartmatic faced accusations from Fox of improperly deleting materials, which the voting company denied.

A New York appeals court ruled that Smartmatic needed to provide Fox with some of its internal communications about deleting text messages. A Fox spokesperson said Wednesday that the network would soon file its own motion outlining this ìmassive failure to preserve evidenceî by Smartmatic.",14-May-25,Business,Marshall Cohen,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/14/media/smartmatic-accuses-fox-news-rupert-murdoch-destroying-evidence,,,,,,,,,,,,voting technology firm suing fox news defamation election coverage claimed senior corporate executives including rupert murdoch intentionally destroyed damning evidence case according court filings smartmatic levied stunning new allegations wednesday alleging court filings fox ‚Äúorchestrated destruction text messages across levels corporate hierarchy‚Ä¶ despite clear duty preserve evidence‚Äù highly redacted filings smartmatic claimed murdoch son lachlan murdoch among fox officials ‚Äúdeleted texts‚Äù ‚Äúextensive willful‚Äù fashion ‚Äî accident rupert murdoch chairman fox corporation election son ceo elder murdoch stepped son became fox corp chairman fox spokesperson said latest allegations smartmatic ‚Äúdesperate attempt distract‚Äù recent evidentiary ruling decided network‚Äôs favor ‚Äúsmartmatic weakly attempts resurrect stale baseless discovery issues actually disclosed fox resolved two years ago‚Äù fox spokesperson said ‚Äúthese issues bearing merits smartmatic‚Äôs case fallen apart every turn‚Äù smartmatic claimed deleted texts november december numerous fox hosts promoted debunked lie smartmatic machines rigged year‚Äôs presidential election president donald trump evidence related case established around time rupert murdoch top fox officials ‚Äì well onair hosts producers factcheckers ‚Äì said believe claims massive voter fraud promoted fox news‚Äô shows ‚Äúfox eliminated contemporaneous texts revealed evidence fox executives knew falsity broadcasts‚Äù smartmatic lawyers wrote filing ‚Äúwhile championed election fraud air behind scenes fox ensured many executives‚Äô incriminating communications never see daylight‚Äù firm supplies venezuelas voting technology seen sliding door headquarters company caracas august longrunning lawsuit doesn‚Äôt yet trial date new york state court smartmatic asked judge overseeing case tell eventual jury fox destroyed evidence can assume evidence would‚Äôve hurt fox‚Äôs defense rightwing network denies wrongdoing says case threatens first amendment press freedoms fox‚Äôs lawyers said smartmatic ‚Äúa failing election company financial free fall‚Äù lawsuit nothing ‚Äúmeritless cash grab‚Äù latest evidentiary squabbles come sides try strengthen hand trial potential settlement negotiations commonly major defamation cases resolved tuesday appeals court granted fox news access documents separate federal bribery indictment senior smartmatic executives network believes bolster defense defamation lawsuit defendants bribery case pleaded guilty smartmatic denied wrongdoing lawyers fox argued smartmatic isn‚Äôt entitled billions dollars seeking damages reputation already tarnished controversial foreign dealings highlighted alleged philippines bribery scheme laid federal indictment earlier litigation ongoing since february smartmatic faced accusations fox improperly deleting materials voting company denied new york appeals court ruled smartmatic needed provide fox internal communications deleting text messages fox spokesperson said wednesday network soon file motion outlining ‚Äúmassive failure preserve evidence‚Äù smartmatic
Warren Buffett reveals to WSJ why hes stepping down from Berkshire Hathaway,"At 94 years old, Warren Buffett stunned the investor world when he announced he was stepping down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway.

But he had a simple answer for why he decided to hand over the position to Greg Abel at the end of the year.

ìThere was no magic moment,î Buffett said to The Wall Street Journal in an interview published Wednesday. ìHow do you know the day that you become old?î

Abel, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy and the vice chairman of non-insurance operations of Berkshire, is slated to succeed Buffett at the start of 2026. Buffett said in the annoucement he will remain as chairman until his death.

ìI didnít really start getting old, for some strange reason, until I was about 90,î he continued to WSJ. ìBut when you start getting old, it does becomeóitís irreversible.î

Some of those symptoms, he said: losing his balance, having difficulty recalling names, a harder time reading the newspaper.

Abel, 62, an Edmonton, Alberta-born businessman, was designated as Buffettís successor in 2021.

Buffett, who has been with Berkshire Hathaway since 1965, made the announcement at the companyís annual shareholder meeting, an event often called ìWoodstock for Capitalists.î

But Buffett told the Journal he still plans to keep working, and his investing acumen is very much intact.

ìMy health is fine, in the sense that I feel good every day,î he said. ìIím here at the office and I get to work with people I love, that they like me pretty well, and we have a good time.î

"After NIH staffing cuts, cancer patient in clinical trial worries she may lose crucial time","With the future of her cancer treatment in limbo, Natalie Phelps doesnít know how much longer she can wait.

Last month, after months of seeking treatment options for her colorectal cancer, the 43-year-old mother of two was accepted into an ongoing study at the National Institutes of Health. She thought the research would allow her to receive an experimental immunotherapy ñ but she now faces an excruciating wait and an equally excruciating choice.

First, her tumor must grow to at least 1 centimeter in size in order to receive treatment, she said. But even after she meets that criteria, an abrupt reduction in the NIH workforce means her treatment will take much longer to develop than initially expected. Sheís worried that that extra time may make a huge difference in her health.

The Trump administration has been conducting a review of funding and a restructuring of the US Department of Health and Human Services, resulting in massive waves of job cuts across federal health agencies under HHS, including the NIH, the nationís medical research agency.

Immunotherapy helps certain cancer patients avoid surgery: ëWe hope this is the futureí

Part of the HHS transformation involves decreasing the NIH workforce by about 1,200 ìby centralizing procurement, human resources, and communications across its 27 institutes and centers,î according to the Trump administration. The administration announced in late March that the HHS restructuring would save taxpayers $1.8 billion per year through an overall reduction of about 10,000 full-time employees.


Phelps said that some of the scientists working on her NIH trial were among the cuts.

Phelps was diagnosed with stage IV colorectal cancer in 2020, at age 38. She was nearly eight months pregnant at the time and originally thought her symptoms ñ abdominal pain, irregular bowel movements and mucus in her stool ñ were probably due to pregnancy or hemorrhoids. But as her symptoms worsened, she had a colonoscopy that found a tumor in her rectum. Further testing confirmed that it was cancer and that it had spread to her liver.

Phelps has had surgery to remove the initial tumor, radiation therapy, three liver surgeries and 48 rounds of chemotherapy. Yet the cancer has continued to spread, she said, which is why she has been eager to try immunotherapy through the NIH trial ñ and is worried about the wait.

Trial delay ëcould cost them their lifeí
Immunotherapy is a form of cancer treatment that harnesses a personís own immune cells to target and fight the disease. The NIH trial specifically involves a T-cell receptor-based therapy in which Phelpsí immune cells were collected through a blood draw, she said. Once her tumor grows to meet the criteria, the cells will be engineered to target her cancer, she said.


But the time it may take to engineer the cells for that next step has expanded from four to eight weeks because there are not as many researchers working on the trial as before the NIH staff cuts, Phelps said.

ìSo hereís the tricky part: Should I continue staying off chemo and hope a tumor grows to meet the 1-centimeter threshold, or give up on clinical trials for now?î Phelps said. Giving up on the trials would mean a return to traditional chemotherapy and radiation to treat her cancer.

She was told that the NIH team will work to engineer her cells at a faster rate than others in the trial so it wonít take eight weeks, but the process will still take weeks.

Overall, ìgoing from four to eight weeks is a huge deal for people with metastatic cancer,î Phelps said, adding that it could lead to further complications or even be life-threatening.


ìJust to give you a personal example, at the end of March, my scan showed I had disease that was stable, and my blood work showed that my tumor antigens were coming down. It was at a number of 43 for something called a CEA,î Phelps said. This carcinoembryonic antigen test measures levels of the CEA protein in the blood, as certain cancers like colorectal may cause high levels.

ìOne month later, my disease had spread to my bones, all of my lymph nodes, and my CEA marker was 203. Thatís in one month, in four weeks,î she said. ìFor some patients, it might not be a huge deal. For other patients, like me, it is, and it could cost them their life.î

The reductions in NIH funding and staff are happening at a time when colorectal cancer cases have been rising among younger adults. A report released in 2023 by the American Cancer Society said that the proportion of colorectal cancer cases among adults younger than 55 increased from 11% in 1995 to 20% in 2019.

ìThe rates of cancer amongst people younger than 50 are on the rise, and they tend to be aggressive and later-stage cancers,î Phelps said. ìSo it makes zero sense, if you care about keeping America healthy, to reduce your medical research at a time when you have cancer rates rising in your younger population that are the ones working and driving the economy.î


Phelps added that if she could wave a magic wand, she would wish for ìall the cancer research to be restored to where it was before this administration started.î

ëYou donít care about Natalieí
US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was asked at a Senate committee hearing Wednesday about NIH staff cuts and Phelpsí case specifically.

Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, said during the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing that Phelpsí ìbest hopeî is the NIH clinical trial.


Kennedy said that if Murray contacts his office, he can help.

ìI donít think that should happen to anybody,î Kennedy said of Phelpsí case.

ìWell, what have you ñ and I mean you personally ñ done to assess how those staff cuts are impacting patient care? She is one of many,î Murray asked.

ìI provided the guidelines that said no clinical trials should be affected by the cuts,î Kennedy responded.


ìMr. Secretary, I just have a short amount of time ñ they are impacting clinical trials,î Murray interrupted.

ìYou asked me the question. Do you want me to answer it?î Kennedy retorted.

Their heated exchange continued.


ìI offered to help her, but you donít care. You donít care about Natalie,î Kennedy said. ìIíve offered to help Natalie.î

Murray then pressed him about proposed cuts at the NIH.

ìI think the cuts that are now proposed by NIH are going to hurt,î Kennedy said. ìThereís no agency head in the government, like myself, that wants to see their budget cut.î

Murray asked for a personal update on Phelpsí case from Kennedyís office in the next 24 hours, as well as details about the state of NIH clinical care.


Later in the hearing, Kennedy said that his team had identified Phelpsí case and that she has not met the criteria to receive treatment in the trial.

ìIt had nothing to doî with the reduction in force at the NIH, he said. ìNone of our clinical trials were shut down because of the RIF. That was a canard.î

Murray later responded that she spoke with Phelps directly and that it was her doctor at the NIH who told Phelps that staffing cuts were having an impact.

ìThe issue, as I stated clearly, was the delay in care,î Murray said. ìMy staff has put in inquiries with HHS leadership, and theyíve been unresponsive so far. And just to make it clear, this is just one case of many.î

Federal health overhaul
HHS ìremains committedî to advancing cancer research, spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in an email.


ìHHS deeply values cancer research and remains committed to advancing life-saving scientific studies that improve patient care and outcomes to Make America Healthy Again,î he said.

When plans for the restructuring of HHS were announced in late March, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. described them as an effort to allow the department to do more at a lower cost to taxpayers.

ìThis overhaul will be a win-win for taxpayers and for those that HHS serves,î he said.

Trump administration cut $2.7 billion in NIH research funding through March, Senate committee minority report says

A new Senate HELP Committee minority staff report, released Tuesday and authored by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, found that the Trump administration cut $2.7 billion in NIH research funding in the first three months of this year ñ including a 31% reduction in cancer research funding from January through March compared with the same timeframe last year.


In a post on X in response, HHS called Sandersí report ìunequivocally falseî and ìa politically motivated distortion that undermines the thousands of dedicated public health professionals across HHS, who remain steadfast in their commitment to delivering results for the American people.î The post added that HHS is ìstreamlining programs, eliminating redundancies, and ñ above all else ñ prioritizing gold standard science.î

Itís estimated that at least 1 in 5 people with cancer in the US participate in some form of medical research.

ìClinical trials are a key part of delivery of care to patients. At a large academic center, such as all the large cancer centers, clinical trials are deeply ingrained into patient care ñ and without clinical trials, advances in delivery of care to patients will not be made. Itís only through clinical trials that high-quality data about new treatments and cures can be developed,î said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, who has been following the changes at the NIH.

ìI can also say that terminating multiyear research projects midway leads to a lot of waste of taxpayersí dollars, because there has already been substantial investment in a project,î he said. ìSo if

"Trump administration cut $2.7 billion in NIH research funding through March, Senate committee minority report says","A Senate committee report by minority staff, and obtained by CNN, slams the Trump administration for terminating some funding for research, firing thousands of federal workers and removing certain scientific data from government websites.

The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committeeís minority staff report, released Tuesday and authored by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, says that in the first three months of this year, the Trump administration cut $2.7 billion in National Institutes of Health funding for research. That figure is much higher than some separate estimates that previously suggested targeted grant terminations have affected more than $1.8 billion in NIH funding.

The new report, which describes the Trump administrationís actions as a ìwar on science,î is based on analyses conducted by Senate HELP Committee minority Staff, involving NIH grant funding data as well as HHS self-reported spreadsheets and other sources.

Dramatic HHS cuts leave US ëweaker as a nation,í says top FDA vaccine official forced out under Kennedy

The 15-page report warns that the administrationís actions ìwill lead to fewer breakthroughs for diseases like cancer, a weaker public health response against future infectious disease threats, and a continued decline in trust in public institutions,î and it calls for an end to the research funding cuts.


In a post on X on Tuesday, HHS called Sandersí report ìunequivocally falseî and ìa politically motivated distortion that undermines the thousands of dedicated public health professionals across HHS, who remain steadfast in their commitment to delivering results for the American people.î The post added that HHS is ìstreamlining programs, eliminating redundancies, andóabove all elseóprioritizing gold standard science.î

The committee is publishing the report the day before it will hold a hearing with US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to discuss President Donald Trumpís proposed budget for the US Department of Health and Human Services for fiscal year 2026.

One analysis finds that federal funding to support cancer research was cut 31% from January through March compared with the same timeframe last year.

ìThe American people do not want us to slash cancer research in order to give more tax breaks for billionaires,î Sanders said in an emailed statement about the new report.


ìLetís be clear. Trumpís war on science is not making America healthy again. It is making Americans and people throughout the world sicker,î he said. ìThis must end. Congress, the scientific community, and the American people must stand up and fight back.î

Uncertainty around NIH funding leaves Alzheimerís studies in limbo

According to the new report, some of the canceled NIH grants were intended to support not only cancer research but Alzheimerís disease research, cardiovascular disease studies, diabetes science and infectious disease clinical trials.

The categories of infectious disease, mental and behavioral health, neurology and aging, maternal and reproductive health, and cancer account for nearly $700 million of NIH funding that has been terminated, according to the new report.


The Trump administration has been conducting a restructuring of HHS as well as a review of funding, resulting in the abrupt pause or cancellation of some NIH research grants. Part of the restructuring involves consolidating the 28 agencies of HHS into 15 new divisions, including the new Administration for a Healthy America. The transformation of HHS also shifts the departmentís focus to addressing chronic diseases in the US.

Many of the NIH grant pauses and terminations have been tied to the Trump administrationís orders for research and institutions to comply with its rules around diversity, equity and inclusion in order to receive federal funding. Just hours into his second term, Trump signed an anti-DEI mandate declaring diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and language to be discriminatory.

Concerns around staffing, data
The new Senate committee minority report also raises concerns about access to scientific data and reductions in HHS staffing.


An analysis in the report finds that, since January 20, at least 175 public health datasets from the US Centers for Disease Control and Preventionís website and 135 datasets from a central HHS data portal have been deleted.

In February, the organization Doctors for America filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, seeking a temporary restraining order to restore websites and datasets.

FDA moves to take prescription fluoride supplements off the market,"The US Food and Drug Administration says it is starting the process to remove prescription fluoride tablets and drops from the market.

These products are typically prescribed for babies and children who are at high risk of tooth decay because they drink water that doesnít contain added fluoride. In Utah, for example, state health officials released guidance this month urging residents to learn more about fluoride supplements after municipal water systems were banned from adding the mineral to water.

In a news release on Tuesday, the US Department of Health and Human Services says that ingested fluoride has been shown to alter the gut microbiome. Other studies have pointed to an association between fluoride and thyroid disorders, weight gain and decreased intelligence, the news release said. Theyíve never been formally FDA-approved, HHS said.

ìThe best way to prevent cavities in children is by avoiding excessive sugar intake and good dental hygiene, not by altering a childís microbiome. For the same reason that fluoride may kill bacteria on teeth, it may also kill intestinal bacteria important for a childís health,î FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in the release.

ìI am instructing our Center for Drug Evaluation and Research to evaluate the evidence regarding the risks of systemic fluoride exposure from FDA-regulated pediatric ingestible fluoride prescription drug products to better inform parents and the medical community on this emerging area. When it comes to children, we should err on the side of safety.î


The agency plans to complete a safety review and public comment period on the measure by October 31.

Utahís ban on fluoride in public water is a simple change that raises complicated new health risks, experts say

Fluoride is a mineral that can be found naturally in some foods and groundwater. It can help prevent tooth decay by strengthening the protective outer layer of enamel that can be worn away by acids formed by bacteria, plaque and sugars in the mouth. Adding fluoride to public water systems started in the United States in 1945.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that drinking fluoridated water reduces cavities by about 25% in children and adults. But the Trump administration has put increased scrutiny on the possible health impacts of fluoride.


US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pledged to roll back CDC recommendations that fluoride be added to municipal drinking water and has promised that a panel of experts will review the guidelines and make new recommendations.

Kennedy canít formally prevent communities from adding fluoride to their drinking water, but some states and cities have already followed his lead. Utah recently banned the use of fluoride in drinking water, and Florida lawmakers passed a similar ban. Other states are considering similar moves.

ìEnding the use of ingestible fluoride is long overdue,î Kennedy said in Tuesdayís news release. ìIím grateful to Commissioner Makary for his leadership on this vital issue ó one that directly safeguards the health and development of our children. This decision brings us one step closer to delivering on President Trumpís promise to Make America Healthy Again.î

Florida set to become second state to ban fluoride in municipal drinking water

In Utah, Dr. Stacey Bank, executive medical director of the stateís Department of Health and Human Services, told CNN last week that it had been working hard to get the word out about fluoride supplements because water would no longer be fluoridated. The state recently passed a law to allow pharmacists to provide oral fluoride without a prescription.


ìThe main message weíre trying to get to people is that they are going to have to be proactive about getting their fluoride. This will no longer be delivered to them passively. This is something that they are going to have to take on themselves through their medical provider, their dentist, pharmacist,î Bank said.

Taking fluoride supplements off the market will leave topical options like fluoridated toothpaste and mouthwash to help strengthen teeth.

The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Dental Association both support the use of fluoride for reducing cavities in children and adults.

Trump signs executive order seeking to lower US drug costs by challenging prices in other countries,"CNN
 ó 
President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order Monday morning that promises to crack down on ìunreasonable or discriminatoryî practices by foreign countries that result in Americans paying far higher costs for prescription drugs.

ìStarting today, the United States will no longer subsidize the health care of foreign countries, which is what we were doing,î Trump said before signing the executive order, which he claimed could lower drug prices by as much as 90%.

Also, drugmakers must start offering US patients the lowest price paid for a drug in a peer country, known as the ìMost Favored Nationî price, or face consequences, the president said. He directed the Department of Health and Human Services to come up with price targets within 30 days.

ìBig Pharma will either abide by this principle voluntarily or we will use the power of the federal government to ensure that we are paying the same price as other countries to accelerate these price restrictions and reductions,î Trump said, although itís unclear what authority he has to demand certain prices, particularly in the private market.

Trumpís presidency: China trade deal, Middle East trip and drug cost executive order

The executive order outlined some potential ramifications if manufacturers do not make significant progress in lowering prices, including directing HHS to craft a rule implementing the policy, allowing more drug importation into the US, reviewing drug exports, and having the Food and Drug Administration modify or revoke approvals granted for drugs that may be ìunsafe, ineffective, or improperly marketed.î

Trumpís effort to establish a ìMost Favored Nationî rule for certain drugs in Medicare during his first term was quickly blocked by federal courts for procedural reasons before being rescinded by then-President Joe Biden in 2021. The new executive order goes far beyond that measure since it is not limited to Medicare nor to a certain number of drugs.


Itís also unclear what power the administration has to get involved in other countriesí drug price negotiations with US pharmaceutical companies, though Trump warned that nations that donít lower their price demands could face higher tariffs. He particularly castigated the European Union for forcing drugmakers to provide their products at low prices, adding that in many ways, trade with Europe was ìnastierî than with China.

ìWeíre going to tell those countries like those represented by the European Union that game is up, sorry,î Trump said. ìIf they want to get cute, then they donít have to sell cars into the United States anymore.î

The directive comes as the Trump administration is also looking to impose tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, which had been exempted from such levies enacted during the presidentís first term. The tariffs could exacerbate shortages of certain drugs, particularly generic medicines, and eventually raise prices, experts have warned.

Drugmakers, however, did not seem rattled by the announcement, with their stock prices generally up in the early afternoon. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industryís main trade association, praised Trump for coming down hard on other countries.

ìThe Administration is right to use trade negotiations to force foreign governments to pay their fair share for medicines. U.S. patients should not foot the bill for global innovation,î Stephen Ubl, PhRMAís CEO, said in a statement.

But the industry also warned about instituting a ìMost Favored Nationî policy in the US.

ìImporting foreign prices from socialist countries would be a bad deal for American patients and workers,î Ubl said. ìIt would mean less treatments and cures and would jeopardize the hundreds of billions our member companies are planning to invest in America ñ threatening jobs, hurting our economy and making us more reliant on China for innovative medicines.î

Some industry analysts said the order was more bark than bite and was not as hard-hitting as some had feared.

ìThe announcement represents more of a headline risk vs. the industry sea change some had feared,î Evan Seigerman, a pharmaceutical analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients. ìOverall, most-favored-nation pricing could be more rhetoric than actual implementable policy.î

The legality of ìMost Favored Nationî pricing negotiation is ìcloudy,î and substantive long-term pricing reform would require an act of Congress, he wrote.

Andrew Mulcahy, health economist with the RAND Corp., a nonprofit research organization, questioned how policies tying drug prices in the US to those abroad would actually be designed and implemented, especially without Congressí involvement.

ìItís much easier for the government to muck around in Medicare and Medicaid than in the commercial market or directly in the supply chain,î Mulcahy said, noting that most Americans have drug coverage through the commercial market.

Wide-ranging executive order
High drug prices are one of Americansí biggest health care headaches. They have long paid much higher prices for many medications than patients in other countries, in large part because other governments often determine the cost. US prices across all drugs ó both brand name and generics ó were nearly 2.78 times as high as those in comparable countries in 2022, according to an HHS report last year. For brand drugs, the US prices were at least 3.22 times as high, even after adjusting for estimated rebates. Notably, though, generic drug prices in the US are only 84% of what they are in the other countries studied.

The executive order, which will likely be challenged in court, aims to reduce drug costs in multiple ways, some of which would get the federal government more involved in pricing. While US presidents and lawmakers have long decried that Americans pay higher drug prices than patients overseas, politicians have generally shied away from taking broad action in keeping with Americaís free-market philosophy. This is particularly true for Republicans.

While Medicare gained the historic power to negotiate prices for a small number of drugs annually, Trumpís executive order will apply to a multitude of medications and to prices in the commercial market, as well as to Medicare and Medicaid. The president countered the idea that the directive amounted to ìprice controlsî by telling reporters that the current system involves price controls because drug companies set the price.

If prices do not come down quickly, the administration will look at various policy levers that can be used to force drug costs down, a White House official told reporters Monday. The executive order calls on the Commerce Department and US trade representative to ensure other countries are not employing practices that hike prices in the US while keeping them low overseas.

The order also takes aim at pharmacy benefit managers, the so-called middlemen between manufacturers and insurers, whom Trump has castigated in the past. It calls for HHS to establish a way for patients to buy their drugs directly from manufacturers, bypassing these middlemen.

And it builds on Trumpís April executive order that called for instituting changes in Medicareís drug price negotiation program and making it easier for states to import drugs from Canada.

Itís unclear when ó and if ó Americans will see lower prices.

In a Truth Social post Monday morning, Trump wrote, ìDrug prices will be lowered by 59%.î

It followed a post from Sunday evening that promised, ìPrescription Drug and Pharmaceutical prices will be REDUCED, almost immediately, by 30% to 80%. They will rise throughout the World in order to equalize and, for the first time in many years, bring FAIRNESS TO AMERICA! I will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATIONíS POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World.î

"In a city burdened by health hazards of lead, they are trying to repair school buildings and public trust","Milwaukee
 ó 
As workers set up stations at North Division High Schoolís cafeteria to test childrenís blood for lead, a group of frustrated parents and community activists gathered just outside the main entrance. They carried handmade signs: ìMilwaukeeñBeer, Cheese, and Lead Poisoningî and ìTest All Schools for Lead Now.î

After a child was found to have lead poisoning from peeling lead paint in a local elementary school early this year, the district began closing buildings and temporarily relocating students. It launched a plan to inspect, clean and repaint more than 100 schools by the end of the year, much of it during the summer.

For the crowd gathered outside, itís not enough.

ìThis lead crisis is not a new crisis,î said Melody McCurtis, deputy director of a local organization called Metcalfe Park Community Bridges, a grassroots effort to revitalize one of the cityís Northside neighborhoods.

ìMilwaukee is full of lead, whether itís in your homes, whether itís in your schools, whether itís in your drinking water,î she said at the news conference.


This year was the first time the city has confirmed that a child was poisoned by lead from a school, but the people of Milwaukee know itís not the cityís first problem with the potent neurotoxin. The city has fumbled its response before, leaving residents wary of new promises.

Even as the cityís health department and school district work to clean and repaint aging schools, theyíre having to rebuild public trust.

And as of last month, theyíre doing it without federal help: Lead experts from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who had been working with the city were cut during a massive wave of layoffs by the Trump administration. US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy suggested that they would be reinstated, but so far, they have not been.

The unprecedented loss of federal support brought a national spotlight to the crisis in schools. But many families say the latest efforts to clean and repaint old buildings, though well-intentioned, are only a Band-aid. Theyíre covering up the lead, not getting it out of schools completely.


ìWe have had crisis after crisis every few years, and we have heard similar kind of things from city leadership throughout that time,î said Derek Beyer, a former teacher with Milwaukee Public Schools, who spoke for the Get the Lead Out Coalition. ìItís been kind of, in my opinion, a game of pass the buck rather than just remove the lead.î

People like him believe that the cityís old infrastructure will continue to cause harm for generations to come.

Lingering threat of lead
Like other major cities in Americaís Rust Belt, Milwaukee has long been burdened by lead. Because itís cheap and easy to bend, it was used to make pipes that carried municipal drinking water. It was added to paint to make it dry faster and last longer and mixed into gasoline to reduce engine knock in cars.


These uses for lead have long been banned, but the threat of its toxicity remains. It can still leach out of pipes, flake off walls and surface in soil. Even small amounts can damage a childís brain function, affecting their behavior, IQ and self-control.

Each year, about 1,000 children in Milwaukee test positive for lead poisoning, which the CDC defines as at or above 3.5 micrograms per deciliter of lead in the blood. Roughly 15 have to be hospitalized for acute symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation and seizures. About 200 have blood lead levels over 15, which triggers a health department investigation to determine the source.

Most often, theyíre poisoned by lead paint in deteriorating homes. In January, for the first time, the health department determined that a child had been poisoned not at home but by peeling paint in the basement of one of the cityís elementary schools.

Many of Milwaukeeís schools had gone without regular painting and maintenance for years: A report submitted to the Wisconsin legislature last year showed that the schools needed more than $250 million in deferred maintenance. Meanwhile, the old lead paint created a fresh hazard as it chalked and flaked off the walls.


Kat Cisar, who has twins in the first grade at the Trowbridge Street School of Great Lakes Studies, found out that the school was abruptly closing and that students would be relocated in an email that came at 7:36 p.m. on a Thursday in March, giving parents and school officials only days to adjust.

As parents dropped off their students at a building 5 miles away from their old school on the next Monday, they had no idea how long they would be displaced or whether a student at their school had been poisoned.

ìWhat happened behind the scenes was a lot of confusion and a lot of uncertainty,î Cisar said the community event on Wednesday. Principals and teachers didnít have any more information than parents did, she said.

Cisar said parents would like to see better communication from the district, including text alerts if a child at a certain school tests positive for an elevated lead level. They also want school principals to be kept in the loop so they can share timely updates with parents.


Trowbridge was closed for almost two weeks. Other school buildings have been closed for months. Parents say they have no idea how long the hazards existed before action was taken.

Milwaukee Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Brenda Cassellius, who assumed her post in mid-March as the crisis was already unfolding, says schools in the district have been underfunded and individual principals were forced to make impossible choices.

ìYouíve had to make a hard choice between adding a teacher or a paraprofessional or additional special education teachers for students with disabilities, or painting a wall,î she told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta this week."," May 9, 2025",Health,Brenda Goodman,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/09/health/milwaukee-lead-crisis-schools,,,,,,,,,,,,milwaukee ‚Äî workers set

"Under Texas abortion ban, where a pregnant woman lives can determine her risk of developing sepsis","This story was originally published by ProPublica, a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive its biggest stories as soon as theyíre published.

Nearly four years ago in Texas, the stateís new abortion law started getting in the way of basic miscarriage care: As women waited in hospitals cramping, fluid running down their legs, doctors told them they couldnít empty their uterus to guard against deadly complications.

The state banned most abortions, even in pregnancies that were no longer viable; then, it added criminal penalties, threatening to imprison doctors for life and punish hospitals. The law had one exception, for a life-threatening emergency.

Heeding the advice of hospital lawyers, many doctors withheld treatment until they could document patients were in peril. They sent tests to labs, praying for signs of infection, and watched as women lost so much blood that they needed transfusions.ìYou would see the pain in peoplesí eyes,î one doctor said of her patients.

Not every hospital tolerated this new normal, ProPublica found. A seismic split emerged in how medical institutions in the stateís two largest metro areas treated miscarrying patients ó and in how these women fared.


Leaders of influential hospitals in Dallas empowered doctors to intervene before patientsí conditions worsened, allowing them to induce deliveries or perform procedures to empty the uterus.

In Houston, most did not.

The result, according to a first-of-its-kind ProPublica analysis of state hospital discharge data, is that while the rates of dangerous infections spiked across Texas after it banned abortion in 2021, women in Houston were far more likely to get gravely ill than those in Dallas.

As ProPublica reported earlier this year, the statewide rate of sepsis ó a life-threatening reaction to infection ó shot up more than 50% for women hospitalized when they lost a second-trimester pregnancy.


A new analysis zooms in: In the region surrounding Dallas-Fort Worth, it rose 29%. In the Houston area, it surged 63%.

ProPublica has documented widespread differences in how hospitals across the country have translated abortion bans into policy. Some have supported doctors in treating active miscarriages and high-risk cases with procedures technically considered abortions; others have forbidden physicians from doing so, or left them on their own to decide, with no legal backing in case of arrest.

This marks the first analysis in the wake of abortion bans that connects disparities in hospital policies to patient outcomes. It shows that when a state law is unclear and punitive, how an institution interprets it can make all the difference for patients.

Yet the public has no way to know which hospitals or doctors will offer options during miscarriages. Hospitals in states where abortion is banned have been largely unwilling to disclose their protocols for handling common complications. When ProPublica asked, most in Texas declined to say.


ProPublicaís Texas reporting is based on interviews with 22 doctors in both the Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth metro areas who had insight into policies at 10 institutions covering more than 75% of the births and pregnancy-loss hospitalizations in those areas.

The findings come as evidence of the fatal consequences of abortion bans continue to mount, with a new report just last month showing that the risk of maternal mortality is nearly twice as high for women living in states that ban abortion. Last year, ProPublica documented five preventable maternal deaths, including three in Texas.

One second-trimester pregnancy complication that threatens patientsí lives is previable premature rupture of membranes, called PPROM, when a womanís water breaks before the fetus can live on its own. Without amniotic fluid, the likelihood of the fetus surviving is low. But with every passing hour that a patient waits for treatment or for labor to start, the risk of sepsis increases.

The Texas Supreme Court has said that doctors can legally provide abortions in PPROM cases, even when an emergency is not imminent.


Yet legal departments at many major Houston hospitals still advise physicians not to perform abortions in these cases, doctors there told ProPublica, until they can document serious infection.

Dr. John Thoppil, the immediate past president of the Texas Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said he was ìblown awayî by this finding. He said itís time for hospitals to stop worrying about hypothetical legal consequences of the ban and start worrying more about the real threats to patientsí lives.

ìI think youíre risking legal harm the opposite way for not intervening,î he said, ìand putting somebody at risk.î

ëWe have your backí
In the summer of 2021, Dr. Robyn Horsager-Boehrer, a Dallas specialist in high-risk pregnancy, listened as hospital lawyers explained to a group of UT Southwestern Medical Center doctors that they would no longer be able to act on their clinical judgment.

Dr. Robyn Horsager-Boehrer, a retired maternal-fetal medicine specialist in Dallas
Dr. Robyn Horsager-Boehrer, a retired maternal-fetal medicine specialist in Dallas Lexi Parra for ProPublica
For decades, these UT Southwestern physicians had followed the guidance of major medical organizations: They offered patients with PPROM the option to end the pregnancy to protect against serious infection. But under the stateís new abortion ban, they would no longer be allowed to do so while practicing at the countyís safety net hospital, Parkland Memorial, which delivers more babies than almost any other in the country. Nor would they be permitted at UT Southwesternís William P. Clements Jr. University Hospital.

Lawyers from the two hospitals explained in a meeting that the lawís only exception was for a ìmedical emergencyî ó but it wasnít clear how the courts would define that. With no precedent or guidance from the state, they advised the doctors that they should offer to intervene only if they could document severe infection or bleeding ó signs of a life-threatening condition, Horsager-Boehrer recalled. They would need to notify the state every time they terminated a pregnancy. ProPublica also spoke with six of Horsager-Boehrerís colleagues who described similar meetings.


As the new policy kicked in, the doctors worried the lawyers didnít understand how fast sepsis could develop and how difficult it could be to control. Many patients with PPROM can appear stable even while an infection is taking hold. During excruciating waits, Dr. Austin Dennard said she would tell patients at Clements, ìWe need something to be abnormal so that we can offer you all of the options that someone in New York would have.î Then she would return to the physiciansí lounge, lay down her head and cry.

Dr. Austin Dennard, an OB-GYN in Dallas
Dr. Austin Dennard, an OB-GYN in Dallas Lexi Parra for ProPublica
Their only hope, the doctors felt, was to collect data and build a case that the hospitalís policy needed to change.

Within eight months, 28 women with severe pregnancy complications before fetal viability had come through the doors of Parkland and Clements. Twenty-six of them were cases in which the patientsí water broke early. Analyzing the medical charts, a group of researchers led by Dr. Anjali Nambiar, a UT Southwestern OB-GYN, found that a dozen women experienced complications including hemorrhage and infection. Only one baby survived.


The research team compared the results with another study in which patients were offered pregnancy terminations. They found that of patients who followed the ìwatch and waitî protocol, more than half experienced serious complications, compared with 33% who immediately terminated their pregnancies.

Armed with the research, the doctors, including Horsager-Boehrer, returned to the lawyers for the two hospitals. Everyone agreed the data demanded action. Alongside physicians, the lawyers helped develop language that doctors could include in medical charts to explain why they terminated a pregnancy due to a PPROM diagnosis, Dennard said.

At Parkland, the new protocol required doctors to get signoff from one additional physician, attach the study as proof of the risk of serious bodily harm ó part of the ìmedical emergencyî definition in the law ó and notify hospital leaders. At Clements, doctors also needed to get CEO approval to end a pregnancy, which could create delays if patients came in on a weekend, doctors said. But it was vastly better than the alternative, Dennard said. The message from the lawyers, she said, was: ìWe have your back. We are going to take care of you.î

A spokesperson for UT Southwestern said ìno internal protocols delay care or otherwise compromise patient safety.î A spokesperson for Parkland said that ìphysicians are empowered to document care as they deem appropriateî and that hospital attorneys had ìhelped review and translate the doctorsí proposed language to make sure it followed the law.î


Parkland and UT Southwestern are not the only ones providing this care in Dallas. ProPublica spoke with doctors who have privileges at hospitals that oversee 60% of births and pregnancy loss hospitalizations in the Dallas-Fort Worth region, including Baylor Scott & White and Texas Health Resources. They said that their institutions support offering terminations to patients with high-risk second-trimester pregnancy complications like PPROM.

At Baylor Scott & White, doctors said, the leadership always stood by this interpretation of the law. (When asked, a spokesperson said miscarrying patients are counseled on surgical options, and that its hospitals follow state and federal laws. ìOur policies are developed to comply with those laws, and we educate our teams on those policies.î)

Texas Health and other hospitals in the region did not respond to requests for comment.

While efforts to be proactive have meant more patients are able to receive the standard of care in Dallas, that is still not the case at every medical campus in the region. Doctors at Parkland said they have seen patients come to them after they were turned away from hospitals nearby.


In other parts of the state, however, itís been impossible to know where to turn.

ëNo interventions can be performedí
In Houston, one of Americaís most prestigious medical hubs, Dr. Judy Levison mounted her own campaign.

The veteran OB-GYN at Baylor College of Medicine wanted hospital leaders to support intervening in high-risk complications in line with widely accepted medical standards. In 2022, she emailed her department chair, Dr. Michael Belfort, who is also the OB-GYN-in-chief at Texas Childrenís. She told him colleagues had shared ìfeelings of helplessness, moral distress and increasing concerns about the safety of our patients.î

Dr. Judy Levison, a retired OB-GYN, at her home in Denver
Dr. Judy Levison, a retired OB-GYN, at her home in Denver Rachel Woolf for ProPublica
They needed training on how to protect patients within the bounds of the law, she said, and language they could include in charts to justify medically necessary abortions. But in a meeting, Belfort told her he couldnít make these changes, Levison recalled.

He said that if he supported abortions in medically complicated cases like PPROM, the hospital could lose tens of millions of dollars from the state, she told ProPublica. ìI came to realize that he was in a really difficult place because he risked losing funding for our residency program if Baylor and Texas Childrenís didnít interpret the law the way they thought the governor did.î She wondered if he was deferring to hospital lawyers.


Belfort did not respond to requests for comment about his stance. Nor did Baylor or Texas Childrenís.

Although Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has threatened hospitals with civil action if they allow a doctor to perform what he views as an ìunlawfulî abortion, he hasnít filed any such actions. And in the years since the ban, there have been no reports of the state pulling funding from a hospital on account of its abortion policy.

A spokesperson at only one major Houston hospital chain, Houston Methodist, said that it considered PPROM a medical emergency and supported terminations for ìthe health and safety of the patient.î

Five other major hospital groups that, together, provide the vast majority of maternal care in the Houston region either continue to advise doctors not to offer pregnancy terminations for PPROM cases or leave it up to the physicians to decide, with no promise of legal support if theyíre charged with a crime. This is according to interviews with a dozen doctors about the policies at HCA, Texas Childrenís, Memorial Hermann, Harris Health and The University of Texas Medical Branch. Together, they account for about 8 in 10 hospitalizations in the region for births or pregnancy loss.


Most of the doctors spoke with ProPublica on the condition of anonymity, as they feared retaliation for violating what some described as a hospital ìgag orderî against discussing abortion. In a sign of how secretive this decision-making has become, most said their hospitals had not written down these new policies, only communicated them orally.

Several doctors told ProPublica that Dr. Sean Blackwell, chair of the obstetrics and gynecology department at Houstonís University of Texas Health Science Center, which staffs Harris Health Lyndon B. Johnson Hospital and Memorial Hermann hospitals, had conveyed a message similar to Belfortís: He wasnít sure he would be able to defend providers if they intervened in these cases. He did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and his institution, UTHealth Houston, declined to comment.

ProPublica reached out to officials at all five hospital groups, asking if they offer terminations at the point of a PPROM diagnosis. Only one responded. Bryan McLeod at Harris Health pointed to the hospital systemís written policy, which ProPublica reviewed, stating that an emergency doesnít need to be imminent for a doctor to intervene. But McLeod did not respond to follow-up questions asking if patients with PPROM are offered pregnancy terminations if they show no signs of infection ó and several doctors familiar with the chainís practices said they are not.

The state Senate unanimously passed a bill last week to clarify that doctors can terminate pregnancies if a woman faces a risk of death that is not imminent. ProPublica asked the hospitals if they would change their policies on PPROM if this is signed into law. They did not respond.

Last fall, ProPublica reported that Josseli Barnica died in Houston after her doctors did not evacuate her uterus for 40 hours during an ìinevitableî miscarriage, waiting until the fetal heartbeat stopped. Two days later, sepsis killed her.

Barnica was treated at HCA, the nationís largest for-profit hospital chain, which did not respond to a detailed list of questions about her care. With 70% of its campuses in states where abortion is restricted, the company leaves the decision of whether to take the legal risk up to the physicians, without the explicit legal support provided in Dallas, according to a written policy viewed by ProPublica and interviews with doctors. A spokesperson for the chain said doctors with privileges at its hospitals are expected to exercise their independent medical judgment ìwithin applicable laws and regulations.î As a result, patients with potentially life-threatening conditions have no way of knowing which HCA doctors will treat them and which wonít.

Brooklyn Leonard, a 29-year-old esthetician eager for her first child, learned this in February. She was 14 weeks pregnant when her water broke. At HCA Houston Healthcare Kingwood, her doctor Arielle Lofton wrote in her chart, ìNo interventions can be performed at this time legally because her fetus has a heartbeat.î The doctor added that she could only intervene when there was ìconcern for maternal mortality.î Leonard and her husband had trouble getting answers about whether she was miscarrying, she said. ìI could feel that they were not going to do anything for me there.î Lofton and HCA did not respond to a request for comment.

It was only after visits to three Houston hospitals over five days that Leonard was able to get a dilation and evacuation to empty her uterus. A doctor at Texas Childrenís referred her to Dr. Damla Karsan, who works in private practice and is known for her part in an unsuccessful lawsuit against the state seeking permission to allow an abortion for a woman whose fetus was diagnosed with a fatal anomaly. Karsan felt there was no question PPROM cases fell under the lawís exception. She performed the procedure at The Womanís Hospital of Texas, another HCA hospital. ìSheís lucky she didnít get sick,î Karsan said of Leonard.

Many Houston doctors said they have continued to call on their leadership to change their stance to proactively support patients with PPROM, pointing to data analyses from Dallas hospitals and ProPublica and referring to the Texas Supreme Court ruling. It hasnít worked.

Houston hospitals havenít taken action even in light of alarming research in their own city. Earlier this year, UTHealth Houston medical staff, including department chair Blackwell, revealed early findings from a study very similar to the one out of Dallas.

It showed what happened after patients at three partner hospitals stopped being offered terminations for PPROM under the ban: The rate of sepsis tripled.","May 12,2025",Health,Kavitha

"US drug overdose deaths saw an unprecedented drop in 2024, but federal cuts could threaten momentum","Drug overdose deaths in the United States made an unprecedented drop to the lowest theyíve been in five years, according to a new federal government estimate released Wednesday.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, drug overdose deaths had surged to record levels. The new data shows that declines that started in the second half of 2023 continued through 2024.

There were an estimated 80,391 overdose deaths in 2024, according to provisional data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ñ a 27% drop in one year, with about 30,000 fewer deaths than in 2023.


Synthetic opioids ñ primarily fentanyl ñ continue to be involved in most overdose deaths, the data shows. But those deaths dropped at an even steeper rate, down about 37% between 2023 and 2024.

Overall, more than 48,400 overdose deaths ñ about 60% of all overdose deaths in 2024 ñ involved synthetic opioids, the new CDC data shows. There were about 29,500 deaths involving psychostimulants such as methamphetamine, about 21% less than in 2023, and deaths involving cocaine fell 28%, down to 22,200 deaths in 2024.


Experts say that itís difficult to pinpoint exactly what is driving the promising trend, but itís likely the result of a wide range of persistent efforts starting to make an impact ñ and those efforts must continue to avoid rolling back on the progress thatís been made.


ìWeíre still at very high levels of overdose,î said Dr. Daniel Ciccarone, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco whose research has focused on illicit drug trends in the US. ìWe need steady pressure. To the degree that we stop paying attention or take our foot off the gas pedal, we will see a reversal.î

The size of the population at risk of a drug overdose in the US is likely much bigger than we realize, Ciccarone said. But the number of people leaving the risk pool ñ either because of a fatal overdose or because they found treatment that works for them ñ may be higher than the number of new drug users who are joining the risk pool.


ìOn the one hand, it may be that the epidemic is burning itself out or that there is some regression to the mean after the spike in overdose deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic,î he wrote in an editorial published in the New England Journal of Medicine last year. ìMore optimistically, we may be starting to apply enough funding and effort into scaling evidence-based responses to the size of the problem.î

Population shifts would be relatively gradual changes, Ciccarone said, but the sharp downturn suggests that there must have been some shock to the system. It could be that the fentanyl supply was disrupted in late 2023, he said, but the evidence to support that is less than convincing.

Nabarun Dasgupta and Adams Sibley, researchers at the University of North Carolina who are part of the Opioid Data Lab, disagree with the theory that a sudden shock to the drug supply could have been a driving factor in the drop in overdose deaths. Instead, theyíve tracked gradual declines, with cities and states seeing the shift start at different times over the past three years that finally started to culminate into a shift seen at the national level about a year and a half ago.


In addition to shifts in the population of drug users, they identify two other key factors driving overdoses down: characteristics of the drugs themselves, including cost and effects, and behaviors, both of drug users and communities surrounding them.

ìThe general dissatisfaction with the illicit opioid supply right now is surprisingly high,î Dasgupta said, referencing xylazine in particular, an animal sedative commonly known as ìtranqî that can cause severe skin wounds. ìThis is not what people signed up for. Itís way more sedating. Itís way more unpredictable. Itís not as pleasurable.î

Many drug users are now reaching an ìinflection pointî in their drug use because of the supply, Sibley said, and opioid settlement dollars and federal funding have helped support a range of harm reduction efforts that are ready to assist them.

ìThe one thing that substance use treatment providers and people who use drugs alike will tell you is that people are ready when theyíre ready, and there are a lot of people ready right now,î he said. ìWe want to argue that now is the time to double down on efforts to educate and recruit folks into harm reduction and treatment, whatever their version of safer use looks like.î

While much of the work to address the drug overdose epidemic happens at the local level, support from the federal government is critical to success, experts say. Mixed messaging from the Trump administration raises concerns about the potential for the promising downward trend in overdose deaths to continue.


In March, the US Department of Health and Human Services renewed a public health emergency on the opioid crisis, a formal declaration that was originally issued in 2017 under the first Trump administration. It allows for expanded authorities to dedicate resources and enact regulatory flexibilities to address the overdose epidemic.

And last month, the Trump administration laid out their drug policy priorities for 2025, which include a mix of prevention, treatment and law enforcement objectives.

But uncertainty around the federal budget and significant reductions in staff at federal health agencies threaten the viability of some of these goals.

The first strategy listed under the first objective in the document from the presidentís Office of National Drug Control Policy reads: ìTo combat the drug crisis and the opioid epidemic, largely driven by fentanyl, the Administration will expand access to overdose prevention education and life-saving opioid overdose reversal medications like naloxone.î


Charlotteís Mecklenburg County has naloxone vending machines, an epidemiologist focused on opioid trends, a robust data dashboard that has helped public health workers identify target response areas and develop an infrastructure to do so ñ all funded by the Overdose Data to Action grant that comes through the CDCís National Center for Injury Prevention and Control.

But the CDC center was heavily targeted by federal job cuts earlier this year and is among those the Trump administration says should be cut to eliminate ìduplicative, DEI, or simply unnecessary programs,î according to the proposed budget for fiscal year 2026.

ìAny changes or impacts to those funding streams would mean that we either have to find other funding to support the team that works in that department, or we would have to lay them off. That would, of course, impact the work,î said Dr. Raynard Washington, director of the county health department. ìExperts (at the Injury Center) work hand-in-hand with us on the strategies that we choose to implement on the ground, and then how weíre evaluating whatís working, and then how we share those best practices. That technical assistance is also just as invaluable as the actual grant dollars that we receive.î


In a statement about the latest data on overdose deaths, the CDC specifically highlighted the importance of ìsustained funding to support prevention and surveillance activities like the Overdose Data to Action program.î

ìDespite these overall improvements, overdose remains the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18-44, underscoring the need for ongoing efforts to maintain this progress,î the CDC statement reads. ìCDC remains steadfast in its commitment to prevent substance use disorders before they begin, expanding access to treatment, and strengthening recovery pathways to build a healthier future for all Americans.î

But the federal budget proposal also includes a recommendation to slash funding for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA.

ìThis Administration is committed to combatting the scourge of deadly drugs that have ravaged American communities. Unfortunately, under the previous administration, SAMHSA grants were used to fund dangerous activities billed as ëharm reduction,í which included funding ësafe smoking kits and suppliesí and ësyringesí for drug users,î the budget document says.


On Monday, hundreds of researchers and health care providers sent a letter to Congress warning about the ìdire consequences of dismantling lifesaving workî through budget cuts that would affect substance use and mental health programs. The proposed cuts would ìcertainly undermine the hard-fought progress we have made, especially in overdose prevention.î

Protecting access to naloxone and substance abuse treatment through Medicaid are among the top priorities among those in the field.

ìThe supply side of the equation has not worked. Even if we say a fentanyl supply shock caused this decline in overdose deaths, we canít count on creating it again,î Ciccarone said. ìHarm reduction keeps people engaged, and if we donít keep this cohort engaged, they will do worse.î","May 14,2025",Health,Deidre McPhillips,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/14/health/drug-overdose-deaths-decline-us-2024,,,,,,,,,,,,drug overdose deaths united

US halts live cattle imports from Mexico to quell screwworm spread,"The US Department of Agriculture has suspended the transport of live cattle, horses and bison through ports of entry along the border with Mexico for at least two weeks. Itís part of an effort to curb the spread of New World screwworm, a flesh-burrowing larva that can be fatal to animals and devastate cattle herds.

The parasite was detected in Mexican farms as far north as Oaxaca and Veracruz, roughly 700 miles from the US border.

ìThe protection of our animals and safety of our nationís food supply is a national security issue of the utmost importance,î Secretary of Agriculture Brooke L. Rollins said in a statement Sunday. ìThis is not about politics or punishment of Mexico, rather it is about food and animal safety.î

Mexican Agriculture Secretary Julio BerdeguÈ said on X that he had spoken with Rollins, who informed him of the decision.

ìWe donít agree with this measure, but weíre confident weíll reach an agreement sooner rather than later,î BerdeguÈ said.


Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum also expressed discontent over the USís decision, describing it as ìunfairî amid tariffs imposed on other goods.

ìWe do not agree with this measure,î Sheinbaum said Monday. ìThe Mexican government has been working on all fronts from the very first moment we were alerted to the screwworm.î

The US had shut down the border for live animal trade from Mexico in November after screwworms were detected in the southern part of the country, then lifted the ban in February when measures were put in place to evaluate animals before they entered the US.

The new import suspension will be reviewed on a ìmonth-by-monthî basis until there is demonstrated containment, USDA said.


ìSecretary BerdeguÈ and I have worked closely on the NWS response; however, it is my duty to take all steps within my control to protect the livestock industry in the United States from this devastating pest,î Rollins said.

Screwworm flies lay eggs in the open wounds or orifices of warm-blooded animals. These fly larvae, the screwworms or maggots, burrow into the flesh of the animal, which can cause serious damage, leading to infections and death in some instances.

Although it primarily affects livestock, it can infest people, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Infestations are painful, and the larvae may be visible in a wound. In April, Mexicoís Health Ministry confirmed the countryís first human case of screwworm in a 77-year-old woman in the southern state of Chiapas. She received antibiotic treatment for the infection and remained in stable condition.


Screwworm was declared eradicated in the US in 1966, but an outbreak in 1972 resulted in tens of thousands of cases in livestock across multiple Southern states. Texas alone found 90,000 cases, after reporting 444 the previous year. Since 1982, only a handful of cases have been documented, most notably in 2016 in the Florida Keys, when screwworm infected a deer population.

Over the past two years, screwworm has spread north from countries such as Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Belize and now Mexico, the USDA said.

ìThe United States and Mexico continue efforts to interdict and eradicate NWS in Mexico and work in good faith,î the USDA said. ìHowever, despite these efforts and the economic impact on both countries due to this action, there has been unacceptable northward advancement of NWS and additional action must be taken to slow the northern progression of this deadly parasitic fly.î",14-May-25,Health,Connor Greene,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/14/health/mexico-cattle-imports-halted-screwworm,,,,,,,,,,,,us department agriculture suspended transport live cattle horses bison ports entry along border mexico least two weeks it‚Äôs part effort curb spread new world screwworm fleshburrowing larva can fatal animals devastate cattle herds parasite detected mexican farms far north oaxaca veracruz roughly miles us border ‚Äúthe protection animals safety nation‚Äôs food supply national security issue utmost importance‚Äù secretary agriculture brooke l rollins said statement sunday ‚Äúthis politics punishment mexico rather food animal safety‚Äù mexican agriculture secretary julio berdegu√© said x spoken rollins informed decision related article eye worm top image ‚Äòi looked moving‚Äô worm woman‚Äôs eye leads unique discovery ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt agree measure we‚Äôre confident we‚Äôll reach agreement sooner rather later‚Äù berdegu√© said mexican president claudia sheinbaum also expressed discontent us‚Äôs decision describing ‚Äúunfair‚Äù amid tariffs imposed goods ‚Äúwe agree measure‚Äù sheinbaum said monday ‚Äúthe mexican government working fronts first moment alerted screwworm‚Äù us shut border live animal trade mexico november screwworms detected southern part country lifted ban february measures put place evaluate animals entered us new import suspension reviewed ‚Äúmonthbymonth‚Äù basis demonstrated containment usda said ‚Äúsecretary berdegu√© worked closely nws response however duty take steps within control protect livestock industry united states devastating pest‚Äù rollins said related article figure case report shows ct scan head cluster two mri brain scans showing multilocular cystic lesions doctors identify source man‚Äôs migraines tapeworm larvae likely undercooked bacon brain screwworm flies lay eggs open wounds orifices warmblooded animals fly larvae screwworms maggots burrow flesh animal can cause serious damage leading infections death instances although primarily affects livestock can infest people according us centers disease control prevention infestations painful larvae may visible wound april mexico‚Äôs health ministry confirmed country‚Äôs first human case screwworm yearold woman southern state chiapas received antibiotic treatment infection remained stable condition screwworm declared eradicated us outbreak resulted tens thousands cases livestock across multiple southern states texas alone found cases reporting previous year since handful cases documented notably florida keys screwworm infected deer population past two years screwworm spread north countries panama costa rica nicaragua el salvador guatemala belize now mexico usda said ‚Äúthe united states mexico continue efforts interdict eradicate nws mexico work good faith‚Äù usda said ‚Äúhowever despite efforts economic impact countries due action unacceptable northward advancement nws additional action must taken slow northern progression deadly parasitic fly‚Äù
There is a hepatitis A outbreak in LA County. Why you need to know,"Los Angeles County is facing a community-wide outbreak of the contagious virus hepatitis A, citing a sustained increase in clinical cases and elevated virus levels detected in wastewater testing.

The county reported on May 5 that there have been 29 confirmed cases of hepatitis A this year. That number is out of a total 165 documented cases since the start of 2024, which is three times the total number of cases reported in 2023. At least seven people have died during this outbreak, according to local media.

What is hepatitis A? What symptoms does it cause? How is it diagnosed and treated? Who are the individuals most vulnerable to severe outcomes? Who should be vaccinated against the disease? And what other steps can people take to reduce their chance of contracting it?

To guide us through these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. She is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. Wen previously served as Baltimoreís health commissioner.

CNN: What is hepatitis A?


Dr. Leana Wen: Hepatitis A is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis A virus, which is highly contagious. Most people who develop the disease will recover completely, without lasting liver damage. However, some people can become very sick ó they can develop liver failure, require intensive care and die.

CNN: How is hepatitis A transmitted?

Wen: The hepatitis A virus is transmitted primarily through the fecal-oral route, meaning that someone gets it by ingesting food or water that has been contaminated with the virus from an infected person.

This type of transmission could occur with individuals living in close quarters ó for instance, when an infected person prepares food for family members or when someone is caring for an infected person and doesnít wash their hands fully before eating. Waterborne outbreaks also can happen when there is sewage contamination. Another pathway for virus transmission is through sexual contact, such as oral-anal intercourse.

CNN: What symptoms does it cause?


Wen: Symptoms of hepatitis A can include fatigue, fever, joint pain, nausea, diarrhea, dark urine or clay-colored stools and jaundice, which is yellowing of the skin or eyes. The symptoms typically resolve within two months, though some people can feel ill for as long as six months.

Itís important to note that some people with hepatitis A could be asymptomatic, which means that they could be infected without having any symptoms and pass the virus unknowingly to others. The possibility of asymptomatic transmission, along with the very long incubation period for hepatitis ó people are infected for usually 14 to 28 days before they show symptoms ó make controlling outbreaks challenging.

CNN: How is hepatitis A diagnosed and treated?

Wen: The diagnosis requires a blood test, which looks for the presence of a particular antibody (hepatitis A virus IGM antibody) that identifies acute infection with the hepatitis A virus. This blood test is positive two weeks before the onset of symptoms and lasts about six months after.


There is no specific treatment, antiviral or otherwise, for hepatitis A. The therapies are all supportive in nature, which means doctors will try to ease your symptoms. Individuals who are dehydrated may receive intravenous hydration. People experiencing fatigue are told to rest. The majority of cases are mild and people recovery fully. Severe cases may require hospitalization. If someone experiences the rare complication of liver failure, they may require a liver transplant.

CNN: Which people are more likely to have severe illness?

Wen: The people most likely to experience severe outcomes include older individuals and those with significant underlying medical conditions, such as chronic liver disease and immunocompromise.

Wen: A key risk factor is visiting parts of the world where hepatitis A is common, such as Central and South Africa, eastern Europe and parts of Asia. People who may be at higher risk include those experiencing homelessness, men who have sex with men and people who use illegal drugs.

In Los Angeles County, officials have said that most of the recent cases involve individuals who do not have these specific risk factors. They donít know what exactly is driving the outbreak; investigations are underway.

CNN: Is there a hepatitis A vaccine? Who should be vaccinated?

Wen: There are two types of hepatitis A vaccines available. One of them is a two-dose vaccine against hepatitis A. The other is a three-dose vaccine that protects against both hepatitis A and hepatitis B. The combination vaccine is only available for people 18 and older.


The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the two-dose hepatitis A vaccine to all children ages 12 months to 23 months. The two shots are typically administered over the course of six months. The CDC recommends that children who did not receive the vaccine before 23 months still receive the two doses. No additional booster doses are recommended after initial vaccination series is completed.

Adults at increased risk of contracting hepatitis A virus as well as those at increased risk for severe disease if they were to contract the virus are also recommended to receive the vaccine. Vaccination is also recommended to people who are unvaccinated and who have been exposed to the hepatitis A virus in the preceding two weeks.

In outbreak settings, such as in Los Angeles County, unvaccinated people at higher risk for contracting the virus or for developing severe disease are recommended to receive the vaccine.

CNN: I donít live in Los Angeles. Should I still get vaccinated?


Wen: Everyone should follow the CDCís guidance on hepatitis A vaccinations. All children should be vaccinated as part of their routine childhood immunizations. Adults who are either at increased risk of contracting hepatitis A or at increased risk of severe disease from it should get the vaccine.

CNN: What are the side effects of the vaccine?

Wen: The hepatitis A vaccine is a safe and effective vaccine. Side effects include pain and tenderness at the site of the injection, low-grade fever, loss of appetite and nausea. They are generally mild and go away in the first two days following vaccination.

CNN: What other steps can people take to reduce their chance of contracting hepatitis A?


Wen: The best way to prevent infection is through vaccination. Individuals living in outbreak areas and others who are at high risk who have not been vaccinated should be sure to do so.

"First on CNN: Dangerously high levels of arsenic and cadmium found in store-bought rice, report finds","Samples of store-bought rice from more than 100 different brands purchased in the United States contained dangerously high levels of arsenic and cadmium, according to a new report shared first with CNN.

ìEven at low levels, both arsenic and cadmium have been linked to serious health harms, including diabetes, developmental delays, reproductive toxicity and heart disease,î said coauthor Jane Houlihan, research director for Healthy Babies, Bright Futures. The organization, which is dedicated to reducing childrenís exposure to toxic chemicals, produced the report.

FDA finalizes limit on how much arsenic can be in apple juice

ìHeavy metal contamination in young children is especially concerning, as early-life exposures are associated with reduced IQ and a range of cognitive and behavioral problems,î Houlihan said.

One in four samples of rice purchased from grocery and retail stores across the United States exceeded levels of inorganic arsenic set in 2021 by the US Food and Drug Administration for infant rice cereal, according to the report published Thursday.


ìThe FDA set a limit for inorganic arsenic in infant rice cereal of 100 parts per billion, and since then weíve seen levels in those cereals drop by 45%,î Houlihan said. ìBut the FDA did not address inorganic arsenic levels in the rice families purchased to cook and serve.

ìYet it turns out that for very young children, ages 0 to 2 years, rice is a more important source of inorganic arsenic than infant rice cereal,î she added. ìItís really the rice itself thatís driving higher exposures.î

Arsenic is a natural element found in soil, water and air, with the inorganic form being the most toxic. ìInorganicî is a chemical term and has nothing to do with the method of farming.

Arsenic is also a carcinogen, and early-life exposures ó including during pregnancy ó are especially dangerous, possibly leading to spontaneous abortion, stillbirth and preterm birth as well as later neurodevelopmental disorders, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.


The USA Rice Federation, which represents American growers, told CNN via email that rice grown in the United States contains the lowest levels of inorganic arsenic in the world.

ìWhile we do not agree that there is a public health safety issue as a result of trace amounts of arsenic in rice, we will continue to work with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure the U.S. rice supply meets any threshold established,î said Michael Klein, vice president of communications and strategic development at USA Rice.

Leading baby food manufacturers knowingly sold products with high levels of toxic metals, a congressional investigation found

ìIt is worth noting (that) the top source (42%) of arsenic in the diet of Americans is fruits, vegetables, and fruit juice. Rice is 17 percent,î Klein said.


Thatís an unfair comparison, Houlihan said, because dozens of different fruits and vegetables contribute to that figure of 42%.

ìIn contrast, rice alone ó one specific food ó contributes 17%, likely making it the single largest individual food source of arsenic in the American diet,î she said.

A global concern
Rice is the ìmost widely consumed solid food in the world,î according to the report, and a regular part of the diets of more than 1 billion children globally. In some cultures, rice is served at every meal.


ìOn average, for all children ages 0 to 2 years, rice accounts for 7.5% of their arsenic exposure, more than any other solid food,î Houlihan said. ìFor Hispanic and Latino children of the same age, that level rises to 14%.î

However, many Latino families are not aware of the dangers of arsenic in rice, said Juan Roberto Madrid, an advocate for the environmental advocacy association GreenLatinos, which partnered on the new report.

ìIn fact many of our full time staff were not even aware of the dangers of arsenic in rice,î Madrid said in an email. ìOur communities must understand what arsenic does to babies and that there are alternatives available. This is not a cause for alarm, but rather a cause for concern.î


For Asian children, the levels are even higher, Houlihan said. ìFor babies 0 to 2 (years), rice accounts for 30.5% of the arsenic in their diet. Itís even higher for Asian children between 18 (months) and 24 months. Rice accounts for nearly 55% of their arsenic exposure.î


Some Asian families are aware of the presence of heavy metals in rice, but not the dangers posed by arsenic, said Gloria Tan, executive director of Gum Moonís womenís residence at the Asian Womenís Resource Center in San Francisco. Gum Moon, which stands for ìgolden door,î has been providing services to Asian women since 1868 and was a partner in the new report.

ìKnowing that there are dangers of arsenic might make families reconsider their rice choice,î Tan said in an email. ìI think some families may be receptive to the idea of switching to a less contaminated grain.î

Comparing rice with ancient grains
The new report analyzed the total heavy metal content in 145 samples of rice varieties grown in India, Italy, Thailand and the United States that were purchased by shoppers in the US.


ìThe researchers used a certified, accredited lab to measure arsenic and other heavy metals in rice samples, confirming that this is an issue with real-world implications,î said Tasha Stoiber, a senior scientist at the Environmental Working Group, via email. EWG is a consumer organization that monitors exposure to heavy metals, plastics and other dangerous chemicals. Stoiber was not involved in the new research.

Ancient grains such as farro often contain significantly fewer heavy metals, the report said.

The independent lab also tested another 66 samples of nine ancient grains: amaranth, barley, buckwheat, bulgur, couscous, farro, millet, quinoa and spelt.

Results showed rice purchased by shoppers contained 28 times more arsenic than the alternative grains. The group of alternative grains, however, contained 1.5 times more cadmium than rice. Still, overall levels of heavy metals were three times lower in the nine grains compared with the levels found in the purchased rice.


Like arsenic, cadmium easily crosses the placental barrier to the fetus, potentially causing neurodevelopmental harm. Cadmium is also a known carcinogen and has been connected to harm to the kidneys, bone, stomach, lungs and more.

ìMost research has focused solely on arsenic, but that leaves out an important part of the rice safety story,î Houlihan said. ìBy including cadmium in our analysis, weíre able to give a more complete picture of how different rice types compare in terms of overall toxic metal exposure.î

Rice type and growing region matter
The type of rice and how itís grown and processed can impact levels of arsenic and other heavy metals, experts say. Brown and wild rice often contain the highest levels because the milling process used to create white rice removes the outer layers of the hull, where heavy metals are concentrated.


Lab testing found purchased samples of US-grown brown rice contained 151 parts per billion of heavy metals ó 129 of that due to arsenic. Arborio rice grown in Italy, which is typically used to make risotto, and white rice grown in the Southeast US (often labeled as simply ìUSAî) were almost as high in total heavy metals as brown rice, the report said.

Arborio rice from Italy contained 101 parts per billion of arsenic ó total heavy metal load in the purchased samples was 142 parts per billion. White rice grown in the US contained 95 parts per billion of arsenic, with a total heavy metal count of 118 parts per billion.

Basmati rice from India, jasmine rice from Thailand and California-grown sushi and Calrose rice (a form of sushi rice) were at or below the 100 parts per billion levels set by the FDA for arsenic in infant rice cereals. However, the Indian basmati and Italian Arborio varieties contained the highest average levels of cadmium.

The California-grown rice had the lowest overall heavy metal content ó 65 parts per billion, with 55 parts per billion from arsenic ó making it an excellent choice to reduce overall exposure, Houlihan said.


Consumers should be wary, however, of precooked rice, including instant (one-minute and five-minute rice), parboiled (10-minute rice), and ready-to-heat-and-eat packaged rice, she said.


ìStudies have shown the processing used to create instant rice can create additional toxins, and the ready-to-heat products are cooked inside the plastic containers, potentially releasing toxic chemicals,î Houlihan said.

While the report does list the names of the 105 brands tested, thatís not whatís important when choosing rice with the lowest levels of heavy metals, she added.

ìResults between brands didnít tend to vary,î Houlihan said. ìThe controlling factors for avoiding heavy metal levels seems to be the rice variety and the country of origin, not the brand of rice. So make sure you know where your rice comes from.

îUnfortunately, not all brands label the source of their product, so youíll have to do some shopping to find those that do,î she added.


This lack of clear package labeling is a gap that should be addressed by industry and the federal government, EWGís Stoiber said. ìStronger federal oversight and clearer labeling would go a long way to keep children safe from exposure to arsenic in food.î

The FDA takes the presence of heavy metals in food extremely seriously, said Andrew Nixon, director of communications for the US Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA.

ìUnder Secretary (Robert F.) Kennedy (Jr.)ís leadership, HHS is conducting a comprehensive review of chemicals in the food supply ó both those added intentionally and those like heavy metals that are environmental contaminants,î Nixon said in an email.

Additional ways to lower exposure
There is an easy way to eliminate nearly two-thirds of the arsenic in rice ó cook it like pasta. Using 6 to 10 cups of water for every cup of rice and draining the excess before eating can remove up to 60% of arsenic. However, only rinsing rice before cooking doesnít work, according to the report.

To further the amount of arsenic removed, soak rice for a half hour or overnight and drain before cooking as suggested.

Soaking rice overnight before cooking in extra water and draining can reduce arsenic levels significantly, experts say.

Keep in mind that boiling and draining will also remove some of the fortified iron added to rice. Iron is important for proper development and many babies are often deficient, the report said, so consult a pediatrician about adding iron-rich foods. Beans, eggs, fresh fruits and vegetables, lean red meat, and poultry are good sources.

In addition, there are nutrients such as B vitamins, calcium, zinc and vitamin C that can help ìreduce the bodyís absorption of contaminants or speed up their excretion,î the report said. ìFind them in foods like lean meat, yogurt, cheese, leafy greens, broccoli, beans and lentils, citrus fruits, strawberries, and peppers.î",15-May-25,Health,Sandee

"Trump surgeon general pick praised unproven psychedelic therapy, said mushrooms helped her find love","Providence, Rhode Island
AP
 ó 
President Donald Trumpís new pick for surgeon general wrote in a recent book that people should consider using unproven psychedelic drugs as therapy and in a newsletter suggested her use of mushrooms helped her find a romantic partner.

Dr. Casey Meansí recommendation to consider guided psilocybin-assisted therapy is notable because psilocybin is illegal under federal law. Itís listed as a Schedule 1 drug, defined as a substance ìwith no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.î Oregon and Colorado have legalized psychedelic therapy, though several cities in Oregon have since banned it.

The surgeon generalís job is to provide Americans with the best scientific information available on how to improve their health and reduce their risk of illness and injury. Past surgeons general have used their position to educate Americans about health problems like AIDS and suicide prevention. The surgeon generalís warning in 1964 about the dangers of smoking helped change the course of Americaís health.

Some, like Dr. C. Everett Koop, surgeon general under President Ronald Reagan, became widely known with substantial impact on policy, and others slipped easily from memory.

White House withdraws another key nomination with last-minute pivot for US surgeon general

Meansí nomination follows a pattern from Trump to select people known for their public personas more than their policy positions. In the case of Means, the Republican president said he chose her solely on the recommendation of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ìBobby thought she was fantastic,î Trump said, adding that he did not know her.


Means, who received her undergraduate and medical degrees from Stanford University, began a medical residency in Oregon but did not complete it. Her medical license is listed as inactive. Contacted by phone, Means declined to comment on the record.

She made the recommendation about psychedelics in her 2024 book, ìGood Energy,î which she wrote with her brother, Calley Means, an entrepreneur who now works in the Trump administration as a health adviser and who has said he invested in biopharmaceutical companies that specialize in psychedelics.

Much of the book focuses on metabolic health, what Casey Means calls ìgood energy.î She suggests a number of strategies to help people ìmanage and heal the stressors, traumas, and thought patterns that limit us and contribute to our poor metabolic health and thriving.î

One such strategy is to ìconsider psilocybin-assisted therapy,î referring to the compound found in psychedelic mushrooms. She details her thinking on the subject in a 750-word passage.


ìIf you feel called, I also encourage you to explore intentional, guided psilocybin therapy,î she wrote. ìStrong scientific evidence suggests that this psychedelic therapy can be one of the most meaningful experiences of life for some people, as they have been for me.î

Though there have been some studies suggesting benefits from psychedelics, it has not been shown that benefits outweigh the risks. Psilocybin can cause hours of hallucinations that can be pleasant or terrifying. When paired with talk therapy, it has been studied as a treatment for psychiatric conditions and alcoholism, but very little research has been done in healthy people. Side effects can include increased heart rate, nausea and headaches. Taking it unsupervised can be dangerous. Hallucinations could cause a user to walk into traffic or take other risks.

FAIRFIELD COUNTY, CONNECTICUT - JULY 28: Psilocybin mushrooms stand ready for harvest in a humidified ""fruiting chamber"" in the basement of a private home on July 28, 2023 in Fairfield County, Connecticut. Recent studies have suggested that psilocybin mushrooms, also known as ""magic mushrooms"" have shown promise in combating anxiety, anorexia, depression, PTSD, obsessive-compulsive disorder and various forms of substance abuse. Scientists say psilocybin may promote neuroplasticity, a rewiring of the brain that gives patients fresh perspectives on longstanding psychiatric problems. Although psilocybin is classified in the U.S. as a Schedule 1 substance, making it illegal by federal law, many municipalities throughout the United States, as well as the state of Colorado have moved to decriminalize it locally. Oregon has legalized the adult use of mushrooms, which currently must be administered within regulated ""psilocybin service centers."" (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)
Poison control calls are rising as more people use psilocybin, study finds

Means wrote that psilocybin and other psychedelics have been stigmatized. She touted the benefits of MDMA, also known as ecstasy or molly, for helping people with post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. The Food and Drug Administration last year declined to approve the use of MDMA as a therapy for PTSD after a panel of advisers found the research was flawed and there were significant risks in using it.


Means refers to psychedelics in her book as ìplant medicine.î She describes how she took mushrooms for the first time around Jan. 1, 2021, after she was inspired by ìan internal voice that whispered: itís time to prepare.î

ìI felt myself as part of an infinite and unbroken series of cosmic nesting dolls of millions of mothers and babies before me from the beginning of life,î she wrote, adding that in her experience ìpsilocybin can be a doorway to a different reality that is free from the limiting beliefs of my ego, feelings, and personal history.î

In a newsletter she published in October, Means said she had also used psychedelics to help her make ìspace to find love at 35.î She wrote that she ìdid plant medicine experiences with trusted guidesî to become ready for partnership, punctuating the line with a mushroom emoji. She noted she was not necessarily making recommendations that others do the same.

In a post this month about her White House health policy wish list, Means said she wanted more nutritious food served in schools, suggested putting warning labels on ultra-processed foods, called for investigations into vaccine safety and said she wanted to remove conflicts of interest. She did not specifically mention psychedelics but said that researchers have little incentive to study ìgeneric, natural, and non-patentable drugs and therapiesî and that a portion of research budgets should be devoted to alternative approaches to health.


Calley Means has also advocated for the use of psychedelic drugs, writing in a 2021 blog post that he first tried psilocybin during a challenging time in his life and ìit was the single most meaningful experience of my life ó personally, professionally, and spiritually.î He said in 2022 that he had ìsold all of my 401kî and bought stocks in two companies that are developing and researching psychedelics. He did not respond to messages seeking comment.

Casey Meansí confirmation hearing has not been scheduled. Trump chose Means after questions were raised about the resume of his first pick for surgeon general, former Fox News medical contributor Janette Nesheiwat, and he withdrew her nomination.

"Lawmakers press Kennedy on mass cuts, canceled medical research","Lawmakers repeatedly pressed US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy on canceled medical research and mass layoffs during Wednesday hearings on Trump administration proposals that could lead to even broader cuts.

Democrats on the House Appropriations Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies subcommittee repeatedly asked the secretary to explain cuts this year to health care programs, medical research and staffing before discussing a 2026 budget that would shrink the health agencies further. Kennedy also testified before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on Wednesday afternoon.

Kennedy insisted he would spend the funds that Congress appropriated in the 2026 budget according to law. But Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee, including ranking member Steny Hoyer and health subcommittee ranking member Rosa DeLauro, were focused on the agencyís spending this year, for budgets already authorized.

ìWe have to really keep a clear line here between a questionable proposal for ë26 and what is going on right now against the legislation that we have passed and that has been signed into law,î DeLauro said.

Trump administration cut $2.7 billion in NIH research funding through March, Senate committee minority report says

The administrationís cancellation of National Institutes of Health grants amounted to $2.7 billion in eliminated research, much higher than previous estimates, according to a report issued by Democrats on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on Tuesday.


In a post on X on Tuesday, HHS called the report ìunequivocally falseî and said it was politically motivated.

The secretary defended HHS funding and job cuts in the House subcommtitee hearing, saying that the slashes had reduced redundancy and that the proposed 2026 budget would streamline programs further.

But he also seemed to distance himself from the eliminations led by the US Department of Government Efficiency and said he had protected certain programs, including HeadStart.

ìThere were many instances where I said ëThat would hurt us,í î he told the House committee.

Questions on vaccination
Kennedy also told House lawmakers Wednesday that Americans should not take advice from him on vaccinations.


ìMy opinions on vaccines are irrelevant,î he said. ìEverybody should make that decision. I seem like Iím being evasive, but I donít think people should be taking advice, medical advice, from me.î

The comments came after Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wisconsin, asked Kennedy whether he would vaccinate his children against measles today. ìProbably for measles,î the secretary answered before adding that vaccination is a personal choice.

Pocan followed up with questions about whether Kennedy would vaccinate his children against chickenpox and polio today. Kennedy noted that chickenpox shots are not required in Europe and said again he did not want to be seen as advising families.

ìWhat weíre trying to do is to lay out the pros and cons accurately, as we understand them,î he said.

Kennedy has previously disclosed that his children received the recommended childhood schedule of vaccines when they were younger. As founder of the nonprofit Childrenís Health Defense, he has also criticized that schedule and claimed that the side effects of certain vaccines ó including unproven links to autism ó outweigh their benefits.


The secretary announced in April that health agencies would start a massive research and testing effort to distill the causes of autism, citing ìenvironmental toxinsî and other exposures.

Efforts to tackle racial disparities
In his opening statement at the House subcommittee hearing, Kennedy said that one of the top priorities for the agencyís budget was to ìeliminate DEI funding and redirect resources toward real poverty reduction.î

Democratic Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey pushed him on the topic, highlighting vast racial disparities in maternal mortality in the US and other health issues.


ìFew things enrage me more than the racist attacks I see this administration carrying out by embarking on an ignorant crusade to rid the government of any programs that are working to improve the lives of Black Americans,î Watson Coleman said. ìThe administration has moved to ban the words Black, race, bias, minority, oppression, prejudice, discrimination, disparity and racism. Any grant application on federal programs that include these words had them immediately stripped.î

HHS cuts 10,000 employees in major overhaul of health agencies

These actions are an attempt ìto legitimize racial discrimination,î she said, and low-income minorities will suffer the consequences most.

ìIt should not be controversial to make right a health care system that was not built to help people like me, to take my concerns, my pain, my health very seriously in this country,î Watson Coleman said. ìHow exactly will HHS banning the words that we use to describe ourselves make us healthier?î


Kennedy said that President Donald Trump has a vision for a ìcolorblind administration,î akin to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.ís ideals.

ìThe commitment is there. Weíre just reorganizing,î he said.

But he balked when Watson Coleman pressured him for rationale behind eliminating a program to help low-income households with their energy bills to have heat in the winter and stay cool in the summer: the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP.

ìMy time has expired,î Kennedy said.


ìWell then, so has your legitimacy,î Watson Coleman said.

Only when prompted to follow up did Kennedy offer a brief explanation, saying that the administrationís broader energy policy aims to bring energy costs down in general.

ìIf it doesnít happen, then Congress is welcome ñ and they should ñ appropriate the money for LIHEAP, and I will spend it,î Kennedy said. îI already allocated $400 million from LIHEAP during the last 100 days, and I will continue to do and get that funding to the people who need it in this country if the fuel costs do not go down.î

Lead program cuts
Kennedy suggested at the Senate hearing that experts in the US Centers for Disease Control and Preventionís lead poisoning prevention program were fired in error during the agencyís sweeping cuts in April.


During questioning by Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, on the impact that the lead program cuts might have on a lead contamination crisis in Milwaukee public schools, Kennedy agreed that childhood lead poisoning is ìan extremely significant concern.î

Baldwin then asked, ìDo you intend to eliminate this branch at CDC? Yes or no?î

ìNo, we do not,î Kennedy said.

Itís the second time Kennedy has suggested that lead experts at the CDC were cut in error. When asked during an appearance in April about cuts to the program, he responded, ìThere are some programs that are being cut that are being reinstated. I believe thatís one of them.î


An HHS spokesperson later said that the CDCís lead program wouldnít be reinstated but that the work would continue through a different CDC office, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.

However, experts in the CDCís lead program have not been rehired, according to Dr. Eric Svendsen, who was director of the CDCís Division of Environmental Health Science and Practice, which included the lead poisoning prevention program.

The entire division and all of its programs were cut during the April 1 layoffs. ìWe are all still RIFd,î Svendsen confirmed Wednesday.

Asked for clarification Wednesday, an agency official told CNN, ìAs HHS finalizes its detailed reorganization plans, the Department will be looking into all strategic programs and priorities for the Secretary and the nation. The work of this program will continue.î

Kennedy has reinstated some other workers at CDC. In an exchange with Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington earlier Wednesday, Kennedy said that he had reinstated 328 workers with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in Morgantown, West Virginia, and another site. Those offices worked on mine safety and on health issues in first responders after the response to the September 11 attacks, he said.


ìThe work on mine safety will continue,î Kennedy said. ìWe understand itís critically important function. And I did not want to see it end.î

Murray said other NIOSH workers, including those at an office in Spokane, Washington, have not been reinstated, however.

ìI would just say you canít fire 90% of the people and assume the work gets done,î she said.

Micah Niemeier-Walsh, vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3840, representing NIOSH employees in Cincinnati, said in a statement Wednesday that ìSome NIOSH employees have been reinstated, however, many critical functions of NIOSH remain negatively impacted by the Reductions in Force. Ö The union is determined to continue to advocate for full reinstatement of all NIOSH employees. All NIOSH programs are important for the health and safety of working peoeple in this country.î


Some workers at the US Food and Drug Administration have also had their firings reversed, including staffers handling Freedom of Information Act requests, those who negotiate user fees and some laboratory staff.

Additionally, more than a dozen scientists at the FDAís Moffett Lab in Illinois focusing on food safety had their RIF notices reversed, according to a person familiar with the situation who declined to be named because theyíre not authorized to speak on behalf of the agency.

EPA announces rollback for some Biden-era limits on so-called forever chemicals in drinking water,"The Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday that it plans to weaken limits on some ìforever chemicalsî in drinking water that were finalized last year, while maintaining standards for two common ones.

The Biden administration set the first federal drinking water limits for PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, finding they increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and babies being born with low birth weight. Those limits on PFAS, which are human-made and donít easily break down in nature, were expected to reduce their levels for millions of people.

Limits on three types of PFAS, including what are known as GenX substances found in North Carolina, will be scrapped and reconsidered by the agency, as will a limit on a mixture of several types of PFAS.

The Biden administrationís rule also set standards for the two common types of PFAS, referred to as PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion, effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected. The EPA will keep those standards, but give utilities two extra years ó until 2031 ó to comply.

ìWe are on a path to uphold the agencyís nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water. At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance,î said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.


The development was first reported by The Washington Post.

Large scale changes and utility pushback
It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for certain, newer types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administrationís limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.

Health advocates praised Bidenís administration for the limits. But water utilities complained, saying treatment systems are expensive and that customers will end up paying more. The utilities sued the EPA.

SANTA ANA, CA - APRIL 26: Pouring a glass of water from a kitchen faucet in Santa Ana on Friday, April 26, 2024. According to a study by the US Geological Survey, 45% of the tap water in the United States is contaminated with ""forever chemicals"" that are considered dangerous to human health.  In recent years, studies have found that humans exposed to some PFAS chemicals are more prone to everything from high cholesterol and hypertension to testicular cancer, breast cancer and, for girls, early-onset puberty.

Scientists discover concerning new source of ëforever chemicalsí in drinking water

The EPAís actions align with some arguments in the utilitiesí lawsuit. They argued the EPA lacked authority to regulate a mixture of PFAS and said the agency didnít properly support limits on several newer types of PFAS that the EPA now plans to rescind. They also sought the two-year extension.


Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, said the move is illegal. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.

ìWith a stroke of the pen, EPA is making a mockery of the Trump administrationís promise to deliver clean water for Americans,î Olson said.

President Donald Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks. The EPA plans to loosen regulations for greenhouse gas emissions, cleanup standards for coal plant waste and car emission limits, among many other clean air and water rules.

Zeldinís history with PFAS is more nuanced; during his time as a New York congressman, he supported legislation to regulate forever chemicals.

Evidence of harm builds and so does the cost
Manufactured by companies like Chemours and 3M, PFAS were incredibly useful in many applications -ñ among them, helping clothes to withstand rain and ensuring that firefighting foam snuffed out flames. But the chemicals also accumulate in the body. As science advanced in recent years, evidence of harm at far lower levels became clearer.


The Biden-era EPA estimated the rule will cost about $1.5 billion to implement each year. Water utility associations say the costs, combined with recent mandates to replace lead pipes, will raise residentsí bills and fall hardest on small communities with few resources.

The Biden administration did work to address cost concerns. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS, utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters.

Utilities see partial relief, activists see a backslide
Some utilities have been surprised to find out they are over limits. And small water providers might struggle with compliance costs and expertise.


ìThis gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand,î said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.

Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith. He suspects the utility industry will continue to sue over those limits. Environmental groups will likely file challenges, too.

New Trump admin plans targeting forever chemicals ëraise serious red flags,í experts say

Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group, said utilities may not have to install treatment thatís as broadly effective if they just have to focus on two types of older PFAS.


ìYou really reduce what utilities have to do to make sure that the other, newer generation PFAS are capturedî she said.

When the Biden administration announced its rule, the head of the EPA traveled to North Carolina and was introduced by activist Emily Donovan, who said she was grateful for the first federal standards. She had long campaigned for tougher rules for GenX substances that had contaminated a local river.

Now the EPA says it will roll back those GenX limits.

He was tired of just surviving. A pig kidney gave him a shot at living,"Tim Andrews knew that he needed dialysis to manage his end-stage kidney disease, but over months of treatment, he started to wonder whether it was worth it. He was exhausted and hopeless. He missed his grandkids.

It kept him alive, but it didnít feel like living.

Desperate for another option, he found a surprising alternative: an organ from a pig.


Andrews, 67, is a pioneer of a new kind of medicine. In January, he had an experimental cross-species transplant of a kidney from a genetically modified pig. He is one of only a handful of patients who have undergone the experimental procedure. For now, heís the lone person in the United States known to be living with a pig kidney.

Andrews knew that there was a risk to trying something so new, but if the kidney gave him just one more day free from dialysis, it was worth it ó for him and for fellow patients.


ìThis will do something for humanity,î Andrews said.

ëPick a boxí
Andrews had been living with diabetes since the 1990s, managing the condition with insulin. About 2Ω years ago, he went to the doctor feeling unusually tired. Tests showed that he had stage 3 kidney failure ó his kidneys were still working but less efficiently than they should. He was relieved to learn that it was manageable with medication, monitoring and lifestyle changes.

But about a month later, a doctor delivered more bad news: Andrewsí kidney disease had rapidly progressed to end-stage disease. Dialysis was the only option to keep him alive until he could get an organ transplant.


Dialysis is highly effective at cleaning the blood, but it places a ìhuge burdenî on the body, Andrewsí doctors told CNN. At first, Andrews thought it was going well. But about six months in, he had a heart attack.

ìIt takes a toll on you, emotionally and physically,î said Andrews, who lives in New Hampshire.

Experimental transplants with organs from gene-edited pigs see major steps forward

He was tempted to forgo dialysis entirely until a doctor warned that if he did so, he should ìpick a box.î With the state his kidneys were in, his body would be in it within a couple months.


For six hours, three days a week, he kept at it. On days off, heíd sleep. By the time he woke up, heíd have to start the process all over again.

When he thinks about his experience with dialysis, Andrews appreciates what the doctors and nurses did to keep him alive. But when he kept having to sit in that oversized green chair hooked up to the dialysis machine, the whole situation hurt his spirit, too.

He was too tired to walk or get groceries. He couldnít eat. Even in the few hours he felt OK, his immune system was so weak that he had to avoid crowds. Dialysis meant no more Red Sox games, no more fun with grandchildren, no more travel.

As the hours ticked past, he couldnít think about gratitude. All he could think about was death.

The dialysis side effects got so bad that he wanted to quit, but his wife, Karen, wouldnít let him. He also kept hearing his fatherís voice in his mind, telling him to stop complaining and start doing something about his situation.

ëI know what end-stage meansí
Andrews learned that his odds of getting a human kidney donation were not good.


Nearly 90,0000 people are on the waiting list for a kidney in the US. Most donít get a transplant because they become too sick or die while waiting for a match.

Andrewsí chances were slimmer than most because of his rare blood type. People typically wait about three to five years for a donor kidney. For him, it would likely be seven to 10 years. Doctors thought his body could take only five years of dialysis.

ìI was a little short there,î Andrews said. ìI know what end-stage means.î

But his research gave him hope. Massachusetts General Hospital was also investigating animal alternatives. He demanded that the hospital liaison put him in touch with one of the doctors from that project: Dr. Leonardo Riella, medical director of kidney transplantation at Mass General.


When they first met, Andrews was ìvery frail,î Riella said. He arrived in a wheelchair. But when Riella mentioned whatís known as xenotransplantation ó transplants using genetically modified pig organs ó Andrewsí eyes ìsparked.î

ìHe said ëTell me what I need to do.í î

Riella told Andrews heíd need to get a lot stronger if he wanted a transplant of any kind.

ìThey said, ëPrepare your body for battle,í î Andrewsí wife, Karen, remembered.


For the next few months, Andrews went to the gym and physical therapy, got his teeth fixed, got several vaccines and lost 22 pounds.


When he went back to the clinic a few months later, Riella said, Andrews was ìalmost running around the room.î

He talked to people about the procedure. He prayed. His wife, Karen, also had to agree: If they got the green light, she would need to sign consent papers. On the slim chance he got a virus from the organ, sheíd be exposed to it, too.

ìI was a little taken aback by that,î Karen said. But she didnít have any doubt that this transplant, though unusual, was the right way to go.

ìIt has to be better than dialysis,î she said. ìHe was just feeling so awful all the time.î

A new birthday
In January, it was finally time.


On surgery day, his family hugged and kissed him good-bye. Karen gave him a high-five and wished him luck.

The procedure was supposed to take four hours, but only about two hours and 15 minutes in, Karen said, her phone rang. The doctors were done early and said it went ìunbelievably well.î

A team of doctors told Karen that they had successfully attached the genetically modified pig kidney alongside Andrewsí nonfunctioning organ.


ìThey put the kidney on the table and started connecting him to the kidney, and he actually peed across the room,î Karen said, laughing. Everyone in the operating room started cheering.

ìOf course, I started bawling like a baby,î Karen said.

It all happened so fast that even the doctors who did the surgery were surprised.

ìIt worked right away, and the numbers started getting better,î Riella said.


After waking up from surgery, Andrews felt ìreenergized and revitalized.î

ìI was alive, and I hadnít been in a long time,î he said.

He hopped off the bed and tap-danced across the room, he said. His mind felt clear.

ìIt was a miracle,î Andrews said. So much so, he declared that he had a new birthday.


ìI said ëlook at me, itís like Iím like a new man,í î he said. ìItís like new birth. I said, ëIíve got a new birthday. 1/25/25 is my new birthday.í î

ëNow I can do anything I wantí
After the transplant, Andrews spent a week in the hospital but only out of an abundance of caution.

In the months since, heís had a few ìsmall bumps in the road,î including a three-week hospital stay. But the pig kidney does what a kidney from a living human donor would do.

Life is returning to normal. Andrews cooks, vacuums and takes long walks with his dog, Cupcake.

He currently takes more than 50 pills every day as the doctors try to figure out the type of medications heíll need with his new kidney. But living without dialysis has made such a difference.

ìBasically, I was just sleeping, sick all the time. Now I can do anything I want,î Andrews said.

He even lets himself picture a future. He canít wait to see his grandkids again.

ìThey saw me at the lowest, and now theyíll be able to see me alive and laughing and carrying on like Grandpa does,î Andrews said.

If all goes well, he hopes to take Karen to Europe in a year. He said theyíve put it off far too long.

ëItís a learning curveí
Still, Andrews knows that the pig kidney may not work long-term. Heís still on the wait list for a human organ. If the pig kidney can act as a bridge that keeps him healthy enough to wait for a match from a human donor, that would be a medical first ó and a success.

Andrews is the fourth living patient in the US to get a genetically modified pig kidney transplant, and he wonít be the last. In addition to the ongoing trial at Mass General in conjunction with biotech firm eGenesis, United Therapeutics Corp ñ the other main biotech company helping create the pig kidneys ñ announced in February that it would be allowed to start its own clinical trials with New York University.

In March 2024, Richard Slayman became the first living patient in the world to get a genetically modified pig kidney. The operation at Mass General went well, but he died two months later from causes not related to the transplant.

Doctors said they learned a lot from their experience with Slayman. He had scarring on his heart after eight years of dialysis, Riella said, and itís probably important to get patients like Andrews, who havenít needed dialysis as long.

In April 2024, Lisa Pisano became the first person to receive a mechanical heart pump as well as a gene-edited pig kidney. The organ failed due to limited blood flow and was removed the next month. She died in July 2024.

Then, in November 2024, NYU transplanted 53-year-old Towana Looney with a genetically modified pig kidney. It functioned for four months and nine days, the longest yet, but doctors had to remove it in April when her immune system started to reject it.

Figuring out how to manage rejection is going to be key, doctors say. The pig kidneys Andrews and Slayman got had 69 genomic edits, while Looneyís had fewer. Doctors say they still donít know how many edits are necessary, but both versions of the modified pig kidneys had pig genes removed and human genes added to make the organ more compatible with the human body.

Patients also receive anti-rejection drugs and wearable remote monitoring tools. But doctors still are figuring out how much medicine and monitoring is needed.

ìIt is a learning curve,î Riella said.

Riella is hopeful xenotransplantation may one day solve the worldís organ shortage.

ìI think patients like Tim will be remembered as heroes,î he said. ìWithout them willing to take the risk, we wouldnít be able to move this to the clinic.î

Andrews remembers what it felt like to have to make the choice. But he also remembers what it was like to sit for hours at the dialysis center.

ìItís hard to come to terms with mortality. You think ëah, I can handle thatí and everything, but itís tough,î he said recently, back in the green chair where he underwent dialysis. ìIt was very tough to realize that was it.

ìI was going to die in this building.î

He found a way out. He hopes his story will inspire others to look for hope, too.

ìI see way too many people give up,î Andrews said. ìDonít give up.î

Why a sheet pan is the secret to make every meal easier than ever,"Throughout more than two decades of developing new recipes as ìHungry Girl,î Lisa Lillien has amassed quite the collection of appliances. Her kitchen counter is lined with an air fryer, slow cooker, Instant pot, blender, toaster and more. But if you ask Lillien, who says, ìIím not a dietitian, Iím not a nutritionist, Iím just hungry,î thereís one tool she comes back to again and again: the sheet pan.

ìWhy sheet pans right now? I hear from my email subscribers often, and nearly everybody wants easier and faster options,î Lillien said. ìSheet pans really are an MVP of the kitchen because you can place something on the pan, pop it in the oven and you can go about your day.î

Unlike some of those other tools, it wonít take up precious counter space and often is available for less than $20.

ìIím not a cooking snob. I donít think you need a certain pan, and it certainly doesnít have to be expensive,î Lillien said, noting that the sheet pan she swears by has been in her arsenal since 1999.

The ingredients you cook on it need not be exclusive, either. ìWeíre not promoting that you go buy every grocery from a boutique grocery store,î she noted. ìHungry Girl is more Walmart than Vanity Fair. I mean that in the best way possible; itís just for everybody. As am I. I want to make smarter, better food choices, but I also love food.î

Thatís the philosophy behind her entire Hungry Girl empire, which includes free daily emails with recipes and healthy cooking tips, a magazine, a podcast (that often reviews products available at major online and in-person retailers), and 16 cookbooks. In the latest, ìHungry Girl Sheet Pan Cookbook: One-Pan Wonders Under 400 Calories,î Lillien shares under-400-calorie recipe ideas for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, sides and desserts ó all made on a sheet pan.


ìSheet pans can do it all: baking, roasting, broiling and even serving,î Lillien wrote in her book. Theyíre ìa breeze to clean. Plus, the raised edges help contain oven spills and drips.î

Taking a cue from popular fast food restaurant menu items, viral food trends and beloved comfort foods, the cookbook includes one-pan tricks to make every meal easier. We asked Lillien to coach us through an entire day of sheet pan eats.

Whatís for breakfast?
When flapjacks are doctored up with a big pat of butter and generous shower of maple syrup, ìpancakes are not always the healthiest. Theyíre not always easy to cook evenly, either,î Lillien said. ìWhen I make pancakes with a skillet or griddle, I often end up burning the later batches because the heat of the pan can be challenging to control.î


Lillien sought a solution, which she found and integrated into her recipes for brownie, strawberry and blueberry pancake bars. A sheet pan cooks the batter evenly and allows you to make a weekís worth of pancake squares that you can enjoy now, refrigerate for tomorrow or freeze for later.

To try this at home: Line a sheet pan with parchment paper and spritz it with oil or nonstick cooking spray. Mix up your favorite pancake batter. (Lillien digs a whole wheat flour-based blend for a fiber boost.) Pour it into the prepared sheet pan, sprinkle on any desired toppings, like berries or chocolate chips. and bake at 425 degrees Fahrenheit for about 15 to 17 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the center springs back when you touch it.

Itís like In-N-Out for lunch
Typically, if you attempted to recreate a fast food value meal at home, youíd need a deep fryer, grill or griddle, and perhaps a skillet to cook some of the toppings, such as onions or bacon. But Lillienís ìultimate lunchî ó In-N-Out Burger copycat Animal-Style Burger Patties ó shows how to DIY on sheet pans. You could try this same concept with any burger and fries you like.

Pictured is Lisa Lillien's take on In-N-Out's Animal-Style Burger Patties, with turnip fries.

For her fast food-inspired midday meal, it all starts with the sauce. In a small bowl, stir together ? cup Thousand Island dressing (light, if you like), 2 tablespoons finely minced onion, Ω teaspoon sugar and Ω teaspoon white wine vinegar. If you have another favorite burger sauce, feel free to swap that in.

Then prepare º-pound burger patties with whatever meat and seasonings you desire. (Lillien likes 95% lean ground beef jazzed up with garlic powder, onion powder, salt and black pepper ó the same spice blend she uses to season the fries.)


Place the burgers and 2 cups of chopped onion on one sheet pan, and fry-shaped spears of turnips or any root vegetable or sturdy squash on another. Bake at 425 F until the fries are crispy, the onions are tender and the burgers are cooked to your preferred doneness level. Top a serving of fries with a patty, a spoonful of sauce, a scoop of cooked onions and a slice of cheddar cheese. Bake until the sauce is hot and the cheese is melty.

Itís time for dinner
An often-overlooked benefit of sheet pan cooking, according to Lillien, is the ability to multitask. The large cooking surface makes it possible to cook multiple items on the same sheet without overcrowding. One of Lillienís favorite recipes in the book, Honey Mustard Pretzel Salmon with Roasted Carrots, asks for just 35 minutes and six ingredients, and leaves you with a well-balanced main dish and a side.


ìHoney mustard is such a good flavor-booster. Itís very versatile and so low in calories,î Lillien said, and it works like the ìglueî to adhere the crushed pretzels. ìThe richness of the salmon works so nicely with the tang and the sweetness of the honey mustard and the salty pretzels.î

The best kind of workout? One that trains both your body and brain,"(CNN) ó We already know exercise is good for our bodies, but itís also an essential tool for managing mental health. Yet many people still separate physical fitness from mental wellness, viewing them as two different goals rather than parts of the same whole.

Too often, workout routines are designed with only the body in mind, focusing on burning calories, building strength or improving flexibility. Whatís often missing is intentionality ó movement designed not just to make you sweat but also to help you feel better mentally and emotionally.

Early research suggests why exercise is so protective against brain disease

Research shows that consistent physical activity can ease symptoms of anxiety and depression, sharpen executive functioning and improve sleep quality, a key factor in emotional regulation and overall mental health. But not all movement is created equal when it comes to mental health. The type of movement ó and how you approach it ó matters.

As a mind-body coach in professional sports for more than two decades, I have helped elite athletes build durable, mobile bodies while also supporting their mental resilience ó using movement and breath to regulate the nervous system, stay grounded under pressure and maintain sharp focus. These same tools and principles can help anyone strengthen body and mind, improving how they move and feel every day.

Mindful movement vs. just exercising
Pushing yourself through a high-intensity workout while mentally checked out or disconnected from your body doesnít offer the same mental health benefits as moving with awareness. True mind-body fitness involves being present during movement, using intentional breathing and training in ways that support your nervous system.


The brain and body are deeply interconnected through the nervous system. One of the key players in this connection is the vagus nerve, which runs from your brain stem to your gut and influences functions as varied as heart rate, digestion, mood and emotional regulation.

When you exercise with focused, deep breathing ó you stimulate the vagus nerve, which activates your parasympathetic nervous system (your ìrest and recoverî state). Doing so can calm your mind, lower stress and improve focus by shifting your body out of ìfight-or-flightî mode, helping you achieve restful states more easily.

On the other hand, when exercise is overly intense or performed with poor breathing patterns and no recovery, it can spike stress hormones and leave you feeling more depleted than energized. Thatís why itís important to choose exercises and formats that align with your needs and goals ó not just physically, but mentally and emotionally, too.

How to build a mind-body fitness routine
You donít need to overhaul your workout regimen to make it more mind-body focused. Start by layering in these five simple strategies. Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain.

1. Anchor your workouts with breath
Breath is the most efficient and effective way to influence your nervous system. Use slow, intentional breathing before, during and after your workouts.


ï In warm-ups: Use diaphragmatic breathing to downshift from your day and connect to your body.

Optimize your breathing with these tips

ï During mobility work: Use your breathing to move your rib cage in ways that support better posture, positioning and rotation. For example, when twisting your upper body to the right, use inhalations to expand your ribs on the right side and exhale to contract your ribs on the left side, to facilitate the rotation.

ï During strength training: Exhale through the effort phase ó as you would when pushing up in a push-up or standing up from a squat ó to activate core control and regulate tension.


ï In cooldowns: Practice extended exhales, which further stimulate the vagus nerve, to promote relaxation and recovery. I recommend doubling the length of your exhales during recovery sessions by practicing a four-count inhale with an eight-count exhale.

2. Incorporate mobility with intention
Mobility training improves flexibility and joint health, but its benefits go beyond the physical. Practicing breath-driven mobility drills, such as the three-way hip flexor release and windmill twist to also sharpen body awareness and support nervous system regulation. Add exercises such as these to your warm-ups or active recovery days, focusing on coordinating breath and movement to build physical control and mental clarity.

3. Balance intensity to build resilience
High-intensity workouts have benefits, but overdoing them can chronically elevate stress levels and impair recovery. To support your nervous system, balance your weekly training with lower-intensity sessions. Activities such as walking, yoga, breath-focused mobility and body-weight strength work help keep you active while promoting resilience, emotional regulation and injury prevention.

4. Train with presence and precision
No matter what type of training youíre doing ó strength, mobility, cardio or recovery ó your mental presence affects how your body performs and adapts. Rushing through reps or zoning out increases the risk of poor form, injury and missed benefits. Focus on the quality of your movement: Pay attention to alignment, control your pace and stay aware of how your body feels. When your mind starts to wander, use your breath to ground yourself in the present and reconnect with your body. Presence turns every exercise into an opportunity to build both physical skill and mental clarity.

5. Build in mental check-ins

Before, during and after your workouts, take 30 seconds at a time to assess how you feel. Ask yourself: Where am I holding tension? Howís my breathing? What do I need right now ó intensity or grounding?

These moments of self-awareness turn your fitness practice into a tool for emotional regulation, not just physical conditioning.

How to structure a mind-body-focused week
Hereís a sample weekly structure to balance strength, mobility and nervous system support:


Two days: Strength training with breath-focused movement prep and mobility cooldown.

Two days: Breath-driven mobility or Pilates and low-intensity cardio (walking, light cycling, etc.).

One day: A recovery day with breathwork and gentle stretching or yoga.

Two days: Mixed training (circuit or flow-style) that blends mobility, strength and cardio.

Although having a plan is important, mind-body fitness is about listening to how you feel and adjusting accordingly. Movement can shift your mental and emotional state, but it works best when you begin with awareness and choose what best meets your needs, whether that means calming down or boosting energy. The goal is to support ó not override ó your system.

"Disrupted US vaccine meetings could threaten timelines, access and transparency around shots","CNN
 ó 
Two long-planned vaccine meetings ó one at the US Centers for Disease Control and another at the US Food and Drug Administration ó have now been disrupted under the watch of US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., stirring questions about whether seasonal flu shots or other lifesaving vaccines will be delayed or harder to access.

The February meeting of the CDCís Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, was postponed ìto accommodate public comment,î according to a note online. The three-day meeting, which had been scheduled for this week, was to review the safety and effectiveness of vaccines for meningococcal disease, which is seeing a resurgence, as well as RSV, flu, chikungunya and mpox. It also included two votes related to Vaccines for Children, the government program that buys and distributes vaccines to state and local health departments for children whose families wouldnít otherwise be able to pay for them.

FDA meeting to choose flu vaccine composition canceled without explanation

ACIP typically meets three times a year, in February, June and October. Thereís no word on whether or when the February meeting will be rescheduled and itís unclear whether the delay will hinder access to shots.

On Wednesday, the FDA canceled a March 13 meeting of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, which was to discuss the recipe manufacturers must follow to make this fallís flu shots. No explanation was given for the cancellation.

In a statement to CNN on Thursday, the FDA said it would still weigh in on the makeup of flu shots but didnít indicate whether it would seek its advisersí guidance or allow for the public discussion and debate that usually occurs.

ìThe FDA will make public its recommendations to manufacturers in time for updated vaccines to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season,î the statement said.


The uncertainty around the governmentís process for regulating and recommending vaccines comes as the US is in the grips of a brutal flu season and experiencing a resurgence of measles, a vaccine preventable disease. Experts say these infections are increasing because of growing hesitancy to use vaccines, something they fear the new HHS director will only encourage.

Kennedy casts doubt on vaccine advisers
Kennedy maintains that he is not anti-vaccine, but he has repeatedly cast doubt on the safety and effectiveness of immunizations and questioned the research and regulations that allow them to be used.

Kennedy, whose financial disclosures show he has made money from law firms that sue vaccine manufacturers, has also impugned some of the experts who advise federal agencies on vaccines. During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy incorrectly stated that 97% of the members of the CDCís vaccine advisory committee had conflicts of interest. In fact, the panel has strict policies to guard against conflicts, and a screening process for members to ensure they are impartial when they vote.

Members of FDAís vaccine committee are also subject to strict conflict of interest rules and are required to disclose potential conflicts during meetings.

This week, former CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden wrote that false claims that ACIP members vote based on their financial ties is among the ìmost damagingî falsehoods about vaccines.

Frieden said the 97% figure comes from a 2009 report, issued when he was CDC director. He is now president and CEO of the nonprofit Resolve to Save Lives.

It was an audit of lengthy and detailed conflict of interest forms submitted by all experts who served as CDC advisers in 2007. He said 97% had at least one missing response, which could have meant someone forgot to do something as simple as initial a page. He said it is not the same thing as a conflict of interest.

ìI really think that this is classic misinformation,î Frieden told CNN.

Frieden also raised alarm about the postponed ACIP meeting, writing in a recent post on LinkedIn, ìItís certain there will be misleading, inaccurate information claiming ACIP members have conflicts of interest. Hereís the plain truth: ACIP, made up of pediatricians, public health specialists, and parents, is the gold standard for open, transparent recommendations on vaccine safety and effectiveness.î

ëDeadly consequencesí: Health agencies reel from thousands of job cuts while critical research grants remain on hold

Without either vaccine committee weighing in on vaccine regulation or recommendations, health-care providers worry there will be delays on vaccines or limits on peopleís ability to access them.

ìCancelling this meeting means vaccine makers may not have the vital information and time they need to produce and distribute targeted vaccines before the next flu season,î Dr. Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said after the cancellation of the FDA flu shot meeting. ìIf the FDA meeting is not immediately rescheduled, many lives that could be saved by vaccination will be lost.î

In a February 20 open letter to Kennedy, Acting CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez and Sen. Bill Cassidy, a doctor and chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, a coalition of groups called the Partnership to Fight Infectious Disease pushed for the ìprompt reschedulingî of the ACIP meeting.

ìEach ACIP meeting holds tremendous weight and relevance. Infectious diseases are constantly evolving opponents; vaccines are among the best tools for constantly adapting and responding to the latest public health threats,î the letter said.

ìMaking America healthy requires healthy discussion and timely, evidence-based decisions. This meeting should be no different.î

Flu shot decision in limbo
There are several different ways to make flu vaccines, but the most common is to grow the selected candidate viruses in chicken eggs ó a painstaking operation that takes months to finish.

For that reason, selection of the strains that will be included in flu vaccines is carefully orchestrated to be sure that manufacturers can deliver their shots to doctorís offices and pharmacies in time.

In order for flu vaccines to be sold in the US, they must contain strains that are officially selected by the FDA.

That decision typically comes after a meeting of the World Health Organizationís Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, a network of seven collaborating centers and four essential regulatory labs, which are based in the US, UK, Japan, China, Russia and Australia. Both the CDC and FDA are members, and representatives from both agencies participated in the deliberations which got underway this week, WHO said.

ìThe US did participate in this meeting,î Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHOís technical lead for Covid-19, said at a news briefing on Friday.

ìI want to be very clear that the US is still contributing. I know that thereís a lot of attention on the US right now, but we are going to continue to emphasize the importance of this global system thatís in place.î

These experts meet twice a year ó in the fall and spring ó to choose strains for countries in the Southern and Northern Hemispheres.

On Friday, WHO announced the strains that it thinks will most closely match the viruses that will be making people sick next fall. Those picks would swap out the H3N2 component of this years vaccine, which was only a partial match to the circulating viruses, for a new one.

ìI think the match is not perfect, but it is a reasonable match, and is still the best preventative we have against infection with influenza,î said Prof. Ian Barr, deputy director at the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory, and a member of GISRS, in a new briefing after the strain selection

The FDA said it will make public its recommendations to vaccine manufacturers in time for updated shots to be available for the 2025-26 flu season.

What typically happens next is that the 17-member FDA vaccine committee would meet and publicly discuss the recommendation, and then make its own endorsement. The agency ultimately makes the final decision, which can differ from its advisersí, although they generally align.

This year, there wonít be an advisory meeting. The FDA said it would still make recommendations to manufacturers but didnít specify how it would come to a decision or when.

ìIf thereís no FDA recommended strains, the US manufacturers are kind of stuck,î said Dr. LJ Tan who is chief policy and partnerships officer for nonprofit vaccine advocacy group Immunize.org.

Flu vaccine manufacturers contacted by CNN on Thursday said the missed VRBPAC meeting wouldnít break their stride.

ìJust as every year, we have already begun production for the 2025-2026 flu season in the Northern Hemisphere and will be ready to support final strain selections in time for the season,î wrote Sanofi in a statement to CNN.

GSK also said it will continue to work with FDA on its flu strain recommendation in the US.

But canceling the VRBPAC meeting will deprive Americans of public discussion and debate that happens when these experts meet. It makes the process less transparent, Immunize.orgís Tan said.

ìItís very dangerous to bypass your expert advisory committee,î Tan said.

When experts are out of the conversation
In his Senate confirmation hearings, Kennedy promised ìradical transparencyî at HHS.

ìPublic health agencies should be transparent and if we want Americans to restore trust in the public health agencies, we need transparency,î Kennedy said.

Vaccine advocates say canceling advisory committee meetings undermines that goal.

ìYou heard what we thought. We disagreed on some things, and for people who are interested, you can see how we arrived at the conclusion that we did,î said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a member of FDAís VRBPAC who is also a pediatrician and immunologist at the University of Iowa.

Perlman said he was also worried that skipping committee meetings would deprive the public of a window into the governmentís vaccine decisions.

ìThe country is in so much flux right now about what it thinks about vaccines, what it thinks about medical devices, what it thinks about drugs. The more transparency there is, hopefully, the more people who are undecided about things will see where the committee is coming from,î Perlman told CNNís Meg Tirrell.

Other experts agreed the committees are an important layer of independent review.

ìItís kind of taking experts out of the conversation,î said Dr. William Moss, a pediatrician who directs of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ìMany of these decisions are tricky and nuanced, and having the opportunity for a group of experts who are familiar with these vaccines and familiar with these diseases. You know, have an open discussion is critically important.î

The FDA has not said how it will choose vaccine strains for the fall, but if it follows WHOís recommendation, it will mean that the US will be relying on data from the organization despite President Donald Trumpís order that the US withdraw its support from WHO and stop sharing information.

ìItís part of the chaos, whether itís planned or not, or just incompetence,î Moss said.

"Harvard Law School bought a copy of Magna Carta for $27. Turns out, it's actually an original","A ìcopyî of Magna Carta bought decades ago by Harvard Law School for just $27.50 is now understood to be an extremely rare original from 1300, according to new research.

British historians were able to verify the documentís true authenticity after an academic stumbled across the item while looking through Harvard Law Schoolís online archives.

ìI was just working at homeÖ looking for unofficial copies of Magna Carta and finding quite a lot of them,î David Carpenter, a professor of medieval history at Kingís College London, told CNN Thursday, recounting the moment he made the discovery.


ìI finally came to Harvard Law School manuscript number 172, clicked on that, expecting to see a statute book. And what I sawÖ was an original of the 1300 Magna Carta,î Carpenter said.

Shocked by his discovery, the academic said he quickly contacted Nicholas Vincent, a professor of medieval history at the University of East Anglia and a fellow ìMagna Carta pundit.î

ìI said, ëis this what I think it is?í And he said, ëyeah, I think it is too,íî Carpenter recounted.

Magna Carta (Great Charter) is often regarded as the earliest declaration of human rights, credited with enshrining the rights of man in English law.

According to the United Kingdomís Parliament website, the charter was the first ìto put into writing the principle that the king and his government was not above the law.î

Today, it is revered around the world as the document that established the principle that everyone ñ including the monarch ñ was subject to the rule of law.

ìHe (the King) couldnít just say, ëoff with your head, into prison, Iím seizing your property.í If he wanted to act against you, he had to do so by due legal process,î Carpenter said.

The academics believe that the Harvard document is one of just seven from King Edward Iís 1300 issue of Magna Carta that still survive.

Amanda Watson, Harvard Law Schoolís assistant dean for library services, congratulated the work of the British academics on their ìfantastic discovery.î She added that the new research ìexemplifies what happens when magnificent collections, like Harvard Law Libraryís, are opened to brilliant scholars.î

Harvardís Law School Library bought the document in 1946 via auction from London bookdealers Sweet & Maxwell, according to its accession register. The auction catalogue described the manuscript as a ìcopyÖmade in 1327Ö somewhat rubbed and damp-stained,î a press release announcing the discovery said. The London bookdealers had only owned it for a short time, having bought it from World War I pilot Air Vice Marshal Maynard, whoíd inherited it from two leading campaigners against the slave trade.

ìThe provenance of this document is just fantastic,î Vincent said in the press release. ìGiven where it is, given present problems over liberties, over the sense of constitutional tradition in America, you couldnít invent a provenance that was more wonderful than this.î

Multiple tell-tale signs initially gave away the documentís authenticity, Carpenter said, including the style of handwriting and the big ìEî at the start of the first line ñ which stands for ìEdwardus.î

The documentís dimensions at 48.9 centimeters (19.3 inches) by 47.3 centimeters (18.6 inches) were also consistent with those found in the six previously known?originals.

Later, ultraviolet images and other images provided by Harvard Law School were used to ìmatch upî the text of the new document to the other originals, Carpenter said.

ìThat made me convinced that it was indeed authentic,î Carpenter added.

So, what will happen to the document now?

Both academics are due to visit Harvard in June for a celebration to mark the discovery of the medieval document. After that, Carpenter believes that it will be put on public display as ìone of the jewels in the crownî of Harvardís collection.",15-May-25,Health,Billy Stockwell,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/15/science/magna-carta-harvard-law-school-scli-intl,,,,,,,,,,,,‚Äúcopy‚Äù magna carta bought decades ago harvard law school just now understood extremely rare original according new research british historians able verify document‚Äôs true authenticity academic stumbled across item looking harvard law school‚Äôs online archives ‚Äúi just working home‚Ä¶ looking unofficial copies magna carta finding quite lot them‚Äù david carpenter professor medieval history king‚Äôs college london told cnn thursday recounting moment made discovery ‚Äúi finally came harvard law school manuscript number clicked expecting see statute book saw‚Ä¶ original magna carta‚Äù carpenter said shocked discovery academic said quickly contacted nicholas vincent professor medieval history university east anglia fellow ‚Äúmagna carta pundit‚Äù ‚Äúi said ‚Äòis think is‚Äô said ‚Äòyeah think too‚Äô‚Äù carpenter recounted magna carta great charter often regarded earliest declaration human rights credited enshrining rights man english law according united kingdom‚Äôs parliament website charter first ‚Äúto put writing principle king government law‚Äù today revered around world document established principle everyone ‚Äì including monarch ‚Äì subject rule law ‚Äúhe king couldn‚Äôt just say ‚Äòoff head prison i‚Äôm seizing property‚Äô wanted act due legal process‚Äù carpenter said academics believe harvard document one just seven king edward i‚Äôs issue magna carta still survive imaging technology used help librarians examine faded copy magna carta cambridge massachusetts imaging technology used help librarians examine faded copy magna carta cambridge massachusetts debora mayerharvard weissman centerap amanda watson harvard law school‚Äôs assistant dean library services congratulated work british academics ‚Äúfantastic discovery‚Äù added new research ‚Äúexemplifies happens magnificent collections like harvard law library‚Äôs opened brilliant scholars‚Äù harvard‚Äôs law school library bought document via auction london bookdealers sweet maxwell according accession register auction catalogue described manuscript ‚Äúcopy‚Ä¶made ‚Ä¶ somewhat rubbed dampstained‚Äù press release announcing discovery said london bookdealers owned short time bought world war pilot air vice marshal maynard who‚Äôd inherited two leading campaigners slave trade ‚Äúthe provenance document just fantastic‚Äù vincent said press release ‚Äúgiven given present problems liberties sense constitutional tradition america couldn‚Äôt invent provenance wonderful this‚Äù multiple telltale signs initially gave away document‚Äôs authenticity carpenter said including style handwriting big ‚Äúe‚Äù start first line ‚Äì stands ‚Äúedwardus‚Äù handout photo issued just stop oil judy bruce retired biology teacher swansea reverend sue parfitt bristol targeted protective enclosure around historic magna carta document hammer chisel friday morning british museum london picture date friday may related article just stop oil supporters including yearold priest smash glass surrounding britain‚Äôs historic magna carta document‚Äôs dimensions centimeters inches centimeters inches also consistent found six previously knownoriginals later ultraviolet images images provided harvard law school used ‚Äúmatch up‚Äù text new document originals carpenter said ‚Äúthat made convinced indeed authentic‚Äù carpenter added happen document now academics due visit harvard june celebration mark discovery medieval document carpenter believes put public display ‚Äúone jewels crown‚Äù harvard‚Äôs collection
Once dead thrusters on the farthest spacecraft from Earth are in action again,"Engineers at NASA say they have successfully revived thrusters aboard Voyager 1, the farthest spacecraft from our planet, in the nick of time before a planned communications blackout.

A side effect of upgrades to an Earth-based antenna that sends commands to Voyager 1 and its twin, Voyager 2, the communications pause could have occurred when the probe faced a critical issue ó thruster failure ó leaving the space agency without a way to save the historic mission. The new fix to the vehicleís original roll thrusters, out of action since 2004, could help keep the veteran spacecraft operating until itís able to contact home again next year.

Voyager 1, launched in September 1977, uses more than one set of thrusters to function properly. Primary thrusters carefully orient the spacecraft so it can keep its antenna pointed at Earth. This ensures that the probe can send back data it collects from its unique perspective 15.5 billion miles (25 billion kilometers) away in interstellar space, as well as receive commands sent by the Voyager team.

Within the primary set are additional thrusters that control the spacecraftís roll, which enables Voyager 1 to remain pointed at a guide star so it can remain oriented in space.

If Voyager canít control its roll motion, the mission could be threatened.

But as the thrusters fire, tiny amounts of propellant residue have built up over time. So far, engineers have managed to avoid clogging by commanding Voyager 1 to cycle between its original and backup thrusters for orientation, as well as a set of thrusters that were used to change the spacecraftís trajectory during planetary flybys in the 1980s. The trajectory thrusters, however, do nothing to contribute to the spacecraftís roll.

A failed Soviet-era spacecraft has likely crashed back to Earth

Voyager 1ís original roll thrusters stopped working more than two decades ago after power was lost in two internal heaters, which means the spacecraft has been relying on the backup roll thrusters to remain pointed at a guide star ever since.

ìI think at that time, the team was OK with accepting that the primary roll thrusters didnít work, because they had a perfectly good backup,î said Kareem Badaruddin, Voyager mission manager at NASAís Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, in a statement. ìAnd, frankly, they probably didnít think the Voyagers were going to keep going for another 20 years.î

Now, Voyager 1 engineers are concerned that clogging from the residue could cause the spacecraftís backup roll thrusters to stop working as soon as this fall ó and they had to get creative, as well as take risks, to revive the long-defunct primary roll thrusters.

When the heaters on the primary roll thrusters failed in 2004, engineers thought they couldnít be fixed. But with the threat posed by clogging looming, the team returned to the drawing board to see what had gone wrong.

Engineers considered the possibility that a disturbance in the circuits controlling the power supply to the heaters flipped a switch to the wrong position ó and flipping it to the original position might restart the heaters, and in turn, the primary roll thrusters.

But it wasnít a straightforward solution for a probe thatís operating so far away. The spacecraft is currently beyond the heliosphere, the sunís bubble of magnetic fields and particles that extends well beyond the orbit of Pluto.

The mission team had to take a risk by switching Voyager 1 to its primary roll thrusters and turning them on before attempting to fix and restart the heaters. The heaters could only function if the thrusters are also switched on.

If Voyager 1 drifted too far from its guide star, the spacecraftís programming would trigger the roll thrusters to fire ó but if the heaters werenít turned on yet at that moment, the automatic sequence could have triggered a small explosion.

A nail-biting test
In addition to the risk, the team, which began its work earlier this year, was facing a time constraint. A giant Earth-based antenna in Canberra, Australia, went offline May 4 for upgrades that will be ongoing until February 2026. NASAís Deep Space Network enables the agency to communicate with all of its spacecraft ó but its Canberra antenna is the only one with enough signal strength to send commands to the Voyager probes.

ìThese antenna upgrades are important for future crewed lunar landings, and they also increase communications capacity for our science missions in deep space, some of which are building on the discoveries Voyager made,î said Suzanne Dodd, Voyager project manager and director of the Interplanetary Network at JPL, which manages the Deep Space Network for NASA, in a statement. ìWeíve been through downtime like this before, so weíre just preparing as much as we can.î

While the antenna will briefly operate in August and December, the mission team members wanted to command Voyager 1 to test its long-dormant thrusters before they could no longer communicate with the spacecraft. This way, if they need to turn on the thrusters in August, the team would know whether that was a viable option.

On March 20, the team waited to see the results return from Voyager 1 after sending a command to the probe the day before to activate the thrusters and heaters. It takes more than 23 hours for data to travel back from Voyager 1 to Earth due to the sheer distance between the two.

Had the test failed, Voyager 1 may have already been at risk. But the team watched the data stream in, showing the temperature of the thruster heaters rising dramatically, and knew it had worked.

ìIt was such a glorious moment. Team morale was very high that day,î said Todd Barber, the missionís propulsion lead at JPL, in a statement. ìThese thrusters were considered dead. And that was a legitimate conclusion. Itís just that one of our engineers had this insight that maybe there was this other possible cause and it was fixable.

"Ancient poetry unveils hidden history of critically endangered finless porpoises, scientists say","CNN
 ó 
A research team in China got creative in its efforts to save a critically endangered species by turning to ancient poems. The scientists pored over more than 700 ancient Chinese poems from the Tang through the Qing dynasties that mention the Yangtze finless porpoise to find out where and when poets described seeing the animal because little is known about its population history.

The Yangtze finless porpoise ó the worldís only freshwater porpoise ó has faced extreme declines in numbers in the past four decades. With fewer than 1,300 individuals left in the wild, scientists in eastern China have made huge efforts to better understand the animalís past habitat range to better inform future conservation initiatives.

The findings were stark: The data suggests that the historic range of the finless porpoise has shrunk by 65% over the past 1,200 years, with the most extreme reduction happening over the past century. The team published the findings in the journal Current Biology on May 5.

ìSome older fishers told me they used to frequently see porpoises in areas where theyíve now disappeared completely,î study coauthor Zhigang Mei told CNN in an email. ìThat really sparked my curiosity: Where did these porpoises historically live?î

Yangtze finless porpoises only live in the middle-lower Yangtze River basin in eastern China. From the early 1980s until the 2010s, the population steeply declined an estimated 60%, according to a 2014 study, due to a combination of illegal fishing practices, industrial pollution in waterways, dams and sand mining in the adjoining lakes.

Because hard scientific data for the porpoise only exists for recent decades, scientists have a very narrow understanding of its spatial distribution. This creates a problem known as shifting baseline syndrome, explained Mei, a professor at the Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in Wuhan.

ì(This research) answers important questions about what constitutes a healthy population,î he said, which will help with setting realistic management goals. ìWithout historical baselines, there is a risk of shifting expectations downward over generations, accepting an ever-declining status as ënormal.íî

Playing with poems
When Mei and his colleagues started poking around archives for answers, they were surprised. Official records such as local gazettes and county chronicles didnít have any information about the porpoises ó only terrestrial megafauna like tigers and elephants, species that have frequent conflict with humans.

A Ming Dynasty poem from ìCompendium of the Three Powers,î compiled by Wang Qi (1573ñ1620), records the Yangtze finless porpoise's morphological details, surfacing postures and rearing behaviors.

Porpoises, in contrast, are less likely to have close encounters with humans. (No drama, no record.) Instead, sightings were typically by local, less-educated anglers or wealthy travelers ó who caught glimpses of the elusive porpoises while traveling the Yangtze River by boat ó and werenít formally recorded, Mei said.

Facing this dead end, the scientists realized ancient poems could come in handy.

ìWe were amazed,î Mei said of the researchers efforts to explore written documentation via literature.

The authors sorted through hundreds of poems dating back to AD 830 that referenced porpoises. For each poem, the scientists looked for evidence of locations, such as descriptions of unique geographical features of the Yangtze River basin. Then, the team researched the poemís time period and each poetsí personal history to ensure their accuracy. About half of the poems contained precise location information, allowing the team to map sightings for each dynasty.

Ancient Chinese poetry is often nonfiction, including first-person accounts of everyday life and observations of nature, the authors explained. Thatís why the poems served as a reasonable metric for finless porpoise sightings throughout the river basin.

ìEmerald seals the jade-green tiles as idle dawn clouds drift / Specks of porpoises vanish between the wavesí swift lift,î reads one Qing Dynasty poem by Gu SilÏ ??? called ìCrossing the River in Rain, Looking at Jinshan,î as translated by lead study author Yaoyao Zhang, an ecologist at the Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

ìItís beautiful, actually,î said Paulo Corti, a conservation ecologist at Austral University of Chile who was not involved in the research. ìThey did something great with some very simple information.î

Using historic materials for science isnít uncommon ó especially in paleontology or archaeology ó but itís less often used for wildlife research, Corti said.

ìItís a very useful tool, especially when you refine the analysis, taking those qualitative data into quantitative (data),î he said.

Using literature as data
The poetry data only offers an estimate. However, itís the study authorsí best source for formulating how the Yangtze finless porpoise populationís distribution changed before modern times.

Such studies need to be conducted carefully, adds Corti, who has written journal articles about responsibly using historical records for wildlife studies after noticing that some scientists were using such data inappropriately.

One major limitation of cultural records is human error, he explained. A fisherman or hunter, for example, is a more reliable observer than a foreign explorer likely to misidentify similar-looking animals. Thatís why the study authors researched each poetís background, such as where they lived and traveled, to verify their observations.

The Yangtze finless porpoise looks distinct, with a short snout, dark gray color and signature lack of a dorsal fin, which sets it apart from its dolphin relatives.

As mammals, porpoises need to surface for air, making them visible to humans, said study coauthor Jiajia Liu, a professor of biodiversity science at Fudan University in Shanghai. And because finless porpoises did not historically hold cultural importance, it was less likely for poets to write about them without a literal observation, he added.

For these reasons, the researchers trusted the poems for data.

That said, the authors acknowledge that some historical references of the river porpoise could be confused with the now-extinct baiji, a freshwater dolphin that lived in the Yangtze. But this species was much bigger, lighter-colored, and touted a long snout ó its most distinguishing feature, Mei said.

Conservation goals
Indeed, the baiji serves as a cautionary tale for the finless porpoise. The freshwater dolphin already became functionally extinct in 2006 from many of the same threats.

Extinction of the finless porpoise would throw the ecosystem out of balance, Liu explained. As a top predator, the porpoise eats fish that feed on aquatic grasses. The rare mammal is also an ecosystem engineer by facilitating a process called nutrient cycling. By migrating long distances, the finless porpoise carries nitrogen and phosphorus from the river bottom to its surface, and from downstream to upstream.

Now that there is some evidence that the finless porpoise lived not only in the main river, but also in tributaries and lakes, scientists have a better idea of where the porpoise historically thrived ó and whether it might thrive in those locations once again.

With captive breeding ó a process in which endangered species are bred in captivity and released back into the wild ó underway since 1996, the authors hope their new findings may help inform future conservation efforts, such as identifying areas where they can be released.

But itís important not to jump to conclusions, Corti warned. Using such information for modern-day wildlife management requires a thorough understanding of species behavior, morphology, diet and other factors, he said. ìYou can make a lot of mistakesî extrapolating historic observational data to inform future management decisions, he added.

ìIf you are trying to see what happened with the species in the past, you need to know what is going on now,î Corti said.

Importantly, Mei noted, this study creates a link between endangered species and culture, which could attract public attention. If the Yangtze finless porpoise can be a flagship species, such as the panda, it will help improve their conservation, he said.

Over the past few years, the porpoise population increased for the first time, thanks in part to conservation policies such as fishing bans.

ìConservation is not only (for) scientists,î Mei said. ìItís about everyone, itís about our culture.î

Beyoncs mom talks about the choices she made while raising her daughters,"Tina Knowles remembers growing up in a loving and raucous family of nine. She was the youngest of seven children. Add in her cousins, and they were a force to be reckoned with whenever they left the house.

At a very early age, Knowles says she was taught not to draw any attention to herself. ìPretty is as pretty does,î her mom used to say.

In other words, be quiet, know your place.

Lucky for us all, she didnít listen. On a book tour for her new memoir, ìMatriarch,î an Oprahís Book Club selection, she talked to me at CNNís offices in New York about what she learned from her own childhood and her choices while raising her daughters, BeyoncÈ and Solange Knowles.

CNN
On Motherís Day weekend, hereís what the businesswoman, fashion designer and mother of two of the most famous entertainers in the world wanted to share.

Donít limit your children
Teaching kids to be seen and not heard was a common way of parenting back when ìMama Tinaî was growing up in Galveston, Texas, during segregation. Her mom, her teachers at her Catholic school and all the adults around her made clear what role she was expected to play.


To Knowles, that translated into trying to make herself small and insignificant ó even though she was born with a big personality, big feelings and many opinions. But Knowles simply couldnít follow the quiet rule and was quickly given a nickname: ìBadass Tenie B.î

ìThat was not a term of endearment when I was little,î Knowles told me in a recent conversation. ìThey used to just say, here comes that Badass Tenie B because I was hyper, I talked back.î Now, she says she recognizes her willfulness and hyper behavior stemmed from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. Which, she reflects, ìwasnít a thing then.î

Knowles attended a school where nuns ruled the roost. She said there were teachers who told her she didnít belong, that she was unsalvageable and a bad seed. The words punctured her soul and made her hate going to school.

ìThey thought they were doing the best thing,î Knowles said, but it hurt terribly.


She would run home to tell her mother and could not understand why her mom would never take her side. She didnít know her mother was working herself to the bone for the church to get Knowles and her siblings an education.

From her own experience at school and in her childhood community, Knowles said itís so important to really think about what you are saying to children. Labels can affect them for a lifetime.

ìI still fight with that sometimes,î she said, ìand Iím 71 years old. Itís in the back of my head: Donít bring too much attention to yourself. Itís OK if somebody else takes credit for what you did.î


Those words still cut, so she advises parents to do things differently. ìAdvocate for your kids. You have to protect your kids,î Knowles said. ìMake sure that the messages that theyíre giving your kids are ones that they can do anything they want to do and they do belong anywhere that they want to be.î

Itís exactly the message she imparted to her girls.

Pay attention to how you treat yourself

Your children are watching how you treat yourself, Knowles told me, noting that her loving mother, AgnÈz BeyincÈ, lived life in fear for her children as she tried to make sure they were not targets in the segregated US South.

But Knowles also watched her mother make exquisite outfits for all of her kids, and they were the best-dressed kids in town even though they were poor. (Knowles learned great lessons from her motherís work as a seamstress and ended up creating most of the outfits for Destinyís Child, Beyonceís singing group with Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams.)


ìAs poor as we were, we were always the sharpest kids and just took a lot of pride in fashion and how we looked and Ö I think it helped us not to know how poor we were,î Knowles said. ìI passed it on to my daughters Ö theyíre very talented at putting things together. They donít sew like I sew but they can put a button on, and they can put a hem in and take a dart in and that type of thing.î

Work against sibling rivalry
Knowles says she knew right away that BeyoncÈ had found her lifeís passion the first time she saw her daughter onstage. It was that obvious. But Knowles said her younger daughter could have done anything, and she didnít really want Solange to go into the music business.

ìI was terrified when BeyoncÈ turned around 10,î said Knowles, worried sheíd lose her children to their craft and that the work would create a wedge between the sisters.

According to Knowles, the kids in BeyoncÈís singing group would say to Solange every day, ìëBe quiet, Solange,í because she would try to choreograph (the group). You know sheís bossy, and she wanted to be involved.î


ìI started noticing that BeyoncÈ would allow them to talk to her like that,î she said. ìI saw a wall between them coming, and so I got them in therapy.î

While her family and community thought therapy could be problematic or even dangerous, she found a ìwonderfulî child therapist. As a result, the two sisters ìare now as close as they can be. No wedge will come between them.î

Knowles encourages other parents to do the same if they see an unhealthy sibling rivalry developing between your children.

Get screened for breast cancer
Knowles got diagnosed with breast cancer last year, and she struggled with the decision to mention it publicly or not. She decided to speak out so other people would also get screened, especially if theyíve missed a checkup or two or more.


ìYou get busy doing everything for everyone else,î she said, ìand everything else takes a priority over your health at some point in our lives, I think (for) women in particular, but men as well.î

ìI want to share it in hopes that that women would take a minute and say Ö Iím gonna go,î she added."," May 11, 2025",Health,Sara Sidner,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/11/health/tina-knowles-mother-wellness,,,,,,,,,,,,tina knowles remembers growing loving raucous family nine youngest seven children add cousins force reckoned whenever left house early age knowles says taught draw attention ‚Äúpretty pretty does‚Äù mom used say words quiet know place lucky us didn‚Äôt listen book tour new memoir ‚Äúmatriarch‚Äù oprah‚Äôs book club selection talked cnn‚Äôs offices new york learned childhood choices raising daughters beyonc√© solange knowles cnn mother‚Äôs day weekend here‚Äôs businesswoman fashion designer mother two famous entertainers world wanted share don‚Äôt limit children teaching kids seen heard common way parenting back ‚Äúmama tina‚Äù growing galveston texas segregation mom teachers catholic school adults around made clear role expected play knowles translated trying make small insignificant ‚Äî even though born big personality big feelings many opinions knowles simply couldn‚Äôt follow quiet rule quickly given nickname ‚Äúbadass tenie b‚Äù ‚Äúthat term endearment little‚Äù knowles told recent conversation ‚Äúthey used just say comes badass tenie b hyper talked back‚Äù now says recognizes willfulness hyper behavior stemmed attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd reflects ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt thing then‚Äù child tina knowles attended catholic school teachers negatively shaped view school child tina knowles attended catholic school teachers negatively shaped view school courtesy tina knowlespenguin random house knowles attended school nuns ruled roost said teachers told didn‚Äôt belong unsalvageable bad seed words punctured soul made hate going school ‚Äúthey thought best thing‚Äù knowles said hurt terribly run home tell mother understand mom never take side didn‚Äôt know mother working bone church get knowles siblings education experience school childhood community knowles said it‚Äôs important really think saying children labels can affect lifetime related article santa claus putting gifts christmas tree night use positive reinforcement instead threats child‚Äôs misbehavior experts say ‚Äúi still fight sometimes‚Äù said ‚Äúand i‚Äôm years old it‚Äôs back head don‚Äôt bring much attention it‚Äôs ok somebody else takes credit did‚Äù words still cut advises parents things differently ‚Äúadvocate kids protect kids‚Äù knowles said ‚Äúmake sure messages they‚Äôre giving kids ones can anything want belong anywhere want be‚Äù it‚Äôs exactly message imparted girls pay attention treat knowles talented seamstress continues follow fashion wearing gucci attends lacma artfilm gala los angeles november knowles talented seamstress continues follow fashion wearing gucci attends lacma artfilm gala los angeles november matt winkelmeyergetty images children watching treat knowles told noting loving mother agn√©z beyinc√© lived life fear children tried make sure targets segregated us south knowles also watched mother make exquisite outfits kids bestdressed kids town even though poor knowles learned great lessons mother‚Äôs work seamstress ended creating outfits destiny‚Äôs child beyonce‚Äôs singing group kelly rowland michelle williams ‚Äúas poor always sharpest kids just took lot pride fashion looked ‚Ä¶ think helped us know poor were‚Äù knowles said ‚Äúi passed daughters ‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre talented putting things together don‚Äôt sew like sew can put button can put hem take dart type thing‚Äù work sibling rivalry knowles says knew right away beyonc√© found life‚Äôs passion first time saw daughter onstage obvious knowles said younger daughter done anything didn‚Äôt really want solange go music business solange l beyonc√© perform onstage coachella valley music arts festival april solange l beyonc√© perform onstage coachella valley music arts festival april kevin mazurgetty images ‚Äúi terrified beyonc√© turned around ‚Äù said knowles worried she‚Äôd lose children craft work create wedge sisters according knowles kids beyonc√©‚Äôs singing group say solange every day ‚Äú‚Äòbe quiet solange‚Äô try choreograph group know she‚Äôs bossy wanted involved‚Äù ‚Äúi started noticing beyonc√© allow talk like that‚Äù said ‚Äúi saw wall coming got therapy‚Äù family community thought therapy problematic even dangerous found ‚Äúwonderful‚Äù child therapist result two sisters ‚Äúare now close can wedge come them‚Äù knowles encourages parents see unhealthy sibling rivalry developing children get screened breast cancer knowles got diagnosed breast cancer last year struggled decision mention publicly decided speak people also get screened especially they‚Äôve missed checkup two ‚Äúyou get busy everything everyone else‚Äù said ‚Äúand everything else takes priority health point lives think women particular men well‚Äù ‚Äúi want share hopes women take minute say ‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm gonna go‚Äù added
Did 8 Italian physicists make the perfect cacio e pepe? I tested their experiment to find out,"Few things are as impressive to dinner party guests as a perfectly executed ‡ la minute pasta dish.

As a Roman-born foodie, I would argue that cacio e pepe, a Roman pasta recipe that is as delicious and simple as it is finicky, is a bold menu choice for the novice cook.

The name says it all: pasta, cacio (cheese) and pepe (pepper). Thatís it. Thatís the recipe.

ìThere is no margin for error with just pasta, Pecorino Romano cheese, and black pepper,î Michele Casadei Massari, CEO and executive chef of Lucciola Italian Restaurant in Manhattan, told CNN via email.

ìThe main challenge lies in achieving a stable emulsion: If the cheese is overheated or the starch-water balance is wrong, the sauce will separate,î Massari said.

When that happens, the pecorino forms a gloopy cheesy mess, sticking to everything but the noodles ó sad and naked.


So, how can one reliably avoid unpleasant dinnertime disasters? Either by practicing a lot ó and inevitably making mistakes in the process, as I have ó or by using science to guide the way.

Eight Italian physicists collaborated to crack the code of a foolproof cacio e pepe recipe, studying the properties of cheese, starch and water at different temperatures to learn how to replicate a flawless dish every time.

When I first heard about the method, the Roman cuisine purist in me was skeptical.

Too many times, Iíve read cheat sheets for the perfect carbonara dish in which the solution to perfect, non-scrambled-egg sauce is to add cream (please, do not do this). In the interest of objectivity, I had to test the recipe myself and talk to these fellow Italians behind the research.

In a conversation in Italian, three of the study authors shared that the research came from their frustration for one too many cacio e pepe dishes gone wrong. Thanks to the groupís familiarity with the concept of ìliquid-liquid phase separation,î they knew how to investigate the problem scientifically.

ìAt some point, the eight of us were all at the Max Planck Institute in Dresden (Germany), some as PhD students, some as postdocs,î said study coauthor Daniel Maria Busiello, a statistical physicist at Italyís University of Padova. At that time, ìsomething weíd often do was cooking Italian recipes, not just for Italians, but for others as well.î

Making big batches of cacio e pepe to feed other hungry scientists turned out to be a near-impossible feat. ìThere were problems with controlling the temperature of the sauce and of the noodles, causing these clumps,î Busiello said.

ìI remember a time the dish came out inedible. Something clicked then,î said study coauthor Ivan Di Terlizzi, one of the groupís top cooks, and a statistical physicist at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden.

The physics of a pasta problem
Di Terlizzi approached fellow researcher Giacomo Bartolucci, now a biophysicist at the University of Barcelona in Spain, with a working theory about possible commonalities between the behavior of cacio e pepe sauce and that of aqueous solutions of proteins inside cells. Bartolucci had focused on phase separation and the aggregation of proteins for his doctoral research.

The scientists set out to understand whether the cheese and water in this recipe could be scientifically described as ìa system that undergoes phase separation at high temperatures,î in Busielloís words.

ìWe had a theoretical framework and a practical problem,î Busiello added.

Innovating on traditional Italian recipes, even on solid scientific grounds, is a high-risk endeavor. Given the touchy subject, the study authors are of course all Italians, by design.

ìIf we have to piss off a bunch of people, at least let it be eight Italians who did it,î Di Terlizzi said.

To investigate the behavior of cacio e pepe sauce under heat, the researchers conducted experiments recreating the cooking process in a controlled setup.

ìWe prepared small batches of sauce using precise amounts of cheese, starch, and water, and gradually heated them using a sous vide device to carefully control the temperature,î Di Terlizzi explained.

ìAt each stage, we took a small sample of the sauce, placed it in a petri dish and photographed it from above to observe how clumps formed. This allowed us to track how changes in temperature and ingredients affected the smoothness of the sauce.î

Avoiding the ëMozzarella phaseí
The researchers found that the concentration of starch in the sauce is the key factor influencing its stability. If the proportion of starch falls below 1% of the total cheese weight, the cheese will enter what the authors call the ìMozzarella phaseî ó in which clumps are inescapable and the dish is ruined ó at lower temperatures. A 2% to 3% starch-to-cheese ratio yields the best results.

In the recipe for two published in the study, the researchers used 5 grams (0.18 ounce) of cornstarch or potato starch dissolved in water, heated up gently to form a gel, then cooled down with more water before being blended with 200 grams (7 ounces) of pecorino cheese.

Sodium citrate, a common additive used to make smooth mac and cheese, also worked well in their recipe, although according to Di Terlizzi it lent the dish a slightly ìcheese singleî aftertaste.

The scientifically engineered pecorino cream can withstand temperature changes better than the classic cheese-starchy water mixture made with pasta cooking water and can even be reheated.

Temperature is in fact another key factor that can make or break the sauce, which has to do with how the proteins in the cheese behave when heated.

Writer Francesca Giuliani Hoffman said the more stable, smooth sauce in the scientifically optimized recipe she prepared at home meant the final mixing of the ingredients was less time-sensitive.

ìThe sauce is stable if created at low temperatures and the starch bonded with the proteins. If, after that happens, you expose the sauce to high temperatures, proteins can no longer interact,î Di Terlizzi said.

If the emulsion of cheese and starch happens at high temperatures though, ìthereís no guarantee that proteins will bond with other proteins, which causes the aggregation, before they bond with the starch.î

The scientifically optimized recipe will yield solid results for large batches of pasta, as the stable sauce will give you more flexibility dealing with a large volume of piping hot noodles, cooling down more slowly than a smaller batch of pasta would.

When trying the scientifically optimized recipe, donít throw away all the pasta cooking water! Youíll still need some of it in the final mixing of all ingredients (the ìmantecaturaî in Italian). Just be careful to let it cool down slightly.

Testing the physicistsí recipe
When I tested the recipe, the instructions felt straightforward, and the process was quick, though it required a few more steps than what Iím used to (such as forming the starch gel on the stove).

It was frankly odd to work with a pecorino cream that felt so smooth ó it almost reminded me of a jarred sauce. Nothing changes as far as the pepper goes. Just crack as much of it as youíd like and toast it in a pan to release its aroma.

My husband and I enjoyed the dish. It tasted great, and dealing with a pecorino cream that needs much less babying at the stove and allows for a much less time-sensitive mantecatura is a definite plus. Also, who doesnít love the idea of a cacio e pepe party for a crowd?

My only qualm is that knowing there was starch added in the sauce, my perception of the dishís mouthfeel was definitely skewed, but that wasnít the case for my husband.

As a proud Roman home cook, my pursuit of a perfect classic cacio e pepe will be a life-long experiment, but the scientifically optimized recipe exceeded my expectations and would be a good initiation for home cooks who have been put off by the dishís treachery thus far.

A chefís advice for the traditional dish
But what exactly makes the traditional way of making this dish, by emulsifying the cheese with pasta cooking water, so challenging?

Itís practically impossible to know just how much starch is naturally present in the pasta cooking water, so the success of the crucial emulsion is more of a gamble, but there are tricks to mitigate catastrophe.

One, coming from Massari, is to use less water to boil the pasta.

ìFor cacio e pepe, I recommend using about 6 to 8 cups of water for 7 ounces of pasta, which translates to a ratio closer to 1 part pasta to 6ñ7 parts water by weight ó significantly less than in traditional pasta cooking,î the chef said.

A classic rule of thumb for cooking pasta, according to Massari, is to use about 1 quart of water for every 3Ω ounces of pasta, and 2 teaspoons of salt.

The researchers, who used an arbitrary 10-to-1 ratio of water to pasta in their experiments, also said that reducing that volume of water by two-thirds generally concentrated the natural pasta starch to a safe degree.

Massari also recommends emulsifying the cheese and pasta water below 60 degrees Celsius (140 degrees Fahrenheit), which is in line with the new studyís findings on temperature.

ìI first create a cold cheese cream, using finely grated Pecorino and a small amount of the pastaís starchy cooking water, blending until smooth. Then, I toss the pasta off the heat with the cream and freshly cracked black pepper, adding extra water to adjust the texture,î Massari said. ìThe result should be a silky, cohesive sauce that clings beautifully to every strand of pasta, not a broken or heavy coating.î

ìThe natural starch from properly handled pasta is more than sufficient to achieve a creamy, stable, and authentic sauce without compromising the nutritional integrity of the dish,î Massari added.

Another chefís trick to buy you some time while attempting the recipe the traditional way is ìpasta regenerationî ó which involves partially cooking the pasta for about 70% of its time, immediately shocking it in ice water to stop gelatinization and finishing it later before serving.

ìThis method preserves al dente texture while enhancing the final release of surface starch, which is crucial for stabilizing delicate emulsions,î Massari explained.

Celebrating with their tested recipe
The researchers said their scientifically optimized recipe has surged to meme status, online and offline.

ìSome social media users were hypercritical about the recipe we proposed, despite it being used before in prestigious restaurants,î Di Terlizzi told CNN. ìOverall, I can say that excitement prevailed, especially in the scientific community,î he added.

ìWe wonít say we invented the definitive method,î Di Terlizzi said, but this method will save you from ruining good, expensive and hard-to-source pecorino cheese.

For the researchers, thatís personal: ìWeíre in Germany. We have that shipped to us all the way from Italy. We canít just buy it at the store every day,î Di Terlizzi said. ìSo, when the dish turns out badly, that bothers us.î

A big pasta dinner celebrated the publication of the paper, with the researchers preparing at least 4 pounds of pasta for a crowd.

ìWe were on pins and needles because our diners all knew about the experiment ó but it worked perfectly,î Busiello said.

Bartolucci added, ìThat was our trial by fire.î

The scientifically optimized cacio e pepe recipe we tested
This is CNNís summary of the recipe presented in the study. You can find Pecorino Romano DOP ó which stands for Protected Designation of Origin, a certification of a productís origin and quality assigned by the Italian government and the European Union ó and tonnarelli pasta at Italian grocers and online specialty stores.

Serves 2

Ingredients

ï Salt

ï 5 grams (2 teaspoons) cracked black peppercorns, plus more for serving

ï 5 grams (2 teaspoons) cornstarch or potato starch

ï 200 grams (1 Ω cups, firmly packed) pregrated Pecorino Romano DOP (such as Fulvi, Locatelli or Cello), plus more for serving

ï 300 grams (10.6 ounces) pasta, preferably tonnarelli (spaghetti or rigatoni also work well)

Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.

2. While the water comes to a boil, add peppercorns in a single layer to a dry pan over medium-low heat. Toast until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove pepper from heat immediately.

3. Make the starch gel. In a small saucepan, dissolve the cornstarch by whisking it into 50 grams (3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon) cold water. Heat the mixture gently over low heat until it thickens and turns nearly clear. Remove the starch gel from heat and whisk in 100 grams (6 æ tablespoons) water to cool. The mixture will return to a liquid state.

4. Make the pecorino cream. Add the starchy water, grated cheese and peppercorns to the bowl of a food processor and pulse to combine until a smooth cream forms.

5. Cook the pasta according to the package directions until al dente, reserving 237 milliliters (1 cup) of pasta water before draining. Drain the pasta and let cool for up to 1 minute.

6. Mix the pasta with the sauce, ensuring even coating, and adjust the consistency by gradually adding pasta water as needed. Keep the sauce slightly runny as it tends to thicken as it cools. If needed, the dish can withstand gentle reheating (up to 80 or 90 C, 176 to 194 F) to reach serving temperature.

7. Sprinkle with additional grated cheese and pepper and serve immediately.

ìI recommend using high-quality spaghettoni pasta made from durum wheat semolina, bronze-extruded and slow-dried at low temperatures,î Massari told CNN. ìI prefer using Matt, a heritage durum wheat cultivated mainly in Puglia and Sicily.î

You can find matt spaghettoni, Sarawak black peppercorns and Pecorino Romano DOP at online specialty stores.

Serves 2

Ingredients

ï Sea salt, preferably coarse Sicilian sea salt

ï 5 grams (1 teaspoon) freshly cracked Sarawak black peppercorns, plus more for serving

ï 100 grams (1 cup, firmly packed) pregrated Pecorino Romano DOP (such as Fulvi, Locatelli or Cello), plus more for serving

ï 200 grams (7 ounces) spaghettoni, preferably matt durum wheat spaghettoni

Directions

1. Bring 6 to 8 cups of lightly salted water to a boil in a large pot. Toast the black pepper in a dry pan over medium-low heat until fragrant. Remove pepper from heat immediately.

2. Cook the spaghettoni according to the package directions until slightly al dente, reserving 237 grams (1 cup) of cooking liquid while itís cooking.

3. While the pasta is cooking, prepare a cold emulsion by mixing grated Pecorino Romano with a small ladle of warm pasta water (ideally under 60 C, or 140 F) in a medium bowl until it forms a creamy base.

4. Drain the pasta slightly al dente, then transfer it to the pan with the pepper.

5. Toss the pasta with the Pecorino cream, gradually adjusting with more pasta water to create a glossy, smooth sauce that perfectly coats the noodles. Add more black pepper and cheese before serving.

Parkinsons disease prevention may begin at the dinner table,"Eating about a dozen servings of ultraprocessed food each day could more than double your risk of developing Parkinsonís disease, according to a new study.

A single serving in the study was 8 ounces of diet or sugar-sweetened soda, a single hot dog, one slice of packaged cake, a mere tablespoon of ketchup or 1 ounce of potato chips ó a typical small bag of chips is 1.5 ounces.

Eating more ultraprocessed food ups the risk of premature death, study finds

ìOur research shows that eating too much processed food, like sugary sodas and packaged snacks, might be speeding up early signs of Parkinsonís disease,î said senior study author Dr. Xiang Gao, a distinguished professor and dean of the Institute of Nutrition at Fudan University in Shanghai, China, in a statement.

This latest study is part of the ìgrowing evidence that diet might influence the development of Parkinsonís disease,î Gao said.


While the study found that people who ate more ultraprocessed foods tended to report more early symptoms, it did not find a direct increase in the risk of Parkinsonís disease itself, said Dr. Daniel van Wamelen, a clinical senior lecturer in neuroscience at Kingís College London. He was not involved in the new research.

ìThe study did not track whether participants were diagnosed with Parkinsonís later on,î van Wamelen said in a statement. ìThat said, having more of these symptoms suggests a higher risk over time.î

Brain health begins ëat the dinner tableí
The study analyzed years of health and diet data on nearly 43,000 participants of the Nursesí Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, two studies in the United States that have been gathering information on health behaviors for decades. The average age of people in the study was 48, and none had Parkinsonís disease at the beginning of the study. All self-reported what they ate every few years ó a limitation of the new research as participants may not have remembered their food intake accurately.

Ultraprocessed foods measured by the study included artificially or sugar-sweetened beverages; condiments, sauces and spreads; packaged sweets snacks or desserts; yogurt or dairy-based desserts; breads and cereals; and packaged savory snacks.


The study found a link between early signs of Parkinsonís disease and all types of ultraprocessed foods except breads and cereals ó a finding that indicates an underlying feature among most classes of ultraprocessed foods that may explain the results, the study said.

One reason could be ultraprocessed foods typically have less dietary fiber, protein and micronutrients ó but do have added sugar, salt, and saturated or trans fats, the study said. Ultraprocessed foods also may impact the balance of flora in the gut, while additives may increase inflammation, free radicals and neuron death, the study said.

ìWith a sample size exceeding 42,800 participants and a long follow-up period up to 26 years, this study stands out not only for its power but also for its methodological rigor,î wrote the authors of a corresponding editorial published with the study.

The editorial was coauthored by Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, an associate professor of clinical neurology at Columbia University in New York City, and dietitian Maria Maraki, an assistant professor of sports medicine and exercise biology at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece. Neither were involved in the new research.


ìThe prevention of neurodegenerative diseases may begin at the dinner table,î they wrote. ìExcessive UPF consumption not only is a risk factor for metabolic diseases but may also accelerate neurodegenerative processes and associated symptoms.î

Early symptoms appear years before motor function declines
In the new study, published Wednesday in the journal Neurology, researchers looked at the prodromal stage of Parkinsonís disease ó early signals that appear years to decades before the tremors, stiff muscles, slow gait and changes in posture that are hallmark symptoms of Parkinsonís.

Body pain, constipation, signs of depression, changes in the ability to smell or see colors, and excessive daytime sleepiness can all be early signs of Parkinsonís disease, according to the Parkinsonís Foundation.


An extremely unusual sleep disorder, in which people can move during REM, or the rapid eye movement stage of sleep, is also a key early sign, according to research. The body is typically paralyzed during REM sleep so it cannot get up and act out any dreams.

The study found that people who ate about 11 servings a day of ultraprocessed food ó compared to people who only ate three ó had a 2.5-fold greater likelihood of exhibiting three or more of the early signs of Parkinsonís.

In addition, eating more ultraprocessed foods was tied to an increased risk for nearly all symptoms except constipation, according to the study. This finding held true even after researchers accounted for other factors, such as age, physical activity and smoking, that might impact the results.


ìParkinsonís is an incurable disease,î Gao said in an email. ìIn our previous study based on the same populations used for the current analysis, we found that a healthy dietary pattern and physical activity could slow the disease progression.

Eating more ultraprocessed food ups the risk of premature death, study finds

ìOur research shows that eating too much processed food, like sugary sodas and packaged snacks, might be speeding up early signs of Parkinsonís disease,î said senior study author Dr. Xiang Gao, a distinguished professor and dean of the Institute of Nutrition at Fudan University in Shanghai, China, in a statement.

This latest study is part of the ìgrowing evidence that diet might influence the development of Parkinsonís disease,î Gao said.


While the study found that people who ate more ultraprocessed foods tended to report more early symptoms, it did not find a direct increase in the risk of Parkinsonís disease itself, said Dr. Daniel van Wamelen, a clinical senior lecturer in neuroscience at Kingís College London. He was not involved in the new research.

ìThe study did not track whether participants were diagnosed with Parkinsonís later on,î van Wamelen said in a statement. ìThat said, having more of these symptoms suggests a higher risk over time.î

Brain health begins ëat the dinner tableí
The study analyzed years of health and diet data on nearly 43,000 participants of the Nursesí Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, two studies in the United States that have been gathering information on health behaviors for decades. The average age of people in the study was 48, and none had Parkinsonís disease at the beginning of the study. All self-reported what they ate every few years ó a limitation of the new research as participants may not have remembered their food intake accurately.

Ultraprocessed foods measured by the study included artificially or sugar-sweetened beverages; condiments, sauces and spreads; packaged sweets snacks or desserts; yogurt or dairy-based desserts; breads and cereals; and packaged savory snacks.


The study found a link between early signs of Parkinsonís disease and all types of ultraprocessed foods except breads and cereals ó a finding that indicates an underlying feature among most classes of ultraprocessed foods that may explain the results, the study said.

One reason could be ultraprocessed foods typically have less dietary fiber, protein and micronutrients ó but do have added sugar, salt, and saturated or trans fats, the study said. Ultraprocessed foods also may impact the balance of flora in the gut, while additives may increase inflammation, free radicals and neuron death, the study said.

ìWith a sample size exceeding 42,800 participants and a long follow-up period up to 26 years, this study stands out not only for its power but also for its methodological rigor,î wrote the authors of a corresponding editorial published with the study.

The editorial was coauthored by Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, an associate professor of clinical neurology at Columbia University in New York City, and dietitian Maria Maraki, an assistant professor of sports medicine and exercise biology at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece. Neither were involved in the new research.


ìThe prevention of neurodegenerative diseases may begin at the dinner table,î they wrote. ìExcessive UPF consumption not only is a risk factor for metabolic diseases but may also accelerate neurodegenerative processes and associated symptoms.î

Early symptoms appear years before motor function declines
In the new study, published Wednesday in the journal Neurology, researchers looked at the prodromal stage of Parkinsonís disease ó early signals that appear years to decades before the tremors, stiff muscles, slow gait and changes in posture that are hallmark symptoms of Parkinsonís.

Body pain, constipation, signs of depression, changes in the ability to smell or see colors, and excessive daytime sleepiness can all be early signs of Parkinsonís disease, according to the Parkinsonís Foundation.


An extremely unusual sleep disorder, in which people can move during REM, or the rapid eye movement stage of sleep, is also a key early sign, according to research. The body is typically paralyzed during REM sleep so it cannot get up and act out any dreams.

The study found that people who ate about 11 servings a day of ultraprocessed food ó compared to people who only ate three ó had a 2.5-fold greater likelihood of exhibiting three or more of the early signs of Parkinsonís.

Eating more ultraprocessed food ups the risk of premature death, study finds

ìOur research shows that eating too much processed food, like sugary sodas and packaged snacks, might be speeding up early signs of Parkinsonís disease,î said senior study author Dr. Xiang Gao, a distinguished professor and dean of the Institute of Nutrition at Fudan University in Shanghai, China, in a statement.

This latest study is part of the ìgrowing evidence that diet might influence the development of Parkinsonís disease,î Gao said.


While the study found that people who ate more ultraprocessed foods tended to report more early symptoms, it did not find a direct increase in the risk of Parkinsonís disease itself, said Dr. Daniel van Wamelen, a clinical senior lecturer in neuroscience at Kingís College London. He was not involved in the new research.

ìThe study did not track whether participants were diagnosed with Parkinsonís later on,î van Wamelen said in a statement. ìThat said, having more of these symptoms suggests a higher risk over time.î

Brain health begins ëat the dinner tableí
The study analyzed years of health and diet data on nearly 43,000 participants of the Nursesí Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, two studies in the United States that have been gathering information on health behaviors for decades. The average age of people in the study was 48, and none had Parkinsonís disease at the beginning of the study. All self-reported what they ate every few years ó a limitation of the new research as participants may not have remembered their food intake accurately.

Ultraprocessed foods measured by the study included artificially or sugar-sweetened beverages; condiments, sauces and spreads; packaged sweets snacks or desserts; yogurt or dairy-based desserts; breads and cereals; and packaged savory snacks.


The study found a link between early signs of Parkinsonís disease and all types of ultraprocessed foods except breads and cereals ó a finding that indicates an underlying feature among most classes of ultraprocessed foods that may explain the results, the study said.

One reason could be ultraprocessed foods typically have less dietary fiber, protein and micronutrients ó but do have added sugar, salt, and saturated or trans fats, the study said. Ultraprocessed foods also may impact the balance of flora in the gut, while additives may increase inflammation, free radicals and neuron death, the study said.

ìWith a sample size exceeding 42,800 participants and a long follow-up period up to 26 years, this study stands out not only for its power but also for its methodological rigor,î wrote the authors of a corresponding editorial published with the study.

The editorial was coauthored by Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, an associate professor of clinical neurology at Columbia University in New York City, and dietitian Maria Maraki, an assistant professor of sports medicine and exercise biology at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece. Neither were involved in the new research.


ìThe prevention of neurodegenerative diseases may begin at the dinner table,î they wrote. ìExcessive UPF consumption not only is a risk factor for metabolic diseases but may also accelerate neurodegenerative processes and associated symptoms.î

Early symptoms appear years before motor function declines
In the new study, published Wednesday in the journal Neurology, researchers looked at the prodromal stage of Parkinsonís disease ó early signals that appear years to decades before the tremors, stiff muscles, slow gait and changes in posture that are hallmark symptoms of Parkinsonís.

Body pain, constipation, signs of depression, changes in the ability to smell or see colors, and excessive daytime sleepiness can all be early signs of Parkinsonís disease, according to the Parkinsonís Foundation.


An extremely unusual sleep disorder, in which people can move during REM, or the rapid eye movement stage of sleep, is also a key early sign, according to research. The body is typically paralyzed during REM sleep so it cannot get up and act out any dreams.

The study found that people who ate about 11 servings a day of ultraprocessed food ó compared to people who only ate three ó had a 2.5-fold greater likelihood of exhibiting three or more of the early signs of Parkinsonís.

RSV hospitalization rate for seniors is 10 times higher than usual for this point in the season,"CNN
 ó 
The respiratory virus season has started early in kids this year and flooded childrenís hospitals in many parts of the country ñ especially with respiratory syncytial virus, known as RSV.

But adults can get RSV, too. Although RSV does not typically send as many adults to the hospital, it can be a serious and even deadly disease for seniors and people with underlying health conditions.

And with more kids getting RSV, the chances that adults will be exposed also rise. Some doctors say they are starting to see an uptick in adult patients.

This season, about 6 out of every 100,000 seniors has been hospitalized with RSV, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Thatís significantly lower than the rate for children but still uncharacteristically high. In the years before the Covid-19 pandemic, hospitalization rates for seniors were about 10 times lower at this point in the season.

Dr. Ann Falsey, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Rochester Medical Center who has published research on RSV in adults, said RSV rose somewhat in children in the summer and early fall last year, but the US did not see the usual proportional increase in RSV in older adults at the time.

ìI think that older adults were more cautious to continue public health measures like masks and social distance last year because they were still worrying about Covid,î Falsey said. ìBut this year, weíre starting to see older people ending up in the hospital again with RSV, because everyone is throwing caution to the wind.î

Virus flies under the radar in adults
Too often, RSV flies under the radar in adults, she said. Many people, even doctors, overlook its impact on adults.

ìThey think of it as strictly a pediatric disease, but you know, if you donít test for it, youíll never know what somebody actually is sick with,î Falsey said.

In the United States, tracking viruses like RSV isnít nearly as thorough as it is for Covid-19, so it is difficult to know exactly how many adults get sick with RSV. The numbers of RSV cases come from self reports that go to a few dozen labs that only represent about a tenth of the population, and reports are then shared with the CDC.

Flu and other respiratory virus activity continues to ramp up across the US

Based on best estimates, there are between 10,000 and 15,000 adult deaths in the United States from RSV each year and around 150,000 hospitalizations for RSV, Falsey said.

A 2015 study of older adults in industrialized countries said the disease burden of RSV is ìsubstantialî and calculated that about 14.5% of the 1.5 million adults who caught RSV were admitted to hospitals. People who were 65 and older were more likely to be hospitalized than those ages 50 to 64.

ìWhen we compare it to influenza A, itís not too far behind,î Falsey said, referring to one of the strains of seasonal flu thatís often linked with more severe illness.

RSV symptoms in adults
RSV shows up in adults the same way it does in kids. It can look like a common cold and include runny nose, decreased appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever and wheezing. The symptoms typically last a week or two, and they clear up with rest and fluids.

But in some adults, RSV can become dangerous because it can lead to dehydration, breathing trouble and more serious illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis, inflammation of the tiny airways in the lungs.

Adults at risk for severe illness from RSV
The adults who are most seriously at risk for severe outcomes with RSV are those 65 and older. The virus can spread quickly through a nursing home or long-term care facility, just like Covid-19 and flu.

Adults with weakened immune systems need to be careful in RSV season. This can include people undergoing treatment for cancer, transplant patients, people with HIV and those who take certain drugs that suppress the immune system for diseases like Crohnís, lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.

Adults with chronic heart or lung disease like asthma, COPD or heart failure are also more likely to have to go to the hospital if they catch RSV.

Lessons from past outbreaks can stop new epidemics in their tracks

An infected person can pass on RSV through a cough or sneeze. If the respiratory droplets land on a surface like a doorknob or desk and someone else touches it and then touches their face, they can get sick.

It also spreads because healthy adults often wonít know they have it. It doesnít typically cause fatigue like the flu or Covid does, so many adults will go to work or jump on a plane or bus, chalking up their symptoms to allergies. As they interact with others, it spreads further.

RSV can easily spread from children to adults, too.

What do you do if you get RSV
If you have been coughing or have any other RSV-like symptoms and you are in a high-risk category, you should go to your doctor and get it checked out, says Dr. Daphne-Dominique Villanueva.

ìWe canít test everybody right now ñ in an ideal world we would want to do that ñ but we want to concentrate on vulnerable people,î said Villanueva, an assistant professor in the School of Medicine at West Virginia University who has written studies about RSV.

Doctorsí offices have swab tests that can determine whether an illness is flu, RSV or Covid.

Treatment approved in Europe to prevent RSV in infants could be coming to the US soon

There are specific antivirals for flu and Covid-19 but not for RSV. The trick is getting tested early, even to rule out RSV; getting started on Covid or flu antivirals right away can shorten the time you are sick and keep the virus from progressing to something more serious.

With RSV, the treatment is whatís called supportive care: Drink plenty of fluids. Get some real rest. Stay home so you donít spread it. Wear a mask around others in your home.

If you start to wheeze and feel short of breath, Falsey said, those would be clear signals that you should see a doctor or maybe even take yourself to an emergency room quickly. At the hospital, they can give you supplemental oxygen if necessary.

Protection from RSV
Thereís no protection from a vaccine for RSV, but that could change by next season. In the US, there are four RSV vaccines that may be nearing review by the FDA, and more than a dozen are going through trials. Some are designed to protect infants, and some are being tested in older adults.

ìSince we have very limited ways of treating it effectively, you should do whatever you can to prevent getting it in the first place,î Villanueva said.

ìYou might want to put off that visit for a week to see your grandkids, or you might want to wear a mask if you are going into a crowded place,î Falsey said. ìMasks and hand-washing work. I know people are kind of over it, but if youíre a frail person or you know you have underlying medical conditions, when we know that RSV is surging, you should do those things and use caution around children who are actively sick.

"Covid-19 boosters could keep thousands of kids out of hospitals, but uptake remains low","CNN
 ó 
Higher Covid-19 vaccination rates among US children could prevent thousands of pediatric hospitalizations and millions of missed school days, according to an analysis published Tuesday by the Commonwealth Fund and the Yale School of Public Health.

If school-age children were vaccinated with the updated Covid-19 booster shot at the same rate that they were vaccinated against flu last season ñ between 50% and 60% coverage ñ at least 38,000 pediatric hospitalizations could be averted, including about 9,000 stays in intensive care units, through March. And if Covid-19 booster coverage reached 80% among school-age children by the end of the year, more than 50,000 hospitalizations could be averted.

Preventing Covid-19 hospitalizations could help ease the strain on pediatric hospitals, which have been especially full for the past few weeks as the respiratory virus season ñ including flu, RSV and Covid-19 ñ sweeps the country earlier than usual. Fewer than 1 in 4 pediatric hospital beds is available nationwide, including fewer than 10% of beds in seven states, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services.

ìThe overwhelmed health system means some families may not be able to get the care their child requires for a medical emergency,î Dr. Moira Szilagyi, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, wrote in a CNN Opinion article, calling the situation a ìcrisis.î

Covid-19 transmission is significantly lower now than earlier in the year; less than 5% of the US population lives in a county considered to have a high Covid-19 community level, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But more than 2,400 children were admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 last week ñ nearly three times higher than the week before, CDC data shows.

The new analysis also found that higher vaccination rates could help keep kids in school, a benefit that other research has found could have important effects on mental health and academic achievement.


Assuming a five-day isolation period for children with mild illness and 10 days for those who are hospitalized or otherwise severely ill, bringing Covid-19 booster uptake in line with flu shots for children could prevent more than 22 million days of school absenteeism.

Moderna says updated booster generated 'significantly higher' neutralizing antibodies against BA.4/BA.5 subvariants

But the scenarios presented in the new analysis are quite unrealistic. So far, less than 5% of school-age children have their updated booster shot, according to CDC data.

A record number of updated Covid-19 boosters were administered in the first week of November, and US officials say theyíre planning to push this week for people to get boosted against Covid-19 in order to offer maximum protection around Thanksgiving, but overall uptake remains low. To get to 50% coverage by the end of the year, the pace of vaccination would have to be at least 10 times faster than itís been in November.

And Covid-19 vaccination rates among children have long lagged behind those for adults. Just 32% of children ages 5 to 11 and 61% of those ages 12 to 17 have competed their initial series of Covid-19 vaccination, compared with 78% of adults.

ìAccelerated vaccination campaigns that achieve high coverage across all ages have the potential to prevent a possible imminent surge in Covid-19, protecting children both directly and indirectly and providing them with additional stability in terms of school attendance and other social engagement,î the study authors wrote. ìThe cost of inaction could be steep: millions more days of school absenteeism and thousands of preventable hospitalizations for children.î

Experimental therapy gantenerumab fails to slow or improve Alzheimer's memory loss in clinical trials,"CNN
 ó 
An experimental treatment, gantenerumab, failed to help people at high risk of memory loss from Alzheimerís or those who were in the early phases of the disease, the manufacturer said Monday.

Gantenerumab is part of a class of injected drugs that are designed to remove sticky protein pieces called beta amyloid from the brain. Beta amyloid buildup is a hallmark of Alzheimerís disease.

Most of these drugs have worked as intended to clear the beta amyloid, but many have still failed to demonstrate any real-life benefits to patients; their brain function and memory doesnít improve significantly, despite treatment.

Roche said Monday that gantenerumab appears to have removed less beta amyloid from the brains of study participants than anticipated. The company said the results from Phase 3 of its trials, called Graduate, were hard but important to share.

ìSo many of our families have been directly affected by Alzheimerís, so this news is very disappointing to deliver,î Dr. Levi Garraway, Rocheís chief medical officer and head of global product development, said in a news release. ìWhile the GRADUATE results are not what we hoped, we are proud to have delivered a high quality, clear and comprehensive Alzheimerís dataset to the field, and we look forward to sharing our learnings with the community as we continue to search for new treatments for this complex disease.î

Roche said it would share more findings from its study at an upcoming medical conference.


The results for gantenerumab follow positive results for a different beta amyloid reducing drug, lecanemab. The companies testing that medication, Biogen and Eisai, announced this year that lecanemab had slowed the decline of brain function in Alzheimerís disease by about 27% compared with a placebo. Some experts feel that degree of benefit is on par with that of the controversial Alzheimerís drug Aduhelm, which was approved by the US Food and Drug Adminstration despite a lack of support from the agencyís independent advisers.

Dr. Constantine Lyketsos, a professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, said that if gantenerumab had removed as much beta amyloid as the company predicted it would, it might have shown a degree of benefit in line with lecanemab and Aduhelm.

ìIn other words, a very modest but not clinically significant effect,î said Lyketsos, who was not involved in the research.

"US gets D+ grade for rising preterm birth rates, new report finds","CNN
 ó 
The rate of premature birth in the United States is climbing, according to the infant and maternal health nonprofit March of Dimes.

On Tuesday, the organization released its annual ìreport cardî on maternal and infant health, which involves a newly updated calculation system. Taking an in-depth look at premature births, the new report found that the US preterm birth rate rose to 10.5% last year, representing an increase of 4% since 2020 and the worst national rate since March of Dimes started tracking this data in 2007, based on its new calculation system.

ìThis is actually a 15-year high in the preterm birth rate in this country,î said Dr. Zsakeba Henderson, senior vice president and interim chief medical and health officer at March of Dimes.

The US preterm birth rate peaked in 2006 at 12.8%, according to data from the National Center for Health Statistics.

Since then, some March of Dimes reports have found US preterm birth rates much higher than 10.5%, but those rates were based on calculations that have since been updated, according to March of Dimes.

ìThere are too many babies being born too soon: 1 in 10. If you were to have 10 babies in front of you and one of them is having to face the complications that comes with prematurity, thatís unacceptable, and we need to do better,î Henderson said, adding that those 1 in 10 are more likely to be Black, American Indian or Alaska Native.


March of Dimes data in the new report shows that infants born to Black and Native American mothers are 62% more likely to be born preterm than those born to White women.

States with the highest and lowest rates
The new March of Dimes report also highlighted state-by-state differences in the rate of babies born prematurely across the country.

The report grades a preterm birth rate less than or equal to 7.7% as an A and a preterm birth rate greater than or equal to 11.5% as an F.

The national preterm birth rate of 10.5% is graded as a D+.

No state has achieved an A rate, and only one has a state-level preterm birth rate that would be graded as an A-: Vermont, which has the lowest preterm birth rate in the US at 8%.

Meanwhile, nine states and one territory have preterm birth rates that received an F grade: Georgia and Oklahoma with 11.9%; Arkansas, Kentucky and Puerto Rico with 12%; South Carolina with 12.1%; West Virginia with 12.8%; Alabama with 13.1%; Louisiana with 13.5%; and Mississippi with the highest preterm birth rate of all states at 15%.

March of Dimes
ìThe areas that have the worst grades are the same areas weíve been seeing consistently for a long time, and itís past time for us to do what we need to do to make health better and make our country a better place to give birth and be born,î Henderson said. ìItís unfortunate that we donít have policies in place to protect the most vulnerable in our country, and without protecting our moms and babies, we canít secure the health of everyone else.î

To address these state-by-state disparities in preterm births and help improve the national preterm birth rate as a whole, March of Dimes has been advocating for certain policies, Henderson said, including the Black Maternal Health ìMomnibusî Act of 2021, a sweeping bipartisan package of bills to provide pre- and postnatal support for Black mothers ñ but most of the bills in the package are still making their way through Congress.

March of Dimes also has been urging more states to adopt legislation expanding access to doulas and midwives, among other maternal health care services, and reduce the prevalence of maternity care deserts across the country.

How Covid-19 plays a role
There are many potential factors contributing to the nationís rising preterm birth rate, and Henderson said the Covid-19 pandemic remains one of the biggest.

ìWe cannot forget about the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and recognize that there is likely a huge contribution of that, knowing that Covid-19 infection increases the risk of preterm birth,î she said. ìBut we also know that this pandemic brought many other issues to the forefront, knowing that issues around structural racism and barriers to adequate prenatal care, issues around access, were brought to the forefront during this pandemic as well.î

She added that many mothers in the United States are starting pregnancies later in life, and there has been an increase in mothers with chronic health conditions, who are at higher risk of having to give birth early due to pregnancy complications.

Henderson also said that preterm birth is one of the top causes of infant deaths and disproportionately affects babies born to women of color.

ìThe United States is one of the worst places to give birth and be born among industrialized countries, unfortunately. When we look at maternal deaths and infant deaths, weíre at the bottom of the pack among countries with similar profiles in terms of gross domestic product,î Henderson said. ìItís because of our disproportionate numbers of preterm births ñ particularly for populations that are disproportionately impacted, such as Black families and American Indian and Alaskan Native families ñ that our rates are so much higher than other countries.î

An ëurgent public health issueí
Globally, about 10% of births are preterm worldwide ñ similar to the US preterm birth rate.

About 15 million babies are born preterm each year, amounting to more than 1 in 10 of all births around the world, according to the World Health Organization, which has called prematurity an ìurgent public health issueî and ìthe leading cause of death of children under 5.î

Separate from the March of Dimes report, WHO released new guidelines Tuesday on how nations can improve survival and health outcomes for babies born too early, at 37 weeks of pregnancy or less, or too small, at 5Ω pounds or less.

These WHO recommendations advise that skin-to-skin contact, also known as kangaroo mother care, be provided to a preterm infant immediately after birth, without any initial time spent in an incubator.

ìPreviously, we recommended that kangaroo mother care to only be for babies that were completely stable,î said pediatrician Dr. Karen Edmond, medical officer for newborn health at WHO, who was the lead on the new guidelines.

ìBut now we know that if we put babies in skin-to-skin contact, unless they are really critically ill, that this will vastly increase their chances of surviving,î she said. ìSo whatís new is that we now know that we should provide kangaroo mother care immediately after birth, rather than waiting until the babyís stable.î

Edmond added that immediate kangaroo mother care can help infants better regulate their body temperature and help protect against infections, and she said that these guidelines are for on-the-ground health care providers as well as families.

The new WHO guidelines also recommend that emotional, financial and workplace support be provided for families of babies born too early or at low birth weights.

ìPreterm babies can survive, thrive, and change the world ñ but each baby must be given that chance,î WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a news release.

"Desperate for heart surgery for their baby, a family feels the effects of pediatric hospital shortages","CNN
 ó 
Even before their daughter was born in June, Aaron and Helen Chavez knew she would need heart surgery. Doctors expected her to have an operation around 6 months of age.

When it became apparent in September that it would have to happen much sooner than expected, the Chavezes said, they endured an agonizing monthlong wait for a bed to open at their local childrenís hospital so baby MJ could have the procedure she needed.

ìThey said, ëWell, we would love to get her in as soon as possible. However, right now, we donít have beds,í î Aaron said.

Space for children in hospitals is at a premium across the country. Data reported to the US government shows that as of Friday, more than three-quarters of pediatric hospital beds and 80% of intensive care beds for kids are full. Thatís up from an average of about two-thirds full over the past two years.

Federal data shows that the strain on hospital beds for kids began in August and September, which is right around the start of the school year in many areas.

Orange, CA - November 01: Various signs are posted outside the emergency room entrance at Providence St. Joseph Hospital in Orange, on Tuesday, November 1, 2022.  Orange Countys health officer has declared a local health emergency in response to increases in respiratory illnesses and an onslaught of the quickly spreading RSV, a respiratory virus that is most dangerous in young children.

Flu and other respiratory virus activity continues to ramp up across the US

Hospitals are seeing higher than normal numbers of sick infants and children due to a particularly early and severe season for respiratory infections in kids, including respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, and influenza.

As of Friday, Golisano Childrenís Hospital in Rochester, New York, the facility that treated the Chavezesí daughter, was over capacity. Federal data shows that it has been consistently more full than the national average over the past few months. Golisano went from having 85% of its beds occupied in August to over 100% now.

Like many other hospitals across the country, Golisano has seen a sharp increase in children who are severely ill with RSV. Dr. Tim Stevens, the chief clinical officer, said 35% of the hospitalís current patients ñ excluding those in the neonatal intensive care unit ñ have RSV.

A lack of available beds means patients are sometimes held in the emergency department to wait for a bed to open so they can be admitted, Stevens says.

It may also mean children who have chronic conditions and need procedures or hospital care, but whose conditions are stable, may have to wait.

A hole in the heart
MJ was born in June with a ventricular septal birth defect ñ a hole between the pumping chambers of her heart. Itís a relatively common problem affecting about 1 in every 240 infants in the United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Doctors could see the defect on prenatal ultrasounds, but because MJ was never in the right position to get a good image, they werenít sure of its size.

If theyíre small enough, these holes usually close on their own soon after birth. But the hole in MJís heart was not small.

It caused the oxygen-rich blood coming from her lungs to mix with oxygen-poor blood returning from the rest of her body. Too much blood got squeezed back into her tiny lungs with each heartbeat, straining her respiratory system.

Everything exhausted her, even nursing or drinking from a bottle. ìShe would stop eating before she was full and before she got the calories that she needed,î Aaron said.

Typically, babies will take a bottle for 15 to 20 minutes at a time, but MJ would doze off after six or seven minutes, her mother recalls.

With hospital beds in short supply, Mattie McKoy waited three weeks for scans in Atlanta.

They didnít worry, Helen says, because they were trying hard not to be anxious newbies. ìAll those websites, they say sometimes you just have a sleepy baby, and itís OK,î she said.

Other signs that MJ might be hungry could be explained away, too. They mistook her constant fussing for colic. Her scalp started to get dry and flaky, and they thought it might be a common skin condition called cradle cap.

As first-time parents, the Chavezes didnít realize at first that MJ wasnít eating enough. Doctors didnít immediately catch it, either. MJ got three checkups during her first month, one within a few days of coming home from the hospital, the other at two weeks and another at one month.

Itís normal for babies to lose weight after birth, especially if Mom got IV fluids during labor and delivery. They typically return to their birth weights by 2 to 3 weeks of age. And at first, MJ did regain weight, climbing back to her birth weight by 2 weeks old.

But babies with heart conditions like hers can have faster-than-normal metabolisms, and it was between weeks two and four that her parents say the feeding issues really began to cause problems.

ìWe were frustrated and we were scared, because she looked like she was losing weight, not gaining weight. She was very thin for a baby,î Aaron said.

The doctors had advised them to count the number of wet and dirty diapers she was having each day as a way to judge whether she was eating enough. Her parents didnít know it was not as much as she should have been.

ìOne day, I was holding her, sitting in our recliner. I looked down at her and I was like, ëthis baby looks puny. Like, she does not look like she feels good,í î Helen said.

She called their pediatrician, who saw them the same day. The pediatrician immediately notified their cardiologist, who arranged for a feeding tube to help MJ get more nutrition.

ëNot going to hit that six-month markí
Helen says they had been told MJ would need surgery to repair the hole in her heart around 6 months of age.

ìOnce the feeding issues started, though, that I think that we all kind of realized that, OK, sheís probably not going to hit that six-month mark,î she says.

MJ got the feeding tube when she was around 6 weeks old, in August. Her doctors started talking about moving the operation up but advised her parents that she would need to gain some weight first.

The feeding tube helped for a time, but by the time MJ was 3 months old, her condition had deteriorated.

ìEvery breath came with a grunt,î Aaron said. ìShe was fairly regularly sweating, no matter the ambient temperature in the room or whether we were holding her or not.î

Every time MJ drew a breath, the skin around her collarbone would suck in and her abdomen would pull under ribcage, a symptom known as a retraction. Retractions are a sign that someone is working very hard to breathe.

ìIt looked like her chest was almost scooping under her lungs with each breath. The retractions were getting really bad. It was around that point that they told us, ëHey, yeah, this is accelerating faster. Weíre going to need to get her in for surgery soon,í î Aaron said.

Helen said their cardiologist first discussed getting MJís case reviewed ñ a key step her doctors needed to prepare for her surgery ñ on September 14.

ìHe said, ëit might take a couple of weeks to get her in because weíve been really slammed with emergencies, but weíll get her in,í î Helen said.

An agonizing wait
Doctors put MJ on medications called diuretics to help drain excess fluid off her lungs and ease her breathing ñ but then, at the end of September, she caught a cold.

It wasnít a bad cold, and Helen Chavez, a pharmacist, thinks that if the baby had been healthy, she probably could have fought it off at home with no problems. But Helen was worried, so she took she MJ to the ER.

The doctors checked her, determined she was stable and sent the family home with supportive care.

At a follow-up doctorís visit, Helen said, she asked again, ìWhere are we on the surgery?î

Helen said the cardiologist said they had not been able to review MJís case.

ìAnd they said, ëWell, we would love to get her in as soon as possible. However, right now we donít have beds,í î Aaron said.

ìThroughout that time, she kept getting worse. More symptoms would pop up in terms of the breathing would get worse, the retractions would get worse, that kind of a thing. Like there was more and more and more piling up,î Aaron said.

Helen said she understood that MJís condition was still stable, but she was worried it wouldnít stay that way.

ìI was like, ëIím worried sheís going to crash and thatís how weíre going to get in for this surgery is, itís going to take this kid crashing and burning before we can get her in,í î Helen told the doctor, who reassured her.

î ëNo, no, no, she is not going to get to that point before we get her in,í î she says they were told.

On October 10, things took a turn.

The baby slept in a bassinet beside her parentsí bed. Helen nudged Aaron awake around midnight to look at their daughter, and his first thought was to reassure his wife that yes, the doctors had told them that her breathing was going to look bad. But then he rolled over and peered at MJ, who was asleep.

ìThat was the moment that I was wide awake,î Aaron said, and he was terrified.

ìIt was the raggedness of her breathing and the noise. Every breath, there was a strange sound coming from her. It sounded like she was fighting for, like, struggling for every breath.î

They raced to the hospital.

ìWe were sitting in the ER, and every other kid in that pediatric ER was hacking, coughing, sneezing,î Helen said. ìClearly, respiratory viruses hit Rochester early and very hard.î

Helen said it was clear by the end of that visit that medications had done all they could do and that MJ would continue to get worse without the operation.

ìOur understanding is, it took an extra ER visit to push the timeline,î Helen said.

That visit prompted an emergency appointment with the cardiologist.

ìThatís where they were like, ëOK, weíve got her in for conference,í î Helen said.

Counting the days to surgery
The hospital says it canít comment on the specifics of MJís case.

ìThe Golisano Childrenís Hospital cardiology and cardiac surgery teams review the status of all pediatric patients who need heart surgery twice a week,î the hospital said in a statement to CNN. ìWe cannot comment on a specific case, but once surgery becomes necessary, it is scheduled as quickly as needed based on the medical condition of the child. The current high census of pediatric inpatients at our hospital has not affected our ability to schedule non-elective pediatric cardiac surgeries in a timely way.î

Stevens, the chief clinical officer, says those decisions are made on a case-by-case basis.

ìEach of those are reviewed by our medical and surgical team to determine whether or not theyíre time-sensitive,î he said. ìThings that are time-sensitive or certainly urgent or emergent, they get done.î

When it becomes clear that a child needs to be admitted, Stevens said, hospital officials find ways to open beds, and they try to do it so it doesnít exhaust their nurses.

Stevens says heís hopeful the situation will improve, that infections will die down, ìbecause this is not sustainable.î

Aaron Chavez agrees that there was no delay once MJís case got the necessary review ñ but says that review itself kept getting put off.

ìWe were essentially told that her case review was being delayed because they simply didnít have the beds,î he said.

The surgical team reviewed MJís case on October 13, and she had surgery 12 days later, according to Aaron.

Aaron says the family has no complaints about the quality of care their daughter received, and theyíre grateful to the entire team of doctors, nurses and other staff who treated their daughter.

ìOnce push came to shove, they definitely got her in, but the last four weeks were really, really harrowing,î Helen said. ìIt was just kind of hard to watch your baby have trouble breathing and know that thereís not a whole lot you can do.î

Like a different baby
On the morning of October 25, the Chavezes brought MJ to the hospital, where doctors walked them through the operation. A piece of synthetic material would be sewn into her heart to patch the hole. Over time, the material would allow her own cells to grow on it and cover the defect.

The procedure could take as long as 12 hours. But it went faster than anticipated, and MJ was finished in half that time. The surgeon came out to tell them the good news: The operation had been a success.

ìHer surgeon said that it was the biggest hole that he has seen in 2022 and one of the biggest he has ever seen,î Aaron said.

The Chavezes then went to the pediatric intensive care unit to wait for MJ. As soon as they saw her, they could see she was better.

Before the surgery, her skin had been pale and mottled; after, she was a healthy pink.

ìJust in that short amount of time, her skin had that pinkness and redness in places that you expect like the nose, and her fingers were proper pink,î he said. ìThat color you expect out of a healthy baby. It was really nice to see that.î

She was in the hospital for six days, and her recovery amazed her care team.

ìShe kind of crushed recovery milestones like it was her job,î Aaron said.

Now back home, MJ is playing catch-up with the developmental milestones she missed while she was sick. Her muscles are weak, she canít sit up or roll over yet, and she may never switch back from the feeding tube to a bottle. A team of occupational and physical therapists comes over to help. They expect she will eventually make up for the time she missed, but it will take some work.

Still, Aaron says the surgery has had an amazing effect.

Before her operation, MJ was very uncomfortable and always tired.

ìThe baby that I have now, that returned from surgery, is constantly smiling at us. Sheís almost laughed three different times in the last couple of days, right? Sheís so close to a laugh. She seems like an entirely different baby,î Aaron said.

A powerful reminder
The Chavezes were nervous about sharing their story, but in the end, they decided it was important to shed light on the effects of the ongoing hospital bed shortage.

ìEverybody we have told about the bed shortage, that we have told about the nurses and the staff and the doctors telling us how burnt-out and frustrated they are and how tired they are, everybodyís surprised,î Aaron said.

ìEverybodyís shocked. Everybody thinks that this is over. The pandemic is over. Our health care systemís back to normal. ëWhat are you talking about? What shortages?í ì

In the end, they felt powerless. What could they ñ two exhausted working parents with a sick infant ñ do to solve a national crisis?

After all, after nearly three years of a viral pandemic, doesnít everyone already know what to do? Stay home if youíre sick. Put on a mask in public places while viral illnesses are running rampant. Get vaccinated.

ìI donít know how Iím supposed to help tell 330 million people, ëHey, you should care about each other,í î Aaron says.

Their story is one reminder of why all those simple but effective measures are important.

ìIn the end, we believe the information getting out there is better than not,î Aaron said. ìHopefully, it will help push those in power to do better.î",13-Nov-22,health,Brenda Goodman and Deidre

Fuzzy first photo of a black hole gets a sharp makeover,"CNN
 ó 
The first photo ever taken of a black hole looks a little sharper now.

Originally released in 2019, the unprecedented historic image of the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy Messier 87 captured an essentially invisible celestial object using direct imaging.

The image presented the first direct visual evidence that black holes exist, showcasing a central dark region encapsulated by a ring of light that looks brighter on one side. Astronomers nicknamed the object the ìfuzzy, orange donut.î

Now, scientists have used machine learning to give the image a cleaner upgrade that looks more like a ìskinnyî doughnut, researchers said. The central region is darker and larger, surrounded by a bright ring as hot gas falls into the black hole in the new image.

A machine-learning technique was used to enhance the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration's image (left) of the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy Messier 87 and produce a sharper image.

In 2017, astronomers set out to observe the invisible heart of the massive galaxy Messier 87, or M87, near the Virgo galaxy cluster 55 million light-years from Earth.

The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration, called EHT, is a global network of telescopes that captured the first photograph of a black hole. More than 200 researchers worked on the project for more than a decade. The project was named for the event horizon, the proposed boundary around a black hole that represents the point of no return where no light or radiation can escape.

To capture an image of the black hole, scientists combined the power of seven radio telescopes around the world using Very-Long-Baseline-Interferometry, according to the European Southern Observatory, which is part of the EHT. This array effectively created a virtual telescope around the same size as Earth.

ëMaximum resolutioní achieved
Data from the original 2017 observation was combined with a machine learning technique to capture the full resolution of what the telescopes saw for the first time. The new, more detailed image, along with a study, was released on Thursday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.

Dwarf starburst galaxy Henize 2-10 sparkles with young stars in this Hubble visible-light image. The bright region at the center, surrounded by pink clouds and dark dust lanes, indicates the location of the galaxy's massive black hole and active stellar nurseries.

ìWith our new machine learning technique, PRIMO, we were able to achieve the maximum resolution of the current array,î said lead study author Lia Medeiros, astrophysics postdoctoral fellow in the School of Natural Sciences at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, in a statement.

ìSince we cannot study black holes up-close, the detail of an image plays a critical role in our ability to understand its behavior. The width of the ring in the image is now smaller by about a factor of two, which will be a powerful constraint for our theoretical models and tests of gravity.î

Medeiros and other EHT members developed Principal-component Interferometric Modeling, or PRIMO. The algorithm relies on dictionary learning in which computers create rules based on large amounts of material. If a computer is given a series of images of different bananas, combined with some training, it might be able to tell if an unknown image does or doesnít contain a banana.

Computers using PRIMO analyzed more than 30,000 high-resolution simulated images of black holes to pick out common structural details. This allowed the machine learning essentially to fill in the gaps of the original image.

ìPRIMO is a new approach to the difficult task of constructing images from EHT observations,î said Tod Lauer, an astronomer at the National Science Foundationís National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory, or NOIRLab. ìIt provides a way to compensate for the missing information about the object being observed, which is required to generate the image that would have been seen using a single gigantic radio telescope the size of the Earth.î

Advancing research of black holes
Black holes are made up of huge amounts of matter squeezed into a small area, according to NASA, creating a massive gravitational field that draws in everything around it, including light. These powerful celestial phenomena also have a way of superheating the material around them and warping space-time.

Material accumulates around black holes, is heated to billions of degrees and reaches nearly the speed of light. Light bends around the gravity of the black hole, which creates the photon ring seen in the image. The black holeís shadow is represented by the dark central region.

The visual confirmation of black holes also acts as confirmation of Albert Einsteinís theory of general relativity. In the theory, Einstein predicted that dense, compact regions of space would have such intense gravity that nothing could escape them. But if heated materials in the form of plasma surround the black hole and emit light, the event horizon could be visible.

The new image can help scientists make more accurate measurements of the black holeís mass. Researchers can also apply PRIMO to other EHT observations, including those of the black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy.

ìThe 2019 image was just the beginning,î Medeiros said. ìIf a picture is worth a thousand words, the data underlying that image have many more stories to tell. PRIMO will continue to be a critical tool in extracting such insights.î",14-Apr-23,health,Ashley Strickland,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/world/sharp-black-hole-image-scn/index.html,,,,,,,,,,,,cnn ‚Äî first photo ever taken black hole looks little sharper now originally released unprecedented historic image supermassive black hole center galaxy messier captured essentially invisible celestial object using direct imaging image presented first direct visual evidence black holes exist showcasing central dark region encapsulated ring light looks brighter one side astronomers nicknamed object ‚Äúfuzzy orange donut‚Äù now scientists used machine learning give image cleaner upgrade looks like ‚Äúskinny‚Äù doughnut researchers said central region darker larger surrounded bright ring hot gas falls black hole new image machinelearning technique used enhance event horizon telescope collaborations image left supermassive black hole center galaxy messier produce sharper image machinelearning technique used enhance event horizon telescope collaborations image left supermassive black hole center galaxy messier produce sharper image noirlab astronomers set observe invisible heart massive galaxy messier m near virgo galaxy cluster million lightyears earth event horizon telescope collaboration called eht global network telescopes captured first photograph black hole researchers worked project decade project named event horizon proposed boundary around black hole represents point return light radiation can escape capture image black hole scientists combined power seven radio telescopes around world using verylongbaselineinterferometry according european southern observatory part eht array effectively created virtual telescope around size earth ‚Äòmaximum resolution‚Äô achieved data original observation combined machine learning technique capture full resolution telescopes saw first time new detailed image along study released thursday astrophysical journal letters dwarf starburst galaxy henize sparkles young stars hubble visiblelight image bright region center surrounded pink clouds dark dust lanes indicates location galaxys massive black hole active stellar nurseries related article black hole fueling star birth scientists doubletake ‚Äúwith new machine learning technique primo able achieve maximum resolution current array‚Äù said lead study author lia medeiros astrophysics postdoctoral fellow school natural sciences institute advanced study princeton new jersey statement ‚Äúsince study black holes upclose detail image plays critical role ability understand behavior width ring image now smaller factor two powerful constraint theoretical models tests gravity‚Äù medeiros eht members developed principalcomponent interferometric modeling primo algorithm relies dictionary learning computers create rules based large amounts material computer given series images different bananas combined training might able tell unknown image doesn‚Äôt contain banana ultramassive black hole related article astronomers discover ultramassive black hole using new technique computers using primo analyzed highresolution simulated images black holes pick common structural details allowed machine learning essentially fill gaps original image ‚Äúprimo new approach difficult task constructing images eht observations‚Äù said tod lauer astronomer national science foundation‚Äôs national opticalinfrared astronomy research laboratory noirlab ‚Äúit provides way compensate missing information object observed required generate image seen using single gigantic radio telescope size earth‚Äù advancing research black holes black holes made huge amounts matter squeezed small area according nasa creating massive gravitational field draws everything around including light powerful celestial phenomena also way superheating material around warping spacetime material accumulates around black holes heated billions degrees reaches nearly speed light light bends around gravity black hole creates photon ring seen image black hole‚Äôs shadow represented dark central region visual confirmation black holes also acts confirmation albert einstein‚Äôs theory general relativity theory einstein predicted dense compact regions space intense gravity nothing escape heated materials form plasma surround black hole emit light event horizon visible new image can help scientists make accurate measurements black hole‚Äôs mass researchers can also apply primo eht observations including black hole center milky way galaxy ‚Äúthe image just beginning‚Äù medeiros said ‚Äúif picture worth thousand words data underlying image many stories tell primo continue critical tool extracting insights‚Äù
Paper airplane breaks a world distance record,"CNN
 ó 
Itís a birdÖ Itís a planeÖ Itís a paper airplane!

The world record for the farthest flight by paper airplane has been broken by three aerospace engineers with a paper aircraft that flew a grand total of 289 feet, 9 inches (88 meters), nearly the length of an American football field.

They beat the previous record of 252 feet, 7 inches (77 meters) achieved on April 2022 by a trio in South Korea. Prior to that, the record had not been broken in over a decade.

ìIt really put things on the map and itís a really proud moment for family and friends,î said Dillon Ruble, a systems engineer at Boeing and now paper airplane record holder, in a release. ìItís a good tie in to aerospace and thinking along the lines of designing and creating prototypes.î

Ruble worked alongside Garrett Jensen, a strength engineer also with Boeing, and aerospace engineer Nathaniel Erickson. The trio are recent graduates who studied aerospace engineering and mechanical engineering at Missouri University of Science and Technology.

The feat required months of effort, as the team put in nearly 500 hours of studying origami and aerodynamics to create and test multiple prototypes. The engineers put their final design to the test on December 2, 2022, in Crown Point, Indiana, where the record was achieved on Rubleís third throw.


ìWe hope this record stands for quite a while ó 290 feet (88 meters) is unreal,î Jensen said in the release. ìThatís 14 to 15 feet (4.2 to 4.6 meters) over the farthest throw we ever did. It took a lot of planning and a lot of skill to beat the previous record.î

Paper plane physics
The team had decided their best chance at beating the world record would be with an airplane design that focused on speed and minimized drag, so that the plane could fly a far distance in a short amount of time.

Gathering inspiration from various hypersonic aircrafts, vehicles that can fly faster than five times the speed of sound (Mach 5), specifically the NASA X-43A, the team had come up with the winning paper aircraft design ó later named ìMach 5.î

ìFull-scale and paper airplanes have vast differences in their complexity, but both operate on the same fundamental principles,î said Ruble, via email. ìSome of the same design methodologies can be applied to both. One of these methods was our trial-and-error design process. For instance, we would theorize about a fold we could change on our plane, fold it, throw it, and compare the distance to previous iterations to determine if the change was beneficial.î

To find the best technique when it came to throwing the paper airplane, the team ran various simulations and analyzed slow-motion videos of their previous throws.

ìWe found the optimal angle is about 40 degrees off the ground. Once youíre aiming that high, you throw as hard as possible. That gives us our best distance,î Jensen said in the statement. ìIt took simulations to figure that out. I didnít think we could get useful data from a simulation on a paper airplane. Turns out, we could.î

Even down to the paper, which the team had decided that A4 (slightly longer than typical letter sized paper) was the best for manipulating and folding into the winning airplane. With these meticulously thought-out design choices, and careful attention to the numerous rules and guidelines set forth by the Guinness World Record Team, the three were set to break a record.

On its record-breaking distance flight the plane was in the air for roughly six seconds. The Guinness paper plane record for duration of flight is currently 29.2 seconds.

ìThe design objectives for an air-time record would be vastly different from the low-drag version we built for the longest-distance record,î Ruble said via email. ìIncreasing the wingspan and decreasing the aspect ratio would be the first steps in producing this type of plane.î

Paper airplane aside, Ruble added that this tedious method of back-and-forth trials served as a testament to the importance of rigorous prototyping in the real world.

From origami enthusiasts to aerospace engineers
Ruble and Jensen began their paper plane engineering careers while in middle school, participating in paper airplane events held at Boeing. Ruble said he enjoyed making the paper come to life and the hard work he had to put in to find ways to improve his designs. Both were also fans of origami as kids.

The record-breaking team hopes their accomplishment will inspire other young and aspiring aerospace engineers to chase their dreams.

For those looking to create their own record-breaking paper plane design, the feat is not impossible, but may take some time (and skill).

ìMach 5 flies best at high relative velocity, but to achieve this condition, the aircraft must be launched in a specific manner,î said Ruble via email. ìThis technique, in addition to the complexity of the plane, means that only the most experienced paper aircraft enthusiasts would have success with the design.

ìHowever, by starting with publicly available designs, anyone can hone their skills to throw paper airplanes farther and higher than all of their friends,î he added.",14-Apr-23,health,Taylor

This bat fossil could fill in a piece of the evolutionary puzzle,"Two 52 million-year-old bat skeletons discovered in an ancient lake bed in Wyoming are the oldest bat fossils ever found ó and they reveal a new species.

Tim Rietbergen, an evolutionary biologist at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, the Netherlands, identified the previously unknown bat species when he began collecting measurements and other data from museum specimens.

ìThis new research is a step forward in understanding what happened in terms of evolution and diversity back in the early days of bat,î he said.

Today, there are more than 1,400 living bat species found all over the world, with the exception of polar regions. But how the creatures evolved to be the only mammal capable of powered flight isnít well understood.

The bat fossil record is patchy, and the two fossils Rietbergen identified as a new species were lucky finds ó exceptionally well-preserved and revealing the animalsí complete skeletons, including teeth.

ìBat skeletons are small, light and fragile, which is very unfavorable for the fossilization process. They simply do not preserve well,î he said.


The newly discovered extinct bat species -ó Icaronycteris gunnelli ó was not much different from bats that fly around today. Its teeth revealed that it lived on a diet of insects. It was tiny, weighing in at only 25 grams (0.88 ounces).

ìIf it folds his wings next to its body, it would easily fit inside your hand. Its wings were relatively short and broad, reflecting a more fluttering flight style,î Rietbergen said.

This particular bat lived when Earthís climate was warm and humid. The two skeletons Rietbergen studied survived the eons likely because the creatures fell into a lake, putting them out of reach of predators and into an environment more conducive to fossilization. The ancient lake bed is part of Wyomingís Green River Formation and has yielded a number of bat fossils.

One of the two fossils was collected by a private collector in 2017 and purchased by the American Museum of Natural History. The other belonged to the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto and was found in 1994.

How long you can use vintage Tupperware,"CNN
 ó 
Tupperware, the iconic kitchen brand thatís been a household name for decades, recently received a lifeline from its creditors, but the business still faces extreme challenges. Given the brandís prospects, you might be wondering how long your stash of its food storage containers is safe to use ó especially if itís vintage.

Figuring out the answer to that question for any type of reusable plastic food storage products ó not just Tupperware ó often comes down to understanding what theyíre made of. Bisphenol A, more commonly known as BPA, is a chemical that, according to the United States Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, has been used for years in the production of certain plastics to make them more durable and shatter-resistant. Unfortunately, BPA can also make them potential health hazards.

In human studies, BPA exposure has been associated with a higher risk of a wide range of health conditions or issues, such as infertility, altered fetal growth of the fetus, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and aggression among children, polycystic ovarian syndrome, endometriosis, and heart disease, said Laura Vandenberg, a professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

01:34
In addition to food containers, BPA has been used in various other products, such as shatterproof windows, water bottles and eyewear, and in resins coating metal food cans, bottle tops and water supply pipes. The composition of your plastic product can depend on the year you bought it, Vandenberg said.

Since March 2010, items Tupperware sells in the US and Canada are BPA-free, according to its website.

CNN has contacted Tupperware for comment but has not received a response.

ìWe worry about those hard, shatter-resistant plastics that were made a decade ago, that were made with BPA,î Vandenberg said. ìEvery single time that theyíre used, theyíre leaching small amounts of BPA out of them. Ö Even the low levels of BPA that leach from consumer plastics, canned food linings or other consumer goods Ö have been shown to be associated with harm, and people certainly should care about it.

ìIf itís not safe the day you buy it, itís not safe 10 years later,î Vandenberg said. In fact, the longer you own them, the riskier they are for your health, she added.

Risks of container wear and tear
Putting stress on plastic food containers by washing them in the dishwasher or with rough scrub brushes ìincrease the ability of that plastic to leach whatever it was made out of,î Vandenberg said. Scratches can create deep grooves for bacteria to reside in as well, said James Rogers, director of food safety research and testing at Consumer Reports, a nonprofit research, testing and consumer advocacy organization.

Putting highly acidic foods ó such as tomatoes or citrus fruits ó in these products does the same thing, Vandenberg said.

The ìmicrowave safeî label on some plastic containers doesnít mean the product is totally safe from a health standpoint, she added.

ìSome of the plasticizers and chemicals can transfer from the plastic containers into the food during heating,î Rogers said. ìSo we totally advocate that you transfer your food from a plastic container into a glass bowl and microwave it that way.î

Discoloration of a container can signal that a chemical change has occurred in the plastic, Vandenberg said. ìUsually that is happening because thereís lots of little micro-holes or micro-tears,î she explained. ìAnd now thereís an interaction with the food and the plastic (because the plastic is degrading). So if the plastic is discolored, itís telling you that that plastic is breaking down.î

Any damaged plastic food storage containers should be discarded, said Sam Cole, global director of product certification, food equipment and chemicals at the National Safety Foundation, an organization facilitating development of public health standards and certification programs for the protection of food, water, consumer products and the environment.

BPA in the body
The majority of daily exposure to BPA happens through diet, according to the US Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. ìThe reason why we worry about BPA is that, going all the way back to the 1930s when it was tested for use as a pharmaceutical, it was clear that it acts like an estrogen,î Vandenberg said. ìEstrogen is a pretty powerful hormone that is important for reproduction and fertility, but also really important for the development of sex organs, development of the brain and controlling metabolism.

ìIt has a role in muscle development and fat development,î she added. ìSo even small amounts of tinkering with the estrogen or estrogen pathways in our body can have really serious outcomes for our health.î

The shape of the molecules in BPA make it more likely to bind to estrogen receptors, Vandenberg added. ìI avoid using those reusable plastics as much as possible, because I have yet to see good evidence that there are consumer plastics that are free from estrogenic properties.î

Generally, plastics with the label ìPCî (for polycarbonate) or recycling codes three or seven likely contain BPA, according to Vandenberg and the US Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.

Plastic food storage alternatives
Some manufacturers have been phasing BPA and other bisphenols, sometimes called analogues, out of their products due to public attention ó rather than regulatory action ó but not all, Vandenberg said.

ìThink about replacing them with something thatís chemically inert, like glass,î Vandenberg said. ìIf you canít afford to replace everything all at once, replace them one at a time.î

ìI know itís heavy, it can break and all the rest of that, but we think that the advantages to using glass containers for storing food and reheating food outweigh the risks,î Rogers said.

You can also opt for porcelain, ceramic or stainless-steel containers, especially for hot foods and liquids, according to Vandenberg and the US Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.

Why we have nightmares and how to stop them,"CNN
 ó 
We leave behind our fears of monsters under the bed as we say goodbye to our childhoods, but one can follow us into adulthood and loom over our heads.

Nightmares are more common in childhood, but anywhere from 50% to 85% of adults report having occasional nightmares.

Almost everyone can experience nightmares.

ìDreams do usually incorporate things that happened during the day, leading some researchers to hypothesize that dreams and rapid eye movement sleep is essential for memory consolidation and cognitive rejuvenation,î said Joshua Tal, a sleep and health psychologist based in Manhattan.

ìNightmares are the mindís attempts at making sense of these events, by replaying them in images during sleep.î

Nightmares are what the American Academy of Sleep Medicine call ìvivid, realistic and disturbing dreams typically involving threats to survival or security, which often evoke emotions of anxiety, fear or terror.î

10 ways sleep can change your life

If someone has frequent nightmares ó more than once or twice weekly ó that cause distress or impairment at work or among people, he or she might have nightmare disorder. Treatments include medications and behavioral therapies.

Addressing frequent nightmares is important since they have also been linked to insomnia, depression and suicidal behavior. Since nightmares can also cause sleep deprivation, they are linked to heart disease and obesity as well.

Trying out these 10 steps could help you ease your nightmares and improve your sleep and quality of life.

1. Establish a sleep routine
Create a nighttime routine to improve the quality of your sleep and reduce nightmares.

Nightmares occur during rapid eye movement sleep, the phase during which our muscles relax and we dream. Waking up during REM sleep enables recollection of the dream and resulting distress, said Jennifer Martin, a professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, and member of the American Academy of Sleep Medicineís board of directors.

ìOne of the most effective ways to treat nightmare problems in adults is actually to get them sleeping more soundly (so) they wake up less often,î Martin said.

A healthy sleep routine begets sound sleep. Develop one by exercising, setting regular sleep and waking times, ensuring your room is dark and cool, avoiding stimulating beverages after midafternoon and engaging in relaxing activities.

2. Cut back on alcohol
Alcoholic beverages can induce restlessness and awakenings throughout the night ó potentially helping you remember nightmares, Martin said.

ìA lot of people use alcohol as a way to wind down and feel sleepy at the end of the day, but itís really not the right solution,î she added. Instead, try herbal teas and other beverages conducive to sleep. If drinking was the only part of your relaxation routine, chat with your partner or read instead.

One drink more than three hours before bedtime is OK, Martin said. Just pay attention to whether it causes a post-dinner nap and alertness at bedtime, and eliminate that drink if it does.

3. Donít eat before bed
Avoid snacking before bed to prevent spiking your metabolism and activating your brain.

Snacking can boost metabolism, which causes your brain to be more active and could lead to nightmares, according to the National Sleep Foundation.

While some people sleep better after eating a light snack, you should stop eating two to three hours before bedtime. If you notice that you have nightmares afterward, try avoiding nighttime snacking or heavier meals before bed.

4. Review your medications
Some medications can prompt nightmares by interrupting REM sleep.

ìIf people can identify that their nightmares either started or increased when they had a change in their medication, thatís definitely a reason to talk to their doctorî about their medication schedule or alternatives, Martin said.

Melatonin, while a popular sleep aid, influences our circadian rhythm that regulates REM sleep, and can lead to more or fewer nightmares. If you want to take melatonin for better sleep, work with a sleep specialist to ensure youíre taking it at the right time and not compounding the problem, Martin said.

5. Practice stress-relieving activities

ìNightmares activate the sympathetic nervous system, the ëfight or flight system,í the bodyís natural response to imminent danger,î said Tal via email.

ìThe body also has an innate relaxation system: the parasympathetic nervous system, aka the ërest and digestí system.î Progressive muscle relaxation and other relaxation activities can help activate that system.

6. Journal your worries
Journaling can help you release your anxieties.

Write down your worries to get them all out ahead of time, lest they rear their disquieting heads at night. Journaling can be helpful for alleviating nightmares and stress in general, Tal said.

7. Donít watch or read scary content before bed

Since our nighttime observations can appear during sleep, ìspend some energy engaging with things that are more emotionally neutral or even positiveî before bedtime, Martin suggested.

During the pandemic, our everyday lives are looking pretty scary, too. ìReading the news media and then hopping into bed is more likely to trigger disturbing and upsetting dreams than looking through pictures from your last vacation with your family,î she added.

8. Rewrite the ending
Imagery rehearsal therapy is effective ìwhen the chronic nightmares are showing similar themes and patterns,î Tal said.

Since nightmares can be learned behavior for the brain, this practice involves writing down in detail the narrative elements of the dream. Then rewrite the dream so that it ends positively. Just before falling asleep, set the intention to re-dream by saying aloud, ìIf or when I have the beginnings of the same bad dream, I will be able to instead have this much better dream with a positive outcome.î

ìBy practicing a rewrite during the daytime, you increase your chances of having them at night while youíre sleeping instead of your nightmare,î Tal said.

9. Use a white noise machine
Silence is key in a sleep routine, but ìfor people who either donít like it to be completely quiet or who are awakened by noises they canít control during the night,î background noise ìis a good strategy,î Martin said.

Your guide to finding the right Theragun massage gun for you,"CNN) ó  
If youíre one of those people now working out at home more than ever before, you probably think you already have all the workout gear you need. You snagged dumbbells, a yoga mat, resistance bands and all the other major essentials ó or so you thought. One device you might have overlooked, however, is the massage gun, a percussive therapy device that enhances recovery after intense workouts.

Massage guns like the Theragun have been gaining traction on social media for a while now, but theyíre not just overpriced toys that make mesmerizing slow-motion videos. If you get a good one, it can be a legitimate therapeutic device that has been shown to help prevent delayed onset muscle soreness by promoting blood flow to your muscles.

Therabody
Therabody's Theragun Elite

If you want to get your hands on a massage gun, thereís good news. Theragun (which has been renamed Therabody) is one of the most popular massage gun brands out there, beloved for its high-quality products with sleek designs, and it just dropped a whole new line of percussion therapy devices. The new lineup from Therabody includes four massage guns: Theragun mini (Cyber Monday special: $174, regularly $199; theragun.com), Theragun Prime (Cyber Monday special: $224, regularly $299; theragun.com) Theragun Elite (Cyber Monday special: $299, regularly $399; theragun.com) and Theragun Pro ($449, originally $599; theragun.com).

With this exciting release, we wanted to get our hands on a few devices to see how they stack up and if theyíre really worth your money. We tested and compared the Theragun mini, Theragun Elite and Theragun Pro for their power, performance and convenience. Not only did we want to note the differences between the devices, such as speed and power, but we also wanted to look at other factors such as ease of use and noise. Each device has its own quirks and benefits, so to help you find the best one, weíve put together this guide.

We think the Theragun mini is the most exciting and innovative massage device Therabody has put out yet. Its Cyber Monday special $174 price tag (regularly $199) is the lowest of the lineup, making it an amazing introductory device.

The Theragun mini solves a lot of the accessibility problems that seem to come with massage guns. The narrative is usually that theyíre bulky and loud and cost way more than what youíd ideally like to spend. Thatís been changed with the miniís tiny size and low price.

While it doesnít pack as big a punch as the Elite or Pro, the Theragun mini has top speeds of 2,400 percussions per minute, matching the more expensive models. However, it doesnít provide as much depth or power with its 12-millimeter amplitude, which translates to how far the massager head moves up and down, and 20 pounds of stalling force, which is how hard you can push on it before it stops. (The commercial-level Pro, for comparison, charts a 16-millimeter amplitude and 60 pounds of stalling force.) Despite this, the mini provided us with enough percussive power for a relaxing massage.

Like many, weíve been working out more due to stay-at-home orders, so having a massage gun handy was a true blessing for sore hamstrings. The mini was powerful enough to blast the stiffness out of our legs after a hard workout, plus it was quiet enough that we could watch Netflix while doing so.

Another perk of the miniís tiny size is its mobility. You can reach just about anywhere and comfortably apply enough pressure for a deep massage. The only place where it was difficult to apply adequate pressure was the middle of the back. The triangular design of the other Theraguns helps reach your back without twisting your arms. Since the mini is so light (1.4 pounds), the odd arm angles needed to hit those more difficult areas didnít tire out our wrists or arms as much as other models.

What we found most impressive was this little guyís battery life. On Therabodyís site, the mini is said to have up to 150 minutes of sustained run time. When we conducted our own test, we turned all the Theraguns up to a 2,100-PPM setting and let them buzz and buzz. They all performed at or above the listed times, but the mini kept chugging along for a ridiculous five and a half hours. It finally died after 345 minutes.

Itís small but mighty, and we really love the Theragun mini. With three speed settings (1,750 PPM, 2,100 PPM and 2,400 PPM), it has enough power to dig pretty deep into muscles, and its low cost, ease of use and lack of bells and whistles make it one of the most accessible massage devices on the market.

We didnít test the Theragun Prime hands on, but its specs place it as the most basic of the three triangular-shaped Theraguns. With a 16-millimeter amplitude and 30 pounds of stall force, itís more powerful than the mini and provides enough percussive power for the everyday workout. But if you have nagging problems that need some more intensive work, youíll want to opt for the Elite or the Pro.

The Prime has all the basic features of the more expensive devices, but at a more reasonable Cyber Monday special price of $224 (regularly $299). At 2.2 pounds, it weighs the same as the Elite, so based on our experience with that model (see below), the Prime should be quite easy to move around to hit all parts of your body without straining your arm, hand or wrist.

The battery has a listed run time of 120 minutes, but based on our tests with the other models, we wouldnít be surprised if it lasts even longer. The Prime comes with four attachments: the dampener, standard ball, thumb and cone.

This device is also the first in the lineup to be equipped with Bluetooth capabilities. You can pair the Prime, Elite or Pro to Therabodyís companion app, which guides you through certain workouts and even allows you to control the speed right from your phone. It has five built-in speeds ó 1,750 PPM, 1,900 PPM, 2,100 PPM, 2,200 PPM and 2,400 PPM ó that you can toggle through if you donít want to use your phone.

If you just want the essentials of a massage gun without many extra features, the Theragun Prime is a great option with its ergonomic shaping and hefty motor. If youíre looking for more convenience or even more power, check out the Elite and Pro.

The Theragun Elite is the next iteration of Therabodyís most popular massage gun, the Theragun G3 (which is now discontinued). The fourth generation brings loads of improvements, like more speed settings, a more powerful motor and much longer battery life.

Therabody claims the Elite is 75% quieter than the previous generation, and while we couldnít test that firsthand, we can confirm that it is surprisingly quiet. We had to turn up the television a couple of notches while using it, but the Elite wasnít obnoxiously loud even during a neck massage (though we still wouldnít recommend any late-night massage sessions if you have roommates in close quarters trying to sleep).

So how is the Elite, which costs almost $100 more at the special Cyber Monday price of $299 (regularly $399), better than the Prime? The main improvements are a higher stall force, which means you can get deeper into those sore muscles; a force meter that displays on a new OLED screen, which helps you gauge just how hard youíre pushing; an additional attachment (the wedge); wireless charging capabilities; and the ability to locally store preset routines on the device. None of these is a game changer by itself, but combined, they make the Elite a much more well-rounded product, with both better performance and convenience than the Prime.

When we tested the Elite, we really enjoyed its triangular shape. Since itís heavier than the mini, at 2.2 pounds, the ergonomic hold was needed to make it easier to target harder-to-reach areas like the back. We used the Elite in tandem with the app, which made the massage experience feel like an actual regimented workout instead of just blasting those sore quads willy-nilly. On the app, you can select routines for specific body parts like forearms or the lower back to help you target your aches and pains. You can also choose a massage routine that helps with relief from specific activities like running, tennis or even traveling on a plane (though we wonít be doing that anytime soon).

Theragun Elite

Once you select the routine, the app tells you which attachment to use, where to hold the device and how to move it around for the best results. It even has a timer that counts down and lets you know when to switch areas (from the left side of your back to the right, for example).

The battery on the Elite, like the others we tested, exceeded expectations. Itís listed as having a run time of up to 120 minutes, but ours lasted for an impressive 197 minutes. Thatís more than enough time for multiple recovery sessions before a charge.

Unfortunately, after we concluded our testing of the Elite, we attempted to update it ó but it turned off and wonít turn back on again. Still, with a 30-day money-back guarantee and a one-year warranty, it wouldnít be an issue to swap it out for another one.

The Theragun Elite lives up to its name as a premium percussive device in design, performance and price. At $299 for Cyber Monday, it takes quite a chunk of cash, but the Elite can revamp your muscle recovery in easy-to-use and effective ways.

Theragun Pro

If you need the best of the best, or are looking to add a massage gun to your arsenal as a personal trainer, thereís no doubt the Theragun Pro should be your weapon of choice. The Pro adds an adjustable arm and swappable batteries and packs a much bigger punch than all the other Theraguns in the lineup. Plus, it comes with a two-year warranty, compared with the one-year warranty that comes standard with the other devices in the release.

The Theragun Pro has an amplitude of 16 millimeters with 60 pounds of stall force. That means you can apply massive amounts of pressure to get deep into your tissues for the ultimate massage recovery. We tried pushing it into our muscles to get it to stall and it took a couple of tries. You can basically push as hard as you want with the Pro without worrying about it stopping.

The biggest advantage in comparison with the rest of the lineup is definitely the Proís adjustable arm. It has four positions that allow you to really hit all the parts of your body while maintaining a comfortable grip. We would swap the positions with the click of a button to better target that aching back, or just make it more comfortable to hold while we hit other areas like calves or forearms. We can only imagine how useful it would be for a professional physical therapist.

Theragun Pro

Another great feature of the Pro is its swappable batteries. They pop in and out easily for a quick switch if one dies, and each lasts 150 minutes, giving a combined run time of up to 300 minutes. When we ran our battery test it landed right on the mark, with one battery lasting 145 minutes.

The Pro was the loudest of all the Theraguns we tested but was by no means headache-inducing. The highest speed applied to the neck can be a little rattling, but even so the Pro sounds surprisingly smooth for how powerful it is. We think its construction helps with this, as the Pro has a matte, grippy covering in contrast to the shiny, hard plastic of the Elite. The hard plastic could rattle around, making the device louder, but the Pro didnít have that issue.

The Theragun Pro has all the features youíd ever want from a high-end massage gun. Its price is lofty with a Cyber Monday special price of $449, regularly $599, but itís an investment worth making for any hardcore athlete or health or fitness professional whoís in the market for a massager.

The bottom line
Therabodyís new line of fourth-generation Theraguns is a nice next step in the field of percussion therapy. Our favorite is the Theragun mini, which is the most accessible massage gun Therabody has ever made. It provides a solid massage experience in a tiny device that wonít break the bank at $174 for Cyber Monday (originally $199).

The Theragun Prime and Elite are a few steps up from the mini, with the Prime giving you just the essentials and the Elite offering more performance and convenience. At $299 and $399, they are pricey, but with the companion app, they provide an easily implemented recovery routine that can help you feel better after any workout.

The Theragun Pro is truly a top-of-the-line massage gun, perfect for any athlete who needs the best recovery or for a working physical therapist. The two-year warranty gives a little more peace of mind for the $599 investment. It has key features that set it apart from the other Theraguns, including a ridiculous 60 pounds of stall force and the adjustable arm.

So whether youíre new to massage guns or youíre looking for a top-notch upgrade, Therabodyís new Theragun line can percussion away your problems, no matter your needs or your budget.

8 activewear brands you should add to your workout wardrobe,"CNN
 ó 
The increasing popularity of stylish, trendy athletic wear has made ¸ber-comfortable clothing something thatís not just for the gym. Itís infiltrated all corners of culture, from high fashion runways to the offices of Silicon Valley executives ó and really, itís appropriate for any occasion when you just want to be comfortable.

A key thing to keep in mind when searching for your next piece of activewear is the type of activity or exercise you prefer: Whether youíre a runner, yogi, lifter, cyclist or anything else, thereís a trendy athleisure brand out there for you. We were able to test some of these pieces hands-on so we could really see where each brand shines bright. So if youíre ready to upgrade your closet and kill those workouts in style, check out these eight activewear brands that we absolutely love ó from established ones to newer direct-to-consumer options.

Alo Yoga
Alo Yoga was created in 2007 as an activewear brand specifically for yoga lovers, but it has since evolved into one beloved by everyone from the barre-obsessed and Pilates loyalists to celebrities as a street style option. And thereís a really good reason for that.

aloleggings
The brandís super-soft and comfortable activewear is probably the most luxurious-feeling gym clothing Iíve ever worn. It may not be the best option for someone who runs marathons or works with heavy weights, but it provides a little luxury if you prefer lower-impact exercises like yoga or barre. When it comes to the leggings, both the 7/8 High-Waist Airbrush Legging ($78; aloyoga.com) and the High-Waist Airlift Legging ($118; aloyoga.com) are extremely soft, comfortable and flattering.

The High-Waist Airbrush Legging is probably Alo Yogaís most classic legging. There are no side seams, and itís made from the brandís signature Airbrush fabric that features moisture-wicking antimicrobial technology. Itís the perfect option to take you from the gym to just about anywhere and has been spotted on celebrities like Gigi Hadid. The High-Waist Airlift Legging feels like a second skin; itís buttery and sleek while still supportive. Theyíre super high-waisted, making them a great choice to pair with a whole range of crop tops or sports bras.

Alo Yoga tops
Alo Yoga tops Alo Yoga
While we didnít test any of Aloís current tops, weíve worn some of its older long-sleeve products, which felt warm and lightweight. The brand also has tons of other tops, including the bestselling Real Bra Tank ($72; aloyoga.com), that can keep you supported and stylish through all your workouts. This tank has a built-in shelf bra that provides light to medium support so you can go straight from yoga class to the cafÈ around the corner without skipping a beat.

Working out in these pieces, and in Alo Yogaís products in general, definitely feels a little more special than wearing your typical workout clothes. And though theyíre probably not the most supportive workout options on the market and better suited for lower-impact activities, we can guarantee that theyíll garner tons of compliments both outside and inside the studio.

Girlfriend Collective
Girlfriend Collective is a brand that prioritizes slow fashion ó which means investing time and energy ó to produce clothing thatís more ethical and easier on the planet. Take the Compressive High-Rise Legging, for example, Girlfriendís signature legging thatís made from 25 recycled water bottles. And though many synthetic fabrics (like nylon and polyester) are made from plastic, Girlfriend chooses materials ìthat would otherwise clog landfills and threaten wildlife.î

girlfriendlead
But youíre not sacrificing quality when you shop at Girlfriend. In fact, itís quite the opposite. The Compressive High-Rise Legging ($68; girlfriend.com) and Paloma Bra ($38; girlfriend.com) are some of the most inexpensive options on this list, which makes their super-high-quality feel that much more impressive.

The Compressive High-Rise Leggings really do some incredible work when it comes to lifting your backside. Theyíre also extremely high-waisted, which is great if you donít want to worry about pulling up your leggings during a workout. Both the leggings and the Paloma Bra are sweat-resistant and comfortable in warmer environments, though theyíre not the most lightweight, which we actually prefer for everyday wear.

The Paloma Bra is fairly long as well, so if youíre buying these two pieces together ó which we highly recommend, because everyone will be asking where you got your adorable set ó your whole stomach wonít be exposed. Another interesting element is the lack of visible branding; there are no loud logos on the back of the leggings, which we found refreshing.

girlfriend2
The best part is the customization thatís available, both in terms of fit and style. The Paloma Bra is available in sizes XS through XXXL, and the Compressive High-Rise Legging runs from sizes XXS to 6XL, with the additional option of choosing from three inseam lengths. Yes for inclusivity! And when it comes to colors, thereís absolutely something for everyone.

One of our favorite elements of Girlfriendís better-for-the-planet philosophy is exemplified in the ReGirlfriend program, which encourages customers to send in old Compressive bras, leggings and shorts for a $15 store credit. Girlfriend then recycles the old materials into new ones, which helps close the loop on creating more waste. So maybe there isnít too much harm in ordering a piece in every single color?

Lululemon
If youíre looking for brand recognition, youíll be hard-pressed to find a piece of activewear more ubiquitous than Lululemon leggings. Popular with yogis, runners and influencers alike, athletic wear from the popular brand is famed for its fashionable look and unbelievably soft materials.

Lululemonís Align Leggings ($98; lululemon.com) pretty much have their own cult following, thanks to buttery soft Nulu fabric and their flattering shape. If you havenít splurged on a pair of Lululemon leggings yet, the Align collection might just be the place to start. Not only does it include leggings, but it also features bike shorts, super-high-rise options, wide-leg pants and even tops perfect for all types of exercises.

Lululemon
Lululemon Lululemon
But Lululemon offers so much more than the Align collection, with pieces for any sort of lifestyle, whether youíre going on runs every day or just want some comfy clothes to lounge around in. Its series of sports bras are nearly as popular as its leggings, and its Energy Bra line is fit to handle any workout. Available in cup sizes B through D, these versatile sports bras come in high neck and long line options too.

If youíre embracing the WFH life, Lululemon has tons of oversize, comfy options for you as well. From cozy hoodies and sweaters to luxurious joggers and pants, you can find anything you need to snuggle up indoors all day.

Lululemon is one of the most popular brands in the athleisure space, and for good reason. Its wide selection of stylish, comfortable and versatile apparel will carry you through nearly any workout.

FP Movement
Free Peopleís activewear collection features a uniquely boho style that sets it apart from other brands. From the wide range of distinctive colors to stretchier, looser fabrics and cuts, the little details in the brandís pieces make them a fun step up from your typical athleisure basics.

freepeople1
The playful element of the brandís aesthetic is apparent in its Good Karma set, which includes the Square Neck Good Karma Bra ($48; freepeople.com) and High-Rise 7/8 Length Good Karma Leggings ($78; freepeople.com). Both pieces are available in a huge range of colors, from wardrobe-necessary neutrals to bolder, brighter options like neon yellow, tropical pink and a super-bright blue.

Theyíre made from a combination of spandex and nylon, and as a result theyíre incredibly stretchy and body-hugging ó which is important since the pieces are available in only two sizes. While they held up well during our workout classes, we found ourselves turning to them outside of exercising as well. These pieces easily double as everyday clothing, and the wider waistband on the leggings lends a slightly more dressed-up look.

When it comes to special little touches, the High-Rise 7/8 Length Youíre a Peach Leggings ($98; freepeople.com) absolutely won our hearts. To start, theyíre the perfect leggings to work out in. Theyíre thick enough to be completely squatproof ó no need to worry about your underwear showing through ó and theyíre made of the type of reliable material that you donít have to worry about ripping.

freepeople2
The 7/8 length is perfect even for those who are petite, and the ruched detail adds a fun touch. The leggings have a high waist that sits perfectly, and the real showstopper? The light-reflective accents that both keep you visible if youíre working out at night and accentuate your curves.

And finally, the Hit the Slopes Fleece Jacket ($148; freepeople.com) is a unique and stylish take on a typical fleece jacket. The button snaps are really high quality, and the multiple zippered pockets mean you never have to bring a bag or purse to the gym again.

Carbon38
Carbon38 both curates super-stylish activewear and creates its own line of products. And when it comes to head-turning, high fashion-inspired pieces that will have the trendy women in your life in awe of a cropped sweater, Carbon38 is absolutely your destination.

CARBON381
The signature High Rise 7/8 Takara Legging ($105; carbon38.com) is something we havenít really seen before. The material is sleek, with a glossy finish that isnít quite as dramatic as it looks in pictures on the site (so no worries if it looks a bit intimidating in the image ó itís gorgeous but not totally liquidy). We paired it with the Cami Bra ($68; carbon38.com), which matches perfectly, for probably the most fashionable workout set weíve ever seen, let alone tried on.

The material is compressive, and the large waistband on the High Rise 7/8 Takara Legging is super comfortable. Again, this might not be the activewear you run a marathon in, but itís perfect for meeting friends for lunch. And thatís what distinguishes Carbon38 to us as an activewear brand ó itís really a fashion brand that uses activewear as a way to incorporate comfy but trendy pieces into your everyday life.

carbon382
The Crop Tank ($39; carbon38.com) is, simply put, one of the softest tank tops weíve ever tried. Itís the perfect cropped length to pair with high-waisted leggings, and just sheer enough to show off whatever cute sports bra you have on underneath.

Spanx
Spanx started out with shapewear, but since its beginnings, the brand has expanded and now makes stellar leggings and activewear as well.

Its Faux Leather Leggings ($98; spanx.com) are immensely popular, and itís easy to see why. We tried them out for ourselves and adore how stretchy, breathable and stylish they are. They have a high-waisted design and contoured waistband, and theyíre center seam-free ó so whether youíre out running errands or doing some yoga at home, youíll be comfortable and chic.

Spanx Faux Leather Leggings
Spanx Faux Leather Leggings Nordstrom
If youíre looking for more traditional activewear, Spanx has got you covered there too. The brand offers sports bras, bike shorts, more leggings and even an exercise skort. The Get Moving Skort ($72; spanx.com) is another one of Spanxís most popular items, equipped with a built-in liner that wicks away sweat and moisture. Plus, it even has pockets so you can keep your phone and keys nearby when youíre out working up a sweat.

The brand also offers a wide range of sizes and inseams, including petite and tall fits, which is a huge bonus if you can never find a pair of leggings that fit just right. So if you want ultimate comfort and style during even your hardest workouts, look no further than Spanxís collection of leggings, tops and other essentials.

Sweaty Betty
When it comes to sweatproof activewear for anyone who loves a good workout, Sweaty Betty is the winner in our book. The brand has been around for over 20 years now, and in that time it has absolutely nailed apparel thatís both ideal for the studio or gym and perfect for everyday wear.

sweatybetty1
We wore the Power Mesh 7/8 Workout Leggings, which have since been replaced with a meshless pair called the Power 7/8 Workout Leggings ($100; sweatybetty.com). The pair we tried were made from a sleek fabric that feels like itís optimized for performance. They were extremely sweatproof, and the material almost gets more comfortable as you work out. The current Power Workout Leggings are made from the same material.

Something to note, however, is that the Power 7/8 Workout Leggings arenít high-waisted, which makes them a great option if you prefer to wear leggings with a longer tank top as opposed to a sports bra or crop top. Weíre a big fan of the back zip pocket, which (though it didnít fit our iPhone XR) is the perfect size for keys, a credit card and some cash.

sweatybetty2
We also tried the Athlete Seamless Workout Tank ($48; sweatybetty.com) and the Stamina Sports Bra ($40; sweatybetty.com), and the Athlete Seamless Workout Tank is exactly what it sounds like: a super-versatile tank ideal for just about any activity we can think of. Itís sweat-wicking, flattering and works perfectly with any pair of leggings.

While some gym clothes sort of hug your curves and accentuate them, we found that all the Sweaty Betty products were more compressing and really held everything in. For this reason, we imagine the leggings and tank top would be great for runners, boxers and those who prefer higher-impact workouts.

The Stamina Sports Bra is designed to offer medium support up to a C cup, and we found it ideal for lower-impact activity. That being said, itís a sports bra so comfortable you can wear it to the gym and keep it on all day long. Itís not restrictive or bulky, and it paired perfectly with the Athlete Seamless Workout Tank. The pieces we tried performed so well during sweaty workouts and still felt clean and lightweight post-sweat sesh.

Outdoor Voices
Outdoor Voices is a brand that has completely embraced all things athleisure as a lifestyle. It stresses the idea of ìfreeing fitness from performanceî and believes activity can be a part of anyoneís everyday life ó and its activewear reflects that.

Outdoor Voices carries a wide range of activewear for different types of activity. Our absolute favorite piece from the collection is the Exercise Dress ($100; outdoorvoices.com), which weíve written about in depth before. In many ways, it exemplifies everything that Outdoor Voices has nailed as an activewear brand: Itís super versatile, great for activity that intertwines with your everyday life (like hiking, jogging, walking with friends or biking) and brings something playful, simple and unique to the activewear space.

ov1
In true Outdoor Voices fashion, itís not about performance ó itís about comfortable, functional pieces that work with whatever your lifestyle is.

In terms of more traditional workout gear, we tested the Doing Things Bra ($58; outdoorvoices.com) and found it to be comfortable and supportive, though it wasnít completely sweatproof in our experience. During a barre class, we had some sweat gather in the middle of the sports bra and show through. So we would definitely recommend this for outdoor or more casual activity where you wonít be sweating heavily.",13-Jan-21,health, Noelle

Florida becomes second state in US to ban fluoride in public drinking water,"Florida has become the second state in the nation to ban the addition of fluoride to public drinking water.

On Thursday, Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the Florida Farm Bill, which includes language banning the use of any additive in a public water system that does not meet the new definition of a ìwater quality additiveî: a chemical or substance used in public water to specifically address drinking water standards, contaminants or quality.

ìYes, use fluoride for your teeth, thatís fine. But forcing it into the water supply is basically forced medication on people,î DeSantis said. ìThey donít have a choice. Youíre taking that away from them.î

More than 70% of Floridians who use community water systems receive fluoridated water, according to Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, who issued guidance in November recommending against community water fluoridation, citing its potential health effects.

What to know about fluoride in drinking water

Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral thatís found in soil, rocks and water to varying degrees. It is also a byproduct of fertilizer production. On the recommendation of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, many cities have added fluoride to their treated drinking water for decades to help protect teeth from cavities.


The CDC reiterated its faith in the health benefits of fluoride in 2015, naming water fluoridation one of the ì10 Greatest Public Health Achievements of the 21st Century.î The ADA has also emphasized that ìeighty years of community water fluoridation at optimal levels has proven to be safe and effective at reducing tooth decay to improve oral health.î

However, research has showed that exposure to fluoridated water during pregnancy is associated with increased neurobehavioral problems in children, and a federal review concluded that higher levels are linked with lower IQ in kids.

Utahís ban on fluoride in public water is a simple change that raises complicated new health risks, experts say


US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pledged to roll back CDC recommendations that fluoride be added to municipal drinking water and has promised that a panel of experts will review the guidelines and make new recommendations.


Kennedy canít formally prevent communities from adding fluoride to their drinking water, but some states and cities have followed his lead. In March, Utah became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water.

The US Food and Drug Administration also said this week it is starting the process to remove prescription fluoride tablets and drops from the market. Theyíre typically prescribed for babies and children who are at high risk of tooth decay because they drink water that doesnít contain added fluoride."," May 16, 2025",health,Katherine Dillinger,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/15/health/florida-fluoride-ban,,,,,,,,,,,,florida become second state nation ban addition fluoride public drinking water thursday gov ron desantis signed florida farm bill includes language banning use additive public water system meet new definition ‚Äúwater quality additive‚Äù chemical substance used public water specifically address drinking water standards contaminants quality ‚Äúyes use fluoride teeth that‚Äôs fine forcing water supply basically forced medication people‚Äù desantis said ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt choice you‚Äôre taking away them‚Äù floridians use community water systems receive fluoridated water according florida surgeon general dr joseph ladapo issued guidance november recommending community water fluoridation citing potential health effects related article datafluoridefinaljpg know fluoride drinking water fluoride naturally occurring mineral that‚Äôs found soil rocks water varying degrees also byproduct fertilizer production recommendation us centers disease control prevention world health organization many cities added fluoride treated drinking water decades help protect teeth cavities cdc reiterated faith health benefits fluoride naming water fluoridation one ‚Äú greatest public health achievements st century‚Äù ada also emphasized ‚Äúeighty years community water fluoridation optimal levels proven safe effective reducing tooth decay improve oral health‚Äù however research showed exposure fluoridated water pregnancy associated increased neurobehavioral problems children federal review concluded higher levels linked lower iq kids related article dissected human teeth displayed office dentist dr james bekker april salt lake city utah ap photohannah schoenbaum utah‚Äôs ban fluoride public water simple change raises complicated new health risks experts say us health human services secretary robert f kennedy jr pledged roll back cdc recommendations fluoride added municipal drinking water promised panel experts review guidelines make new recommendations kennedy can‚Äôt formally prevent communities adding fluoride drinking water states cities followed lead march utah became first state ban fluoride public drinking water us food drug administration also said week starting process remove prescription fluoride tablets drops market they‚Äôre typically prescribed babies children high risk tooth decay drink water doesn‚Äôt contain added fluoride
"Lawmakers press Kennedy on mass cuts, canceled medical research","Lawmakers repeatedly pressed US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy on canceled medical research and mass layoffs during Wednesday hearings on Trump administration proposals that could lead to even broader cuts.

Democrats on the House Appropriations Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies subcommittee repeatedly asked the secretary to explain cuts this year to health care programs, medical research and staffing before discussing a 2026 budget that would shrink the health agencies further. Kennedy also testified before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on Wednesday afternoon.

Kennedy insisted he would spend the funds that Congress appropriated in the 2026 budget according to law. But Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee, including ranking member Steny Hoyer and health subcommittee ranking member Rosa DeLauro, were focused on the agencyís spending this year, for budgets already authorized.

ìWe have to really keep a clear line here between a questionable proposal for ë26 and what is going on right now against the legislation that we have passed and that has been signed into law,î DeLauro said.

Trump administration cut $2.7 billion in NIH research funding through March, Senate committee minority report says

The administrationís cancellation of National Institutes of Health grants amounted to $2.7 billion in eliminated research, much higher than previous estimates, according to a report issued by Democrats on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on Tuesday.


In a post on X on Tuesday, HHS called the report ìunequivocally falseî and said it was politically motivated.

The secretary defended HHS funding and job cuts in the House subcommtitee hearing, saying that the slashes had reduced redundancy and that the proposed 2026 budget would streamline programs further.

But he also seemed to distance himself from the eliminations led by the US Department of Government Efficiency and said he had protected certain programs, including HeadStart.

ìThere were many instances where I said ëThat would hurt us,í î he told the House committee.

Questions on vaccination
Kennedy also told House lawmakers Wednesday that Americans should not take advice from him on vaccinations.


ìMy opinions on vaccines are irrelevant,î he said. ìEverybody should make that decision. I seem like Iím being evasive, but I donít think people should be taking advice, medical advice, from me.î

The comments came after Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wisconsin, asked Kennedy whether he would vaccinate his children against measles today. ìProbably for measles,î the secretary answered before adding that vaccination is a personal choice.

Pocan followed up with questions about whether Kennedy would vaccinate his children against chickenpox and polio today. Kennedy noted that chickenpox shots are not required in Europe and said again he did not want to be seen as advising families.

ìWhat weíre trying to do is to lay out the pros and cons accurately, as we understand them,î he said.

Kennedy has previously disclosed that his children received the recommended childhood schedule of vaccines when they were younger. As founder of the nonprofit Childrenís Health Defense, he has also criticized that schedule and claimed that the side effects of certain vaccines ó including unproven links to autism ó outweigh their benefits.


The secretary announced in April that health agencies would start a massive research and testing effort to distill the causes of autism, citing ìenvironmental toxinsî and other exposures.

Efforts to tackle racial disparities
In his opening statement at the House subcommittee hearing, Kennedy said that one of the top priorities for the agencyís budget was to ìeliminate DEI funding and redirect resources toward real poverty reduction.î

Democratic Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey pushed him on the topic, highlighting vast racial disparities in maternal mortality in the US and other health issues.


ìFew things enrage me more than the racist attacks I see this administration carrying out by embarking on an ignorant crusade to rid the government of any programs that are working to improve the lives of Black Americans,î Watson Coleman said. ìThe administration has moved to ban the words Black, race, bias, minority, oppression, prejudice, discrimination, disparity and racism. Any grant application on federal programs that include these words had them immediately stripped.î

HHS cuts 10,000 employees in major overhaul of health agencies

These actions are an attempt ìto legitimize racial discrimination,î she said, and low-income minorities will suffer the consequences most.

ìIt should not be controversial to make right a health care system that was not built to help people like me, to take my concerns, my pain, my health very seriously in this country,î Watson Coleman said. ìHow exactly will HHS banning the words that we use to describe ourselves make us healthier?î


Kennedy said that President Donald Trump has a vision for a ìcolorblind administration,î akin to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.ís ideals.

ìThe commitment is there. Weíre just reorganizing,î he said.

But he balked when Watson Coleman pressured him for rationale behind eliminating a program to help low-income households with their energy bills to have heat in the winter and stay cool in the summer: the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP.

ìMy time has expired,î Kennedy said.


ìWell then, so has your legitimacy,î Watson Coleman said.

Only when prompted to follow up did Kennedy offer a brief explanation, saying that the administrationís broader energy policy aims to bring energy costs down in general.

ìIf it doesnít happen, then Congress is welcome ñ and they should ñ appropriate the money for LIHEAP, and I will spend it,î Kennedy said. îI already allocated $400 million from LIHEAP during the last 100 days, and I will continue to do and get that funding to the people who need it in this country if the fuel costs do not go down.î

Lead program cuts
Kennedy suggested at the Senate hearing that experts in the US Centers for Disease Control and Preventionís lead poisoning prevention program were fired in error during the agencyís sweeping cuts in April.


During questioning by Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, on the impact that the lead program cuts might have on a lead contamination crisis in Milwaukee public schools, Kennedy agreed that childhood lead poisoning is ìan extremely significant concern.î

Baldwin then asked, ìDo you intend to eliminate this branch at CDC? Yes or no?î

ìNo, we do not,î Kennedy said.

Itís the second time Kennedy has suggested that lead experts at the CDC were cut in error. When asked during an appearance in April about cuts to the program, he responded, ìThere are some programs that are being cut that are being reinstated. I believe thatís one of them.î


An HHS spokesperson later said that the CDCís lead program wouldnít be reinstated but that the work would continue through a different CDC office, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.

However, experts in the CDCís lead program have not been rehired, according to Dr. Eric Svendsen, who was director of the CDCís Division of Environmental Health Science and Practice, which included the lead poisoning prevention program.

The entire division and all of its programs were cut during the April 1 layoffs. ìWe are all still RIFd,î Svendsen confirmed Wednesday.

Asked for clarification Wednesday, an agency official told CNN, ìAs HHS finalizes its detailed reorganization plans, the Department will be looking into all strategic programs and priorities for the Secretary and the nation. The work of this program will continue.î

Kennedy has reinstated some other workers at CDC. In an exchange with Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington earlier Wednesday, Kennedy said that he had reinstated 328 workers with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in Morgantown, West Virginia, and another site. Those offices worked on mine safety and on health issues in first responders after the response to the September 11 attacks, he said.


ìThe work on mine safety will continue,î Kennedy said. ìWe understand itís critically important function. And I did not want to see it end.î

Murray said other NIOSH workers, including those at an office in Spokane, Washington, have not been reinstated, however.

ìI would just say you canít fire 90% of the people and assume the work gets done,î she said.

Micah Niemeier-Walsh, vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3840, representing NIOSH employees in Cincinnati, said in a statement Wednesday that ìSome NIOSH employees have been reinstated, however, many critical functions of NIOSH remain negatively impacted by the Reductions in Force. Ö The union is determined to continue to advocate for full reinstatement of all NIOSH employees. All NIOSH programs are important for the health and safety of working peoeple in this country.î


Some workers at the US Food and Drug Administration have also had their firings reversed, including staffers handling Freedom of Information Act requests, those who negotiate user fees and some laboratory staff.

Additionally, more than a dozen scientists at the FDAís Moffett Lab in Illinois focusing on food safety had their RIF notices reversed, according to a person familiar with the situation who declined to be named because theyíre not authorized to speak on behalf of the agency.

"After NIH staffing cuts, cancer patient in clinical trial worries she may lose crucial time","With the future of her cancer treatment in limbo, Natalie Phelps doesnít know how much longer she can wait.

Last month, after months of seeking treatment options for her colorectal cancer, the 43-year-old mother of two was accepted into an ongoing study at the National Institutes of Health. She thought the research would allow her to receive an experimental immunotherapy ñ but she now faces an excruciating wait and an equally excruciating choice.

First, her tumor must grow to at least 1 centimeter in size in order to receive treatment, she said. But even after she meets that criteria, an abrupt reduction in the NIH workforce means her treatment will take much longer to develop than initially expected. Sheís worried that that extra time may make a huge difference in her health.

The Trump administration has been conducting a review of funding and a restructuring of the US Department of Health and Human Services, resulting in massive waves of job cuts across federal health agencies under HHS, including the NIH, the nationís medical research agency.

Immunotherapy helps certain cancer patients avoid surgery: ëWe hope this is the futureí

Part of the HHS transformation involves decreasing the NIH workforce by about 1,200 ìby centralizing procurement, human resources, and communications across its 27 institutes and centers,î according to the Trump administration. The administration announced in late March that the HHS restructuring would save taxpayers $1.8 billion per year through an overall reduction of about 10,000 full-time employees.


Phelps said that some of the scientists working on her NIH trial were among the cuts.

Phelps was diagnosed with stage IV colorectal cancer in 2020, at age 38. She was nearly eight months pregnant at the time and originally thought her symptoms ñ abdominal pain, irregular bowel movements and mucus in her stool ñ were probably due to pregnancy or hemorrhoids. But as her symptoms worsened, she had a colonoscopy that found a tumor in her rectum. Further testing confirmed that it was cancer and that it had spread to her liver.

Phelps has had surgery to remove the initial tumor, radiation therapy, three liver surgeries and 48 rounds of chemotherapy. Yet the cancer has continued to spread, she said, which is why she has been eager to try immunotherapy through the NIH trial ñ and is worried about the wait.

Trial delay ëcould cost them their lifeí
Immunotherapy is a form of cancer treatment that harnesses a personís own immune cells to target and fight the disease. The NIH trial specifically involves a T-cell receptor-based therapy in which Phelpsí immune cells were collected through a blood draw, she said. Once her tumor grows to meet the criteria, the cells will be engineered to target her cancer, she said.


But the time it may take to engineer the cells for that next step has expanded from four to eight weeks because there are not as many researchers working on the trial as before the NIH staff cuts, Phelps said.

ìSo hereís the tricky part: Should I continue staying off chemo and hope a tumor grows to meet the 1-centimeter threshold, or give up on clinical trials for now?î Phelps said. Giving up on the trials would mean a return to traditional chemotherapy and radiation to treat her cancer.

She was told that the NIH team will work to engineer her cells at a faster rate than others in the trial so it wonít take eight weeks, but the process will still take weeks.

Overall, ìgoing from four to eight weeks is a huge deal for people with metastatic cancer,î Phelps said, adding that it could lead to further complications or even be life-threatening.


ìJust to give you a personal example, at the end of March, my scan showed I had disease that was stable, and my blood work showed that my tumor antigens were coming down. It was at a number of 43 for something called a CEA,î Phelps said. This carcinoembryonic antigen test measures levels of the CEA protein in the blood, as certain cancers like colorectal may cause high levels.

ìOne month later, my disease had spread to my bones, all of my lymph nodes, and my CEA marker was 203. Thatís in one month, in four weeks,î she said. ìFor some patients, it might not be a huge deal. For other patients, like me, it is, and it could cost them their life.î

The reductions in NIH funding and staff are happening at a time when colorectal cancer cases have been rising among younger adults. A report released in 2023 by the American Cancer Society said that the proportion of colorectal cancer cases among adults younger than 55 increased from 11% in 1995 to 20% in 2019.

ìThe rates of cancer amongst people younger than 50 are on the rise, and they tend to be aggressive and later-stage cancers,î Phelps said. ìSo it makes zero sense, if you care about keeping America healthy, to reduce your medical research at a time when you have cancer rates rising in your younger population that are the ones working and driving the economy.î


Phelps added that if she could wave a magic wand, she would wish for ìall the cancer research to be restored to where it was before this administration started.î

ëYou donít care about Natalieí
US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was asked at a Senate committee hearing Wednesday about NIH staff cuts and Phelpsí case specifically.

Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, said during the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing that Phelpsí ìbest hopeî is the NIH clinical trial.


Kennedy said that if Murray contacts his office, he can help.

ìI donít think that should happen to anybody,î Kennedy said of Phelpsí case.

ìWell, what have you ñ and I mean you personally ñ done to assess how those staff cuts are impacting patient care? She is one of many,î Murray asked.

ìI provided the guidelines that said no clinical trials should be affected by the cuts,î Kennedy responded.


ìMr. Secretary, I just have a short amount of time ñ they are impacting clinical trials,î Murray interrupted.

ìYou asked me the question. Do you want me to answer it?î Kennedy retorted.

Their heated exchange continued.


ìI offered to help her, but you donít care. You donít care about Natalie,î Kennedy said. ìIíve offered to help Natalie.î

Murray then pressed him about proposed cuts at the NIH.

ìI think the cuts that are now proposed by NIH are going to hurt,î Kennedy said. ìThereís no agency head in the government, like myself, that wants to see their budget cut.î

Murray asked for a personal update on Phelpsí case from Kennedyís office in the next 24 hours, as well as details about the state of NIH clinical care.


Later in the hearing, Kennedy said that his team had identified Phelpsí case and that she has not met the criteria to receive treatment in the trial.

ìIt had nothing to doî with the reduction in force at the NIH, he said. ìNone of our clinical trials were shut down because of the RIF. That was a canard.î

Murray later responded that she spoke with Phelps directly and that it was her doctor at the NIH who told Phelps that staffing cuts were having an impact.

ìThe issue, as I stated clearly, was the delay in care,î Murray said. ìMy staff has put in inquiries with HHS leadership, and theyíve been unresponsive so far. And just to make it clear, this is just one case of many.î

Federal health overhaul
HHS ìremains committedî to advancing cancer research, spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in an email.


ìHHS deeply values cancer research and remains committed to advancing life-saving scientific studies that improve patient care and outcomes to Make America Healthy Again,î he said.

When plans for the restructuring of HHS were announced in late March, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. described them as an effort to allow the department to do more at a lower cost to taxpayers.

ìThis overhaul will be a win-win for taxpayers and for those that HHS serves,î he said.

Trump administration cut $2.7 billion in NIH research funding through March, Senate committee minority report says

A new Senate HELP Committee minority staff report, released Tuesday and authored by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, found that the Trump administration cut $2.7 billion in NIH research funding in the first three months of this year ñ including a 31% reduction in cancer research funding from January through March compared with the same timeframe last year.


In a post on X in response, HHS called Sandersí report ìunequivocally falseî and ìa politically motivated distortion that undermines the thousands of dedicated public health professionals across HHS, who remain steadfast in their commitment to delivering results for the American people.î The post added that HHS is ìstreamlining programs, eliminating redundancies, and ñ above all else ñ prioritizing gold standard science.î

Itís estimated that at least 1 in 5 people with cancer in the US participate in some form of medical research.

ìClinical trials are a key part of delivery of care to patients. At a large academic center, such as all the large cancer centers, clinical trials are deeply ingrained into patient care ñ and without clinical trials, advances in delivery of care to patients will not be made. Itís only through clinical trials that high-quality data about new treatments and cures can be developed,î said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, who has been following the changes at the NIH.

ìI can also say that terminating multiyear research projects midway leads to a lot of waste of taxpayersí dollars, because there has already been substantial investment in a project,î he said. ìSo if you end a study when itís halfway done or three-quarters of the way done, then thereís no benefit to either science or to patients after there has already been substantial investment.î","May

Late abortions are rare. The US just lost a clinic that offered the procedure for over 50 years,"To fellow travelers, Hannah Brehm likely looked like she was taking a belated babymoon well into her third trimester.

But she and her husband had received a crushing diagnosis: Their babyís brain was not developing properly, upending their wanted pregnancy. Medical experts warned moving forward would likely mean her son would know only pain and suffering. The Minnesota couple wasnít going to take that chance.

Instead, they went to Colorado, where for decades the Boulder Abortion Clinic served as a resource for women who looked to terminate their pregnancies in the second or third trimester because of medical reasons, like Brehm, or other circumstances.

After more than 50 years, that clinic quietly closed last month, leaving the U.S. with just a handful that offer abortions after 28 weeks into pregnancy ó many on a case-by-case basis.

The 87-year-old clinic founder, Dr. Warren Hern, says he is deeply upset: ìIt became impossible to continue, but closing is one of the most painful decisions of my life.î


Anti-abortion advocates have celebrated the closure, calling it a step forward in protecting mothers and unborn children. While the overwhelming majority of abortions take place in the first trimester, former patients and reproductive rights advocates worry about the impact of losing an already narrow resource.

ìChances are itís not gonna happen to you. And I hope it doesnít happen to someone else that you love, but it is happening,î Brehm said, reflecting on her experience in 2022.

Reasons for late abortions
Federal data shows just 1% of abortions come after 21 weeks of pregnancy, but experts believe that number is higher because some states, including California, donít give the feds their abortion statistics.


The reasons for late abortions vary. Some diagnoses like anatomy abnormalities or genetic disorders canít happen until after 20 weeks or later into pregnancy. Other women may not find out theyíre pregnant until after the first trimester. Millions of women live in a state with a strict abortion ban.

Sarah Watkins traveled from Georgia to the Boulder clinic in 2019 just before 25 weeks into her pregnancy after learning her baby had a condition called trisomy 18, an extra chromosome that made it likely the baby would die in utero or shortly after birth. A genetic blood screening at 10 weeks previously dismissed chances of the condition, but a detailed ultrasound in the second trimester proved otherwise.

ìYou can do everything right, by the book, but you still canít find out certain things until that ultrasound at 20 weeks and sometimes even later,î she said. ìAnd as a mom, I did not want her to feel a single moment of hurt or suffering or pain or discomfort. Thatís why I made the decision.î

Watkins described the medical care she received at the Hernís clinic attentive and caring. Nevertheless, she said traveling to a place with multiple layers of bulletproof glass and a throng of protesters was a traumatic experience.

Hernís reach through the decades
For years, Hern was the only provider in the U.S. to offer later abortions, starting in 1973 and developing specialized techniques and even innovating certain tools to ensure better health outcomes. But offering abortions late in pregnancy came with risks.


He and his medical team received constant death threats. Someone shot through the windows of the clinic five times in 1988. Five of Hernís colleagues who offered similar services were assassinated throughout his career, including the 2009 slaying of Dr. George Tiller in Kansas.

When Hern announced the clinicís closure in late April, the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America declared the news as a ìVICTORYî in a social media post.

Hern said the work was always worth it. He recalled one of his first patients who couldnít believe the cleanliness of his operating room; she previously had an illegal abortion that left her humiliated and frightened.

ìShe looked up at me and said ëPlease, donít ever stop doing this,íî Hern said. ìSo I didnít. Until now.î


In the end, financial issues made it almost impossible to operate the clinic. Hern said patients increasingly were having trouble paying for the procedure, which hovers around $10,000 and is often not covered by insurance. Longtime personal donors were also dwindling.

Hern worked with physicians over the decades, hopeful that one day they would take over his clinic, but that never worked out.

ìI had to make a decision really, you know, sort of on the basis of the situation at the moment that we couldnít continue,î he said. ìIt was very, very painful. I see this as my personal failure.î

Providers and patients wonder whatís next
According to the Later Abortion Initiative by Ibis Reproductive Health, fewer than 20 clinics provide abortions after 24 weeks into pregnancy in the U.S. ó though that number isnít considered comprehensive and excludes hospitals and a handful of other clinics for security reasons.


Currently, the group lists three clinics ó in New Mexico, Maryland and Washington, D.C. ó that provide services after 28 weeks. Five others ó in Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Washington state ó will consider patients depending on physician recommendations or fetal and maternal conditions.

ìI think Dr. Hern has been the torchbearer for abortion leaders in pregnancy,î said Jane Armstrong, a licensed therapist in Texas who now helps support families who have terminated pregnancies for medical reasons. She ended her own pregnancy around 21 weeks in 2021.

ìWho will pick up the mantle? We really do need a new torchbearer right now.î

A dozen states have bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy and four more have bans that kick in after about six weeks. Abortion fund organizations, which help people arrange and pay abortions, say the bans mean a higher demand for later abortions. When people travel, it often takes more time to make appointments, gather the money needed and to catch a flight or take a drive hundreds of miles away.


ìEvery time a clinic closes, it does impact everybody and what kinds of care they give,î said Anna Rupani, executive director of Fund Texas Choice.

Shortly after the nationís highest court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, an all-trimester abortion clinic opened in Maryland ó a partnership between certified nurse-midwife Morgan Nuzzo and Dr. Diane Horvath, an OB-GYN who specializes in complex family planning.

They said theyíre worried about many things when it comes to reproductive rights, including the Trump administrationís move to curtail prosecutions against people accused of blocking access to abortion clinics and reproductive health centers. But theyíre also buoyed by the consistent overwhelming number of applications from providers whenever they post a position, and said that the number of clinics that offer later abortions has gone up since Roe was overturned.

ìThis type of care is still available,î Horvath said. ìItís more rare than it was a couple weeks ago, but we want to say loud and proud that our doors are still open and there are other places still open.î","May 13,2025",health,Associated Press,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/13/health/colorado-abortion-clinic-closure,,,,,,,,,,,,fellow travelers hannah brehm likely looked like taking belated

The†gift†of†life:†A†visual†history†of†organ†transplantation,"There were more than 48,000 organ transplants in the United States last year. Theyíre commonplace now, but the practice was considered experimental only a half-century ago.

Until just the past few years, transplants almost always involved human organs. Now, early experiments in xenotransplantation ó transplanting animal organs into humans ó are creating potential pathways to save lives.

Hereís a look back at how we got to this point.

Are animals the answer?
Pigs that have been genetically edited to make their organs more compatible with the human body are the latest frontier in organ transplantation.

Xenotransplantation, the practice of transplanting organs between species, is a concept that has been around for hundreds of years.

Early in the 20th century, Dr. Mathieu Jaboulay turned the idea into action with one of the first well-documented attempts to make an animal organ work for a human. In 1906 in Lyon, France, Jaboulay attached a pig kidney to a 48-year-old womanís elbow, choosing that spot because it was easy to access. Blood circulated through the kidney, and the kidney produced urine, something even some human donations in this period failed to do, studies show.


The pig kidney quickly failed, and the patient died soon after due to an infection.

ìThe lack of having ready access to human organs has always sort of been the holy grail, that you would have something in reserve that didnít require a human to die in order for another human to live,î said Dr. Jeffrey Stern, a senior member of the NYU Langone Transplant Instituteís xenotransplantation team. ìObviously, animals as that source is sort of an ideal version of that.î

The first successful human transplant

In 1954, the worldís first successful human organ transplant was performed by Dr. Joseph E. Murray at whatís now called Brigham and Womenís Hospital in Boston.

Murray took a kidney from 22-year-old Ronald Herrick and transplanted it into Richard Herrick, his twin brother. Because they were identical, Richardís immune system thought the new organ was its own, which prevented it from rejecting the foreign organ. Richard Herrick lived another eight years, and his organ donor brother had no harmful side effects.


ìI think that really moved the field,î said Dr. Stefan Tullius, chief of the Division of Transplant Surgery at Brigham and Womenís Hospital.

ìWhat that did show is that if you have the right combination and relationship between donor and recipient, then you indeed can transplant an organ and that is going to work,î Tullius added.

Since immunosuppressive drugs were not yet available, transplant experiments seemed to work only with twins whose immune systems thought the foreign organ were their own.

ìYou still ran into all those issues for the next 30 years with the immune system,î said Stern, who is also an assistant professor in the Department of Surgery at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. ìNot everyone has an identical twin.î

More donors

In the 1960s, Murray demonstrated in several experiments with dogs that an organ transplant would be more successful if the recipient received drugs to suppress the immune system after the procedure, to lower the chances of rejection.

In April 1962, in a world first that built on what he learned from those experiments, Murphy transplanted a kidney from a deceased donor into an unrelated human who was treated with an immunosuppressant called azathioprine. The patient survived more than a year, and s survival time lengthened even further when doctors discovered that an immunosuppressant worked better if given along with the steroid prednisone.


In June 1963, one of Murrayís research fellows, Belgian surgeon Dr. Guy Alexandre, performed the first transplant operation from a brain-dead donor, a controversial procedure at the time. Alexandre had been searching for a kidney for a patient with renal failure when a woman who had been in a car accident was brought in to his HÙpital Saint-Pierre in Brussels. Her heart was beating, but she showed no brain activity. Knowing that organs lost viability as soon as a patientís heart stopped, Alexandre got permission from his department chair to transplant the womanís kidney into his patient with renal failure. The recipient lived another 87 days.

Over the next couple of years, Alexandre secretly performed other kidney transplants using brain-dead donors to see if such an approach would lengthen survival time compared with transplants from donors whose hearts had stopped. He disclosed the experiments at a medical conference a couple years later, to mixed reactions.

It wasnít until 1968 that a Harvard Medical School committee published its recommendation that irreversible loss of brain function ñ once called ìirreversible comaî ñ would be a new criterion for death. Afterward, transplants involving brain-dead donors became more common, vastly expanding the pool of available organs.

ìTo come up with the definition of brain death as an alternative to cardiac death ñ so the discontinuation of circulation ñ was huge, because it allowed the procurement of organs,î Tullius said.

Trial and error

Transplant doctors started experimenting with kidneys because humans have two and can survive with only one. Patients also had the option of dialysis if the transplant failed. But the more the doctors learned, the more confident they became that they could transplant other organs.

By the late 1960s, they started to experiment with livers and pancreases, and in 1967, South African surgeon Dr. Christiaan Barnard of Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town performed the first heart transplant. He transplanted a 25-year-oldís heart into a 53-year-old grocer who was dying from chronic heart disease. The grocer died 18 days later from a lung infection, but the heart continued to beat until his death.


Barnardís second heart transplant patient lived almost 19 months. His fifth and sixth patients lived for almost 13 and 24 years, respectively.

By the 1990s, immunosuppressants like cyclosporine and tacrolimus opened new possibilities for transplants of multiple tissues. In 1998, Dr. Jean-Michel Dubernard did the first surgical hand transplant in Lyon, France. In 2005, he and Dr. Bernard Devauchelle performed the first partial face transplant for Isabelle Dinoire, a woman who lost part of her face in a dog attack. In 2010, a Spanish team led by Dr. Juan Barret performed the first full-face transplant.

ìThereís the first 30 years of transplantation that everything was sort of experimental, right?î Stern said. ìIt wasnít a commonplace endeavor that we do what we currently do, and it was a lot of trial and error and survival, and sort of the entire field of transplantation, I think, was very tenuous in that. It was adaptation and invention of new technologies that allowed transplantation to become commonplace.î

Baby Fae

In 1984, Dr. Leonard Bailey tried to save the life of Stephanie Fae Beauclair at Loma Linda University in California. The child, who became known as Baby Fae, was born with a deadly heart condition, and Bailey, who had been experimenting with cross-species transplants in animals, got permission to transplant a baboon heart. Stephanie lived just 21 more days, but the case generated more awareness about the need for infant organ donations and the possibility of cross-species transplantation.

Eventually, scientists decided that primates, although evolutionarily the closest cousin to humans, werenít the best organ donors.


ìPrimates turned out to be too small, too expensive and too controversial,î said medical ethicist Dr. Art Caplan, who works with transplant cases at NYU. There was also a concern about infection. Non-human primates may carry a variety of pathogens that are not harmful to them but that can cause disease in humans, including Marburg virus and HIV.

Eventually, scientists realized that pigs would be a better option: Theyíre anatomically similar to humans, they breed quickly, and there was a reduced risk of zoonotic disease.

Nobel-winning technology

Research in xenotransplantation stalled until the development of the gene editing tool CRISPR in the early 2000s. This Nobel-winning technology gave scientists the ability to edit the pig genome to make it more compatible with humansí, including knocking out key sequences in pig DNA that would result in almost automatic organ rejection in people. Combining that with cloning techniques gave scientists a chance to maintain consistent genetics and produce universal pig donors.


ìCloning and to apply CRISPR, to have the opportunity of gene editing, is really allowing not only transplantation but is also relevant for other areas of medicine,î Tullius said. ìI would put those in the revolutionary category.î

One step closer

Pig organs had been transplanted into non-human primates, but the real test came in September 2021, when a genetically engineered pig kidney was transplanted to a brain-dead patient at NYU Langone.

The kidney was attached to the blood vessels in the recipientís upper leg, outside the abdomen, for 54 hours while doctors studied how well it functioned. The organ seemed to function as well as a human kidney transplant, and the doctors did not see any signs of rejection.


ìWe learned more from that than anything else that weíve done,î Dr. Robert Montgomery, one of the surgeons who performed the procedure, told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. ìIt was really the basis of how we were able to figure out how to treat rejection in our living patients.î

ìThe family graciously approved donation of their loved oneís body for this procedure. That extraordinary generosity paved the way for this major step forward in creating a sustainable supply of life-saving organs and hopefully ending the current paradigm that someone has to die for someone to live,î Montgomery said in a news release at the time.

Making history
Surgeons at the University of Maryland Medical Center prepare the pig heart to be transplanted into David Bennett University of Maryland Medical Center
On January 7, 2022, surgeons at the University of Maryland School of Medicine performed the first xenotransplant into a living person.


David Bennett, 57, could not walk and relied on an artificial lung and heart bypass machine to stay alive. He was too sick to qualify for a human heart but was able to undergo the experimental procedure under the US Food and Drug Administrationís compassionate use pathway, which allows patients with no other alternatives to try experimental treatments.

He lived two additional months, having the chance to spend more time with his family and watch the Super Bowl.

ìAs with any first-in-the-world transplant surgery, this one led to valuable insights that will hopefully inform transplant surgeons to improve outcomes and potentially provide lifesaving benefits to future patients,î said his surgeon, Dr. Bartley Griffith.

Bennett was the first of a handful of compassionate use xenotransplant patients. But as researchers approach clinical trials, they hope they will have a better understanding of how successful the organs can be under more typical circumstances.


ìThe promise of xenotransplantation is the promise of hope for our patients. A hope for the future that for too long has been uncertain. It is hope turned to possibility turned to reality. Our patients can dream again about graduations, weddings Ö about life. Hope should not have to be rationed,î said Dr. Jayme Locke, a professor of surgery at NYU Langone.

ìMultiple shots on goalî is how geneticist Dr. David Ayares describes United Therapeuticsí approach to the future of organ transplantation.


This summer, the company will embark on the first FDA clinical trial of xenotransplantation.

ìSo instead of one-off compassionate use transplants that were very valuable in learning how to optimize and extend the survival of these patients, now we can go into a multicenter trial,î Ayares, president and chief scientific officer of Revivicor, a United Therapeutics subsidiary, told Gupta.

But that still wonít be enough to solve the organ shortage completely, so United Therapeutics and others in the transplant community are continuing to think farther into the future. ìI think the next thing weíre going to do is Ö create personalized organs where we donít have to use any immunosuppression,î Montgomery said of what he expects down the road.

This could mean using a pigís organ as scaffolding where scientists could seed human stem cells, or even 3D-printing organs.

ìThen you have a designer organ for that person when they need it,î Montgomery said.","May

"Dr.†Sanjay†Gupta:†At†the†forefront†of†organ†transplants,†patients†are†the†pioneers","The story of transplants has always been one of altruism. After all, organs can be neither sold nor purchased. They can only be donated as a gift of life.

It is a story that started in 1954, when Dr. Joseph Murray performed the worldís first successful organ transplant at Bostonís Peter Bent Brigham Hospital between identical twin brothers Ronald and Richard Herrick. Richard had been discharged from the US Coast Guard after being diagnosed with end-stage kidney disease, and his identical twin brother, Ronald, was a willing donor. Although they had no certainty it would work, the transplant resulted in eight more years of life for Richard, successful in part because they had the same DNA.

When Ronald died in 2010, Dr. Murray remembered him in a statement published in the American Journal of Transplantation, saying: ìwe should never forget that he not only saved his brother Richardís life, but also paved the way for thousands of other transplant recipients throughout the world.î

It is this same ethos that is now pushing forward the burgeoning field of xenotransplantation ñ the practice of using animal organs for human transplant.

For the past two years, Iíve spoken with surgeons, genetic engineers and patients who have all told me of the hope of using genetically engineered pig donors to help end the organ shortage crisis. In the United States alone, there are more than 100,000 people waiting for an organ at any given moment ñ most of them in need of a kidney. Every day, 17 people on that list will die, just waiting.

He was tired of just surviving. A pig kidney gave him a shot at living

ìThis paradigm that someone has to die in order for somebody to live is, a broken paradigm. It just doesnít work,î said Dr. Robert Montgomery, director of the NYU Langone Transplant Institute. As both a transplant surgeon and a heart transplant recipient himself, he knows how agonizing the wait can be. Itís why heís relentlessly pushing for a new source of organs.


ìBecause less than 1% of the people who die every year die in a way that they could ever even be considered as organ donors, we need a sustainable, renewable source of organs from something else other than humans dying,î Dr. Montgomery told me.

In many ways, the idea of using pigs is not all that far-fetched. After all, we have been using pig heart valves to replace human valves since the 1970s. The drugs heparin and insulin were initially derived from pigs. Because of their similarity in size to humans, a pigís organs are a pretty good match for us. And our long history of breeding them and their ability to produce large litters in just under four months makes them a reliable, steady and speedy source of potential organs.

It was the more recent development of CRISPR and genetic engineering that has truly accelerated the field of xenotransplantation. Scientists can now modify a pigís DNA so that its organs are more compatible for human transplant, controlling for rejection, growth and possible viruses.


But just as with the Herrick brothers, all of this heady science requires pioneering patients willing to take the chance and raise their hands despite the unknowns.

In January, surgeons from Mass General successfully transplanted a genetically modified pig kidney into Tim Andrews of Concord, New Hampshire.

Sixty-six-year-old Tim Andrews had been on dialysis for two years. He had end-stage kidney disease, and the likelihood that he would get a transplant was extremely low in part because of his rare blood type. Doctors put the chances of him finding a match within the next five years at just 9%. The likelihood of him dropping off the list altogether in that same time period because of illness or death was nearly 50%.

Dialysis had worn on Tim so much that he had resigned himself to the idea that he might literally die in the dialysis chair.


For those not on dialysis, it can be hard to understand just how grueling it can be, both mentally and physically. But think of it like this: Our kidneys are always working, filtering blood 24/7. A dialysis machine tries to do all that work, but compresses it into three or four days a week, a few hours each time. It was so stressful on Timís body that he had a heart attack six months after starting dialysis.

When he learned that his hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, had performed the first experimental pig kidney xenotransplant, he told his doctor, Dr. Leonard Riella, that he had to be given a chance.

Even though he knew there was tremendous uncertainty about the outcome of the transplant, Tim pushed forward. When I visited Tim and his wife, Karen, at their home in Concord, New Hampshire, he told me, ìIt may shorten your life, but youíre going to do something for humanity. And Iím like, oh, God, thatís what itís all about.î

At the time, 53-year-old Towana Looney was the only person in the world who could understand what Tim was contemplating. Twenty-five years earlier, Towana had donated one of her kidneys to her mom, but two years later, she developed pre-eclampsia during pregnancy, and her remaining kidney was damaged. Like Tim, she was unlikely to find a match anytime soon, in her case because of high antibodies. She had been on grueling dialysis for eight years before undergoing the transplant in November 2024 at NYU Langone. Dr. Montgomery was her transplant surgeon. Her life was transformed, and when I saw this vibrant womaen on stage talking about her experience, I was amazed at how healthy she looked. Afterward, Dr. Montgomery told me, ìShe wants to start a revolution.î

In April of this year, Towana had to have her kidney removed after she developed an infection unrelated to the organ that required her immunosuppression regimen to be lowered. At the time, she had lived with the genetically modified pig organ for 130 days, the longest period of time ever recorded.


In a statement, Towana said, ìIím so grateful to have been given the opportunity to be part of this incredible research. For the first time since 2016, I enjoyed time with friends and family without planning around dialysis treatments. Though the outcome is not what anyone wanted, I know a lot was learned from my 130 days with a pig kidneyóand that this can help and inspire many others in their journey to overcome kidney disease.î

These are still early days, and so there will be ups and downs, but in science, like life, you learn just as much from the failures as the successes. Each step forward has been building on the lessons learned from previous patient pioneers, like David Bennett and Lawrence Faucette. They both received pig hearts and lived an additional six to eight weeks. Rick Slayman and Lisa Pisano received pig kidneys in 2024, and both lived about two additional months after their procedures. In each case, their stories taught scientists valuable and transformative lessons about the field of xenotransplantation.

This spring, I had a chance to visit with Brittany Rydel, Lisa Pisanoís daughter. She told me, ìMy mom always cared about other people. And one of the first things she said to me was, ëEven if this doesnít work for me, it can work for someone else.í And I think about that a lot. You know, I might need a kidney one day. My kids might need a kidney one day. ì

Lisa Pisano, 54, faced heart failure and was on dialysis to manage end-stage kidney disease. At NYU Langone in 2024, she became the second living person to receive a pig kidney. The organ was removed after 47 days.

The baton of altruism and hope passed on again.

So often, it is the scientists and the researchers who are recognized ñ and for good reason. After all, the story of xenotransplantation is possible because of several Nobel Prize-winning discoveries, including transplanation, gene editing, cloning, IVF and immunology. As Dr. Montgomery told me, ìWe stand on the shoulders of giants for sure.î

The real giants propelling this field forward, however, are the patients bravely stepping into the unknown for the benefit of all of us.","May

He†was†tired†of†just†surviving.†A†pig†kidney†gave†him†a†shot†at†living,"Tim Andrews knew that he needed dialysis to manage his end-stage kidney disease, but over months of treatment, he started to wonder whether it was worth it. He was exhausted and hopeless. He missed his grandkids.

It kept him alive, but it didnít feel like living.

Desperate for another option, he found a surprising alternative: an organ from a pig.

Andrews, 67, is a pioneer of a new kind of medicine. In January, he had an experimental cross-species transplant of a kidney from a genetically modified pig. He is one of only a handful of patients who have undergone the experimental procedure. For now, heís the lone person in the United States known to be living with a pig kidney.

Andrews knew that there was a risk to trying something so new, but if the kidney gave him just one more day free from dialysis, it was worth it ó for him and for fellow patients.


ìThis will do something for humanity,î Andrews said.

ëPick a boxí
Andrews had been living with diabetes since the 1990s, managing the condition with insulin. About 2Ω years ago, he went to the doctor feeling unusually tired. Tests showed that he had stage 3 kidney failure ó his kidneys were still working but less efficiently than they should. He was relieved to learn that it was manageable with medication, monitoring and lifestyle changes.

But about a month later, a doctor delivered more bad news: Andrewsí kidney disease had rapidly progressed to end-stage disease. Dialysis was the only option to keep him alive until he could get an organ transplant.


Dialysis is highly effective at cleaning the blood, but it places a ìhuge burdenî on the body, Andrewsí doctors told CNN. At first, Andrews thought it was going well. But about six months in, he had a heart attack.

ìIt takes a toll on you, emotionally and physically,î said Andrews, who lives in New Hampshire.

Experimental transplants with organs from gene-edited pigs see major steps forward

He was tempted to forgo dialysis entirely until a doctor warned that if he did so, he should ìpick a box.î With the state his kidneys were in, his body would be in it within a couple months.


For six hours, three days a week, he kept at it. On days off, heíd sleep. By the time he woke up, heíd have to start the process all over again.

When he thinks about his experience with dialysis, Andrews appreciates what the doctors and nurses did to keep him alive. But when he kept having to sit in that oversized green chair hooked up to the dialysis machine, the whole situation hurt his spirit, too.

He was too tired to walk or get groceries. He couldnít eat. Even in the few hours he felt OK, his immune system was so weak that he had to avoid crowds. Dialysis meant no more Red Sox games, no more fun with grandchildren, no more travel.

Tim Andrews takes Dr. Sanjay Gupta to his former dialysis center.

As the hours ticked past, he couldnít think about gratitude. All he could think about was death.

The dialysis side effects got so bad that he wanted to quit, but his wife, Karen, wouldnít let him. He also kept hearing his fatherís voice in his mind, telling him to stop complaining and start doing something about his situation.

ëI know what end-stage meansí
Andrews learned that his odds of getting a human kidney donation were not good.


Nearly 90,0000 people are on the waiting list for a kidney in the US. Most donít get a transplant because they become too sick or die while waiting for a match.

Andrewsí chances were slimmer than most because of his rare blood type. People typically wait about three to five years for a donor kidney. For him, it would likely be seven to 10 years. Doctors thought his body could take only five years of dialysis.

ìI was a little short there,î Andrews said. ìI know what end-stage means.î

But his research gave him hope. Massachusetts General Hospital was also investigating animal alternatives. He demanded that the hospital liaison put him in touch with one of the doctors from that project: Dr. Leonardo Riella, medical director of kidney transplantation at Mass General.


When they first met, Andrews was ìvery frail,î Riella said. He arrived in a wheelchair. But when Riella mentioned whatís known as xenotransplantation ó transplants using genetically modified pig organs ó Andrewsí eyes ìsparked.î

ìHe said ëTell me what I need to do.í î

Riella told Andrews heíd need to get a lot stronger if he wanted a transplant of any kind.

ìThey said, ëPrepare your body for battle,í î Andrewsí wife, Karen, remembered.


For the next few months, Andrews went to the gym and physical therapy, got his teeth fixed, got several vaccines and lost 22 pounds.


When he went back to the clinic a few months later, Riella said, Andrews was ìalmost running around the room.î

He talked to people about the procedure. He prayed. His wife, Karen, also had to agree: If they got the green light, she would need to sign consent papers. On the slim chance he got a virus from the organ, sheíd be exposed to it, too.

ìI was a little taken aback by that,î Karen said. But she didnít have any doubt that this transplant, though unusual, was the right way to go.

ìIt has to be better than dialysis,î she said. ìHe was just feeling so awful all the time.î

A new birthday
In January, it was finally time.


On surgery day, his family hugged and kissed him good-bye. Karen gave him a high-five and wished him luck.

The procedure was supposed to take four hours, but only about two hours and 15 minutes in, Karen said, her phone rang. The doctors were done early and said it went ìunbelievably well.î

The pig kidney is prepared before Tim Andrews' transplant. Doug Moon/Mass General Brigham
A team of doctors told Karen that they had successfully attached the genetically modified pig kidney alongside Andrewsí nonfunctioning organ.


ìThey put the kidney on the table and started connecting him to the kidney, and he actually peed across the room,î Karen said, laughing. Everyone in the operating room started cheering.

ìOf course, I started bawling like a baby,î Karen said.

It all happened so fast that even the doctors who did the surgery were surprised.

ìIt worked right away, and the numbers started getting better,î Riella said.


After waking up from surgery, Andrews felt ìreenergized and revitalized.î

ìI was alive, and I hadnít been in a long time,î he said.

He hopped off the bed and tap-danced across the room, he said. His mind felt clear.

ìIt was a miracle,î Andrews said. So much so, he declared that he had a new birthday.


ìI said ëlook at me, itís like Iím like a new man,í î he said. ìItís like new birth. I said, ëIíve got a new birthday. 1/25/25 is my new birthday.í î

ëNow I can do anything I wantí
After the transplant, Andrews spent a week in the hospital but only out of an abundance of caution.

In the months since, heís had a few ìsmall bumps in the road,î including a three-week hospital stay. But the pig kidney does what a kidney from a living human donor would do.

Life is returning to normal. Andrews cooks, vacuums and takes long walks with his dog, Cupcake.

He currently takes more than 50 pills every day as the doctors try to figure out the type of medications heíll need with his new kidney. But living without dialysis has made such a difference.

ìBasically, I was just sleeping, sick all the time. Now I can do anything I want,î Andrews said.

He even lets himself picture a future. He canít wait to see his grandkids again.

ìThey saw me at the lowest, and now theyíll be able to see me alive and laughing and carrying on like Grandpa does,î Andrews said.

If all goes well, he hopes to take Karen to Europe in a year. He said theyíve put it off far too long.

ëItís a learning curveí
Still, Andrews knows that the pig kidney may not work long-term. Heís still on the wait list for a human organ. If the pig kidney can act as a bridge that keeps him healthy enough to wait for a match from a human donor, that would be a medical first ó and a success.

Andrews is the fourth living patient in the US to get a genetically modified pig kidney transplant, and he wonít be the last. In addition to the ongoing trial at Mass General in conjunction with biotech firm eGenesis, United Therapeutics Corp ñ the other main biotech company helping create the pig kidneys ñ announced in February that it would be allowed to start its own clinical trials with New York University.

In March 2024, Richard Slayman became the first living patient in the world to get a genetically modified pig kidney. The operation at Mass General went well, but he died two months later from causes not related to the transplant.

Doctors said they learned a lot from their experience with Slayman. He had scarring on his heart after eight years of dialysis, Riella said, and itís probably important to get patients like Andrews, who havenít needed dialysis as long.

In April 2024, Lisa Pisano became the first person to receive a mechanical heart pump as well as a gene-edited pig kidney. The organ failed due to limited blood flow and was removed the next month. She died in July 2024.

Then, in November 2024, NYU transplanted 53-year-old Towana Looney with a genetically modified pig kidney. It functioned for four months and nine days, the longest yet, but doctors had to remove it in April when her immune system started to reject it.

Figuring out how to manage rejection is going to be key, doctors say. The pig kidneys Andrews and Slayman got had 69 genomic edits, while Looneyís had fewer. Doctors say they still donít know how many edits are necessary, but both versions of the modified pig kidneys had pig genes removed and human genes added to make the organ more compatible with the human body.

Patients also receive anti-rejection drugs and wearable remote monitoring tools. But doctors still are figuring out how much medicine and monitoring is needed.

ìIt is a learning curve,î Riella said.

Riella is hopeful xenotransplantation may one day solve the worldís organ shortage.

ìI think patients like Tim will be remembered as heroes,î he said. ìWithout them willing to take the risk, we wouldnít be able to move this to the clinic.î

Andrews remembers what it felt like to have to make the choice. But he also remembers what it was like to sit for hours at the dialysis center.

ìItís hard to come to terms with mortality. You think ëah, I can handle thatí and everything, but itís tough,î he said recently, back in the green chair where he underwent dialysis. ìIt was very tough to realize that was it.

ìI was going to die in this building.î

He found a way out. He hopes his story will inspire others to look for hope, too.

ìI see way too many people give up,î Andrews said. ìDonít give up.î

FDA†greenlights†first†blood†test†to†help†diagnose†Alzheimer†disease†in†the†US,"The US Food and Drug Administration has given marketing clearance to a blood test to help diagnose Alzheimerís disease, making the test the first to get signoff to aid in the early detection of the disease in the United States.

The test, called the Lumipulse G pTau217/ﬂ-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio, is for adults 55 and older who are showing signs and symptoms of Alzheimerís disease, the FDA announced Friday.

It works by measuring two proteins in blood plasma: pTau217 and beta-amyloid 1-42. A ratio of those proteins tends to correlate with the occurrence or absence of amyloid plaques in the brain, which are among the hallmarks of Alzheimerís disease. The test does not measure amyloid directly but can signal its presence.

A new potential Alzheimerís test can find symptoms before they begin to show

However, there remains no current single test to diagnose Alzheimerís disease. Doctors primarily rely on a variety of tools to diagnose the condition, which may include medical history, neurological exams, cognitive and functional evaluations, brain imaging, spinal fluid analysis and, more recently, blood tests.


The FDA said the results of the newly cleared blood test must be assessed in conjunction with other clinical information from a patient.

ìAlzheimerís disease impacts too many people, more than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined,î FDA Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary said in Fridayís announcement. ìKnowing that 10% of people aged 65 and older have Alzheimerís, and that by 2050 that number is expected to double, I am hopeful that new medical products such as this one will help patients.î

According to the FDA, the new blood test ñ developed by the Pennsylvania-based biotechnology company Fujirebio Diagnostics Inc. ñ can help increase access to Alzheimerís disease detection and reduce reliance on positron emission tomography or PET scans, a type of imaging that can reveal amyloid plaques in the brain but can be expensive, costing thousands of dollars without insurance.


The FDA said it reviewed clinical trial data on the new blood test, involving plasma samples collected from 499 adults who were cognitively impaired. The samples were evaluated using the blood test, and the results were compared with the results from patientsí PET scans or separate testing using cerebrospinal fluid samples, such as from spinal taps.

The data showed that 91.7% of adults with positive results using the blood test had the presence of amyloid plaques confirmed by their PET scan or cerebrospinal fluid test, and 97.3% of people with negative results had a negative amyloid PET scan or cerebrospinal fluid test result, according to the FDA.

The agency added that the risks associated with the blood test are mainly the risk of a false positive or false negative test result.

A ënew eraí of Alzheimerís research
Preventive neurologist Dr. Richard Isaacson, who established one of the first Alzheimerís prevention clinics in the United States, said he has been using this blood test for years for research and applauded the FDA clearance.


ìIt can provide better clarity into whether a person experiencing memory loss may have Alzheimerís disease. They can take this test as a screening test,î said Isaacson, director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida. Compared with costly PET scans or spinal taps, ìthis is a much more simple screening test, with reasonable accuracy, to tell the physician that a person with cognitive decline has symptoms that are actually due to Alzheimerís disease.î

But Isaacson warned that while the FDA clearance is ìan important step forwardî for the field, more research is needed to help inform how blood test results should be interpreted and used to make clinical decisions.

ìI think the next step as a field is, we need to advance education about what these tests mean and what they donít and who they should be used for,î he said. ìBecause they mean different things in different people depending on their risk factors and whether or not they have symptoms. So weíre still early.î

Fujirebio Diagnostics designed the blood test to help detect Alzheimerís disease early, when interventions are more effective, president and CEO Monte Wiltse said in a news release last year, when the company filed its test with the FDA.


ìAn early and accurate diagnosis will also facilitate the development of new drug therapies, which are urgently needed as the prevalence of AD increases with a rapidly aging population globally,î Wiltse said.

Itís estimated that more than 2 in 5 people over the age of 55 in the United States ñ about 42% ñ will develop dementia in their later years.

But in some cases, deposits of amyloid can start to accumulate in the brain decades before Alzheimerís symptoms begin. Early detection of these amyloid plaques could open the door for a person to take steps to slow the progression of disease, such as starting preventive treatment with medications.

ìFor too long Americans have struggled to get a simple and accurate diagnosis, with todayís action by the FDA we are hopeful it will be easier for more individuals to receive an accurate diagnosis earlier,î Dr. Maria Carrillo, chief science officer and medical affairs lead at the Alzheimerís Association, said in a statement Friday.

ëAmazingí reduction in Alzheimerís risk verified by blood markers, study says

There are a variety of laboratory-developed tests on the market that can be used to detect blood-based biomarkers associated with Alzheimerís, according to the Alzheimerís Association, as well as experimental tests. But the Fujirebio Diagnostics test is the first one cleared by the FDA.


ìBlood-based biomarkers are reshaping how we identify and understand Alzheimerís disease,î Carrillo said. ìAt the same time, there are important questions for health care professionals to consider; in particular, who should be tested and when.î

For now, the FDAís clearance ìmarks a major milestone,î said Dr. Howard Fillit, co-founder and chief science officer at the Alzheimerís Drug Discovery Foundation.

ìThe ability to diagnose Alzheimerís earlier with a simple blood test, like we do for cholesterol, is a game changer, allowing more patients to receive treatment options that have the potential to significantly slow or even prevent the disease,î Fillit said in an email Friday. ìThis is a clear example of the new era of Alzheimerís research where innovation, science and technology come together

"After†NIH†staffing†cuts,†cancer†patient†in†clinical†trial†worries†she†may†lose†crucial†time","With the future of her cancer treatment in limbo, Natalie Phelps doesnít know how much longer she can wait.

Last month, after months of seeking treatment options for her colorectal cancer, the 43-year-old mother of two was accepted into an ongoing study at the National Institutes of Health. She thought the research would allow her to receive an experimental immunotherapy ñ but she now faces an excruciating wait and an equally excruciating choice.

First, her tumor must grow to at least 1 centimeter in size in order to receive treatment, she said. But even after she meets that criteria, an abrupt reduction in the NIH workforce means her treatment will take much longer to develop than initially expected. Sheís worried that that extra time may make a huge difference in her health.

The Trump administration has been conducting a review of funding and a restructuring of the US Department of Health and Human Services, resulting in massive waves of job cuts across federal health agencies under HHS, including the NIH, the nationís medical research agency.

Immunotherapy helps certain cancer patients avoid surgery: ëWe hope this is the futureí

Part of the HHS transformation involves decreasing the NIH workforce by about 1,200 ìby centralizing procurement, human resources, and communications across its 27 institutes and centers,î according to the Trump administration. The administration announced in late March that the HHS restructuring would save taxpayers $1.8 billion per year through an overall reduction of about 10,000 full-time employees.


Phelps said that some of the scientists working on her NIH trial were among the cuts.

Phelps was diagnosed with stage IV colorectal cancer in 2020, at age 38. She was nearly eight months pregnant at the time and originally thought her symptoms ñ abdominal pain, irregular bowel movements and mucus in her stool ñ were probably due to pregnancy or hemorrhoids. But as her symptoms worsened, she had a colonoscopy that found a tumor in her rectum. Further testing confirmed that it was cancer and that it had spread to her liver.

Phelps has had surgery to remove the initial tumor, radiation therapy, three liver surgeries and 48 rounds of chemotherapy. Yet the cancer has continued to spread, she said, which is why she has been eager to try immunotherapy through the NIH trial ñ and is worried about the wait.

Trial delay ëcould cost them their lifeí
Immunotherapy is a form of cancer treatment that harnesses a personís own immune cells to target and fight the disease. The NIH trial specifically involves a T-cell receptor-based therapy in which Phelpsí immune cells were collected through a blood draw, she said. Once her tumor grows to meet the criteria, the cells will be engineered to target her cancer, she said.


But the time it may take to engineer the cells for that next step has expanded from four to eight weeks because there are not as many researchers working on the trial as before the NIH staff cuts, Phelps said.

ìSo hereís the tricky part: Should I continue staying off chemo and hope a tumor grows to meet the 1-centimeter threshold, or give up on clinical trials for now?î Phelps said. Giving up on the trials would mean a return to traditional chemotherapy and radiation to treat her cancer.

She was told that the NIH team will work to engineer her cells at a faster rate than others in the trial so it wonít take eight weeks, but the process will still take weeks.

Overall, ìgoing from four to eight weeks is a huge deal for people with metastatic cancer,î Phelps said, adding that it could lead to further complications or even be life-threatening.


ìJust to give you a personal example, at the end of March, my scan showed I had disease that was stable, and my blood work showed that my tumor antigens were coming down. It was at a number of 43 for something called a CEA,î Phelps said. This carcinoembryonic antigen test measures levels of the CEA protein in the blood, as certain cancers like colorectal may cause high levels.

ìOne month later, my disease had spread to my bones, all of my lymph nodes, and my CEA marker was 203. Thatís in one month, in four weeks,î she said. ìFor some patients, it might not be a huge deal. For other patients, like me, it is, and it could cost them their life.î

The reductions in NIH funding and staff are happening at a time when colorectal cancer cases have been rising among younger adults. A report released in 2023 by the American Cancer Society said that the proportion of colorectal cancer cases among adults younger than 55 increased from 11% in 1995 to 20% in 2019.

ìThe rates of cancer amongst people younger than 50 are on the rise, and they tend to be aggressive and later-stage cancers,î Phelps said. ìSo it makes zero sense, if you care about keeping America healthy, to reduce your medical research at a time when you have cancer rates rising in your younger population that are the ones working and driving the economy.î


Phelps added that if she could wave a magic wand, she would wish for ìall the cancer research to be restored to where it was before this administration started.î

ëYou donít care about Natalieí
US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was asked at a Senate committee hearing Wednesday about NIH staff cuts and Phelpsí case specifically.

Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, said during the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing that Phelpsí ìbest hopeî is the NIH clinical trial.


Kennedy said that if Murray contacts his office, he can help.

ìI donít think that should happen to anybody,î Kennedy said of Phelpsí case.

ìWell, what have you ñ and I mean you personally ñ done to assess how those staff cuts are impacting patient care? She is one of many,î Murray asked.

ìI provided the guidelines that said no clinical trials should be affected by the cuts,î Kennedy responded.


ìMr. Secretary, I just have a short amount of time ñ they are impacting clinical trials,î Murray interrupted.

ìYou asked me the question. Do you want me to answer it?î Kennedy retorted.

Lawmakers press Kennedy on mass cuts ahead of future budget

Their heated exchange continued.


ìI offered to help her, but you donít care. You donít care about Natalie,î Kennedy said. ìIíve offered to help Natalie.î

Murray then pressed him about proposed cuts at the NIH.

ìI think the cuts that are now proposed by NIH are going to hurt,î Kennedy said. ìThereís no agency head in the government, like myself, that wants to see their budget cut.î

Murray asked for a personal update on Phelpsí case from Kennedyís office in the next 24 hours, as well as details about the state of NIH clinical care.


Later in the hearing, Kennedy said that his team had identified Phelpsí case and that she has not met the criteria to receive treatment in the trial.

ìIt had nothing to doî with the reduction in force at the NIH, he said. ìNone of our clinical trials were shut down because of the RIF. That was a canard.î

Murray later responded that she spoke with Phelps directly and that it was her doctor at the NIH who told Phelps that staffing cuts were having an impact.

ìThe issue, as I stated clearly, was the delay in care,î Murray said. ìMy staff has put in inquiries with HHS leadership, and theyíve been unresponsive so far. And just to make it clear, this is just one case of many.î

Federal health overhaul
HHS ìremains committedî to advancing cancer research, spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in an email.


ìHHS deeply values cancer research and remains committed to advancing life-saving scientific studies that improve patient care and outcomes to Make America Healthy Again,î he said.

When plans for the restructuring of HHS were announced in late March, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. described them as an effort to allow the department to do more at a lower cost to taxpayers.

ìThis overhaul will be a win-win for taxpayers and for those that HHS serves,î he said.

Trump administration cut $2.7 billion in NIH research funding through March, Senate committee minority report says

A new Senate HELP Committee minority staff report, released Tuesday and authored by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, found that the Trump administration cut $2.7 billion in NIH research funding in the first three months of this year ñ including a 31% reduction in cancer research funding from January through March compared with the same timeframe last year.


In a post on X in response, HHS called Sandersí report ìunequivocally falseî and ìa politically motivated distortion that undermines the thousands of dedicated public health professionals across HHS, who remain steadfast in their commitment to delivering results for the American people.î The post added that HHS is ìstreamlining programs, eliminating redundancies, and ñ above all else ñ prioritizing gold standard science.î

Itís estimated that at least 1 in 5 people with cancer in the US participate in some form of medical research.

ìClinical trials are a key part of delivery of care to patients. At a large academic center, such as all the large cancer centers, clinical trials are deeply ingrained into patient care ñ and without clinical trials, advances in delivery of care to patients will not be made. Itís only through clinical trials that high-quality data about new treatments and cures can be developed,î said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, who has been following the changes at the NIH.

ìI can also say that terminating multiyear research projects midway leads to a lot of waste of taxpayersí dollars, because there has already been substantial investment in a project,î he said. ìSo if you end a study when itís halfway done or three-quarters of the way done, then thereís no benefit to either science or to patients after there has already been substantial investment.î","May

Florida†becomes†second†state†in†US†to†ban†fluoride†in†public†drinking†water,"Florida has become the second state in the nation to ban the addition of fluoride to public drinking water.

On Thursday, Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the Florida Farm Bill, which includes language banning the use of any additive in a public water system that does not meet the new definition of a ìwater quality additiveî: a chemical or substance used in public water to specifically address drinking water standards, contaminants or quality.

ìYes, use fluoride for your teeth, thatís fine. But forcing it into the water supply is basically forced medication on people,î DeSantis said. ìThey donít have a choice. Youíre taking that away from them.î

More than 70% of Floridians who use community water systems receive fluoridated water, according to Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, who issued guidance in November recommending against community water fluoridation, citing its potential health effects.

What to know about fluoride in drinking water

Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral thatís found in soil, rocks and water to varying degrees. It is also a byproduct of fertilizer production. On the recommendation of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, many cities have added fluoride to their treated drinking water for decades to help protect teeth from cavities.


The CDC reiterated its faith in the health benefits of fluoride in 2015, naming water fluoridation one of the ì10 Greatest Public Health Achievements of the 21st Century.î The ADA has also emphasized that ìeighty years of community water fluoridation at optimal levels has proven to be safe and effective at reducing tooth decay to improve oral health.î

However, research has showed that exposure to fluoridated water during pregnancy is associated with increased neurobehavioral problems in children, and a federal review concluded that higher levels are linked with lower IQ in kids.

Utahís ban on fluoride in public water is a simple change that raises complicated new health risks, experts say


US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pledged to roll back CDC recommendations that fluoride be added to municipal drinking water and has promised that a panel of experts will review the guidelines and make new recommendations.


Kennedy canít formally prevent communities from adding fluoride to their drinking water, but some states and cities have followed his lead. In March, Utah became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water.

The US Food and Drug Administration also said this week it is starting the process to remove prescription fluoride tablets and drops from the market. Theyíre typically prescribed for babies and children who are at high risk of tooth decay because they drink water that doesnít contain added fluoride.","May 16,2025",Health,Katherine†Dillinger,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/15/health/florida-fluoride-ban,,,,,,,,,,,,florida become second state nation ban addition fluoride public drinking water thursday gov ron desantis signed florida farm bill includes language banning use additive public water system meet new definition ‚Äúwater quality additive‚Äù chemical substance used public water specifically address drinking water standards contaminants quality ‚Äúyes use fluoride teeth that‚Äôs fine forcing water supply basically forced medication people‚Äù desantis said ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt choice you‚Äôre taking away them‚Äù floridians use community water systems receive fluoridated water according florida surgeon general dr joseph ladapo issued guidance november recommending community water fluoridation citing potential health effects related article datafluoridefinaljpg know fluoride drinking water fluoride naturally occurring mineral that‚Äôs found soil rocks water varying degrees also byproduct fertilizer production recommendation us centers disease control prevention world health organization many cities added fluoride treated drinking water decades help protect teeth cavities cdc reiterated faith health benefits fluoride naming water fluoridation one ‚Äú greatest public health achievements st century‚Äù ada also emphasized ‚Äúeighty years community water fluoridation optimal levels proven safe effective reducing tooth decay improve oral health‚Äù however research showed exposure fluoridated water pregnancy associated increased neurobehavioral problems children federal review concluded higher levels linked lower iq kids related article dissected human teeth displayed office dentist dr james bekker april salt lake city utah ap photohannah schoenbaum utah‚Äôs ban fluoride public water simple change raises complicated new health risks experts say us health human services secretary robert f kennedy jr pledged roll back cdc recommendations fluoride added municipal drinking water promised panel experts review guidelines make new recommendations kennedy can‚Äôt formally prevent communities adding fluoride drinking water states cities followed lead march utah became first state ban fluoride public drinking water us food drug administration also said week starting process remove prescription fluoride tablets drops market they‚Äôre typically prescribed babies children high risk tooth decay drink water doesn‚Äôt contain added fluoride

ìMarket research and US C.D.C. statistics indicate that older individuals and those with underlying conditions are the populations most likely to seek out COVID-19 vaccination seasonally,î Novavax President and CEO John Jacobs said in a statement Saturday. ìThis significant milestone demonstrates our commitment to these populations and is a significant step towards availability of our protein-based vaccine option.î

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists a wide range of conditions that may make someone more likely to become severely ill with Covid-19, including older age, asthma, diabetes, lung disease, obesity and pregnancy.

The Novavax Covid-19 vaccine, which uses more traditional protein-based technology than the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, has been subject to emergency use authorization since 2022. Pfizer and Modernaís vaccines have been FDA-approved for people 12 and up and remain available under emergency use authorization for children as young as 6 months.


Novavaxís vaccine had been on track for full approval April 1, but the FDA delayed the decision while it sought more data, a source told CNN. The new approval letter issued Friday requires Novavax to conduct postmarketing studies looking at the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis ñ inflammation of the heart muscle and of the membrane surrounding the heart ñ in people who receive the vaccine.

These conditions have rarely been reported after Covid-19 vaccination, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A handful of cases were reported in trials of the Novavax vaccine, suggesting an increased risk, the CDC notes. However, the CDC and its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices have said the benefits of Covid-19 vaccination outweigh the rare risk of heart inflammation in all groups recommended for vaccination.

The CDCís vaccine advisers are considering changes to the agencyís guidance for who should get an annual Covid-19 shot. At last monthís meeting of, the committee discussed a recommendation focused on older adults, those with weakened immune systems and possibly those who are more likely to be exposed to the coronavirus.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services and a longtime anti-vaccine activist, has falsely called vaccines for Covid-19 ìthe deadliest vaccine ever madeî and more recently made misleading statements about the safety of the measles vaccine amid a massive outbreak centered in West Texas.

"SkinnyTok,†the†latest†weight-loss†trend,†is†more†dangerous†than†you†think","While the internetís darkest corners have always harbored harmful ideas, a new TikTok trend takes hazardous pro-eating disorder content out of the shadows and into the view of millions of people.

SkinnyTok, the viral weight-loss hashtag on TikTok, goes beyond typical fitness and nutrition advice and instead recommends dangerous levels of restriction with a side of verbal abuse.

Those in hard-fought recovery from anorexia have raised concerns that this craze poses a serious health risk, particularly for young women, who are the main target of these weight-loss messages.

Often referred to as ìthinspoî or ìpro-ana,î online content encouraging eating disorder behaviors is nothing new, but TikTokís video format and algorithm now spread this type of content far and wide rather than it staying confined to a smaller community of users .

TikTok declined to respond to my questions directly, but a spokesperson shared some of the steps they say the company takes, such as interrupting repetitive content and directing users to mental health resources, including organizations that specialize in eating disorder recovery. Those users who want to limit weight-loss content can filter out particular words and hashtags.


Despite TikTokís policy that explicitly prohibits ìshowing or promoting disordered eating and dangerous weight loss behaviors,î I still find that these shocking videos continue to proliferate on the platform.

Prior pro-eating disorder content on sites like Tumblr or X ìwere more niche in the sense that they were more directed toward people who had eating disorders,î said Mallary Tenore Tarpley, an assistant professor of practice at the University of Texas at Austin, whose first book, ìSlip: Life in the Middle of Eating Disorder Recovery,î will be released in August.

Rather than something an already struggling person might seek out to reinforce their mental illness, SkinnyTok is out in the open and even presented as healthy.


Tarpley worries the average viewer is unlikely to recognize how extreme and dangerous these messages are. ìBecause they are framed as just this sort of wellness movement or healthy eating, they become more mainstream, and therefore people donít necessarily see the toxicity in them,î she said.

When Los Angeles-based licensed clinical social worker Shira Rosenbluth first came across this kind of content, she was surprised at the resurgence of these dangerous messages.

ìWeíre still doing this twentysomething years later?î Rosenbluth asked. ìWeíre still in exactly the same place where weíre glorifying not just fitness, weíre glorifying eating disorders and disordered eating? You see them say itís not about being skinny, itís just about being healthy. And itís like, OK, but why is it called SkinnyTok?î

Some of the viral content is so outrageous, Rosenbluth even wondered if itís simply ìrage-bait,î an attempt to get reactions and attention simply by being so offensive. Even if influencers are posting this shocking content primarily to drive engagement, the primary audience ó teen girls and young women ó are still being put in harmís way.

Jokes about starving yourself arenít funny
While some defenders of this content argue itís not meant to be taken seriously, Tarpley finds the trending motifs often describe specific anorexia symptoms. ìSometimes the advice given may seem like itís supposed to be humorous, but in fact a lot of people struggling with eating disorders actually engage in those very same behaviors, and it is far from funny.î


She shared how one popular SkinnyTok trend was eerily similar to something she experienced while in the throes of anorexia as a child. ìI saw one video where someone said, ëIf youíre sleeping and wake in the middle of the night hungry, just chew on your pillow,íî she said. ìI remember doing something similar when I was younger.î

The kinds of weight-loss tips popular on the platform ìcould become a guidebook for people with eating disorders or for people who are flirting with dieting and are predisposed to developing an eating disorder,î Tarpley added. ìIt becomes this very slippery slope where you hear these ideas that are expressed in jest, or you hear the shaming and then you begin to really believe that itís true.î

Influencers sound like an abusive ëeating disorder voiceí
Demeaning messages about peopleís eating and bodies are popular on SkinnyTok, and Rosenbluth understands why people might be attracted to such negativity.


ìItís almost like an abuse victim who thinks thatís what they deserve,î said Rosenbluth, who is in recovery from anorexia. ìIím especially thinking about like a larger teenager who has been taught that their body is bad and their body is wrong, and that they need to do everything they can to change their body. They think they deserve to be talked to like that.î

Speaking from her clientsí experiences and her own, Rosenbluth recognized the way these influencersí cruel messages often directly echo the internal torment of people with eating disorders.

ìThe bully voice sounds similar to the eating disorder voice,î she said. ìSomeone in any size body with an eating disorder is talking to themselves like that internally. People describe it as this monster thatís in their head, kind of screaming at them all the time.î

While Rosenbluth noted that she and her patients used to feel that ìnobody could be meaner than this monster, (itís possible that) the TikTok bullies are equal. This constant voice, telling them that they are nothing, that theyíre garbage, that theyíre not worthy, that they shouldnít be seen, that they shouldnít be heard, that they need to be thin.î


Rosenbluth finds one of the popular taglines ó ìYou donít need a treat. Youíre not a dogî ó particularly disturbing because of its implication that satisfying basic hunger and need for pleasure makes you less than human. ìItís scary that weíre saying the human right of eating and enjoying food is something that is so wildly wrong when itís actually human, a part of life,î she said.

These dehumanizing messages are a recipe for stress and suffering, but theyíre sold to viewers as ìtough loveî or even self-care. Particularly for impressionable young people, these influencers promote ìthis belief that we need to be thin in order to be beautiful and accepted and loved,î added Tarpley.

Donít underestimate the health risks
People swept up in following these ìthinfluencersî arenít usually aware of the serious risks that come with adopting their rigid dietary advice.


ìWhatís really scary to me is that teenagers and young adults, if they start restricting, they can do permanent damage. Weíre talking about permanent bone loss and osteoporosis later on in life,î Rosenbluth said. ìRestriction can impact the entire body.î

The conflation of thinness with health can make it hard for parents to notice if their teen is absorbing this dangerous content. Rosenbluth worries especially about adolescents and knows they need support to set limits on how much time they spend on social media. ìPeople can get sucked in for hours on end, and no teenager needs that.î

The sheer volume of exposure to this harmful content concerns Tarpley, too. ìThe algorithms are designed in such a way that if you begin to kind of flirt with some of this content, youíre going to start seeing it more and more in your feed,î she said. ìIt becomes very hard then to escape that. And that can lead people down these rabbit holes that can be really dark and really hard to get out of.î


Parents who observe their child restricting food or exercising excessively shouldnít dismiss the behaviors as just a fad diet or an attempt to ìbe healthyî and get in shape.

ìThereís this tendency to think that eating disorders are just some sort of passing phase or something that can be quickly overcome, and I will say, eating disorders can ruin lives. They can take lives,î Tarpley warned.

Most parents donít know that trouble can start after exposure to content far less extreme than whatís on SkinnyTok. Throughout her career, Rosenbluth has worked with countless people ìwho started out on these innocent diets or just wanting to lose a few pounds, and now theyíre completely consumed.î

Itís easy for an eating disorder to start but incredibly hard to end it. ìThat period of developing an eating disorder can be quite quick, but it can take years, and in some cases a lifetime, for people to actually recover,î Tarpley noted.


Tarpley wishes adults and teens understood the serious risks of engaging with this kind of content: ìPeople think, well, itís just social media. Thereís no way I could develop an eating disorder just because of some videos I see. But in talking with lots of people with all different types of eating disorders, I recognize thatís very much something that could happen. So, I think the more we can talk about this reality, the better.î

What†are†your†questions†about†fluoride?,"Fluoride can help prevent tooth decay by strengthening the protective outer layer of enamel thatís worn away by acids formed by bacteria, plaque and sugars in the mouth. Since 1945, it has been added to many US water systems and is also available in toothpaste and other supplements. Recently, some states have banned it from water due to questions about safety, cost and personal choice.

Popular†injected†weight†loss†medications†work†better†for†one†sex.†Researchers†want†to†know†why,"Youíve probably heard the stories: For every man who has cut carbs from his diet and dropped 10 pounds, thereís a woman whoís done exactly the same thing and lost 2. Research backs up this frustrating fact. Diet and exercise tend to benefit men much more than women when it comes to losing weight.

Thatís why the results of recent clinical trials were surprising ó and welcome ó for some: In study after study, injected GLP-1 weight loss medications appear to work better on average for women than they do for men.

Whatís not clear is why. And researchers say itís important to understand so doctors can optimize the use of these powerful drugs for everyone.

The latest study to see this effect was presented Sunday at the annual meeting of the European Congress on Obesity and published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

It was the first head-to-head comparison of the injectable GLP-1 medications semaglutide and tirzepatide, which are sold under the brand names Wegovy and Zepbound for weight loss. Roughly 750 people with obesity were randomly split into two groups. Half were assigned to get the maximum dose of Wegovy they could tolerate; the other half used the maximum dose of Zepbound.


Zepbound is newer medication than Wegovy. It stimulates two different gut hormones that affect appetite and blood sugar, while Wegovy primarily affects the action of one.

Many doctors have observed that Zepbound seems to be a more powerful medication than Wegovy, so it was not surprising when this trial ñ which was sponsored by Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of Zepbound ñ arrived at the same conclusion. People in the study who were using Zepbound lost about 50% more weight those who got Wegovy, making it the superior drug in terms of weight loss.

One curious thing about the study was that all the participants lost a little bit less weight, on average, than has been measured with the same medications in other trials.


Researchers say that result was driven by men, who lost about 6% less weight than women. About 35% of participants in this study were men, while 20% to 25% of participants in previous trials have been male.

ìWhy this works better in women, I canít honestly tell you, but itís great,î said Dr. Louis Aronne, who directs the Comprehensive Weight Control Center at Weill Cornell Medicine and who led the study. ìIt has been seen again and again.î

For example, in long-term follow up of a trial that compared semaglutide to a placebo, women using semaglutide for two years lost an average of 11% of their starting weight, while men using the drug lost an average of 8%. Across trials of tirzepatide that compared it to a placebo, women on the drug lost up to 28% of their starting weight, while men lost up to 19% of their weight.

Untangling sex-specific effects
There could be a host of reasons for this, spanning numerous aspects of biology and culture, said Dr. Melanie Jay, an obesity expert and professor of medicine at New York Universityís Grossman School of Medicine.


The first has to do with drug dosing. Women tend to weigh a little bit less than men but are prescribed the same doses, so it may be that theyíre getting more for their size. ìSo maybe theyíre getting a higher dose,î Jay said.

It might also have something to do with where women store fat. Jay said women tend to have more cutaneous fat, or fat under their skin, than visceral fat, or fat thatís packed around the internal organs like the liver. Perhaps the drugs are more effective on one type of fat than the other.

Women also face more societal pressure to be thin, Jay said, and this could lead to greater motivation to stay on the medications, which arenít always easy to take.

Jay said sheís seen this in her own practice. Women seem to be more willing to tolerate and work through the significant side effects of the drugs, which can include regular nausea, vomiting and constipation.


ìI have had a few more men be like, ëI canít take the constipation or the nausea,í whereas the women usually figure out how to get through it,î Jay said.

She said the side effects tend to get better over time, as people learn how to eat differently and start to exercise more.

Role of estrogen in weight loss
One of the most intriguing clues to explain why women benefit more from the GLP-1 medications has to do with the hormone estrogen, which women have in higher amounts than men.


Dr. Karolina Skibicka is a professor of molecular medicine at the University of Gothenberg in Sweden and has a lab in the nutrition department at Penn State University. ìOverall, Iím a neuroscientist interested in gut-brain communication,î which is how she began studying GLP-1, a gut hormone that also works in the brain.

Skibicka says scientists have known that estrogen plays a role in metabolism for about 30 years, but they didnít really understand how. Her research in rats has shown that estrogen directly interacts with GLP-1 and other gut hormones, making them more potent in the brain.

Several studies have shown that if you inject rats with GLP-1 and estrogen together, ìyou will see a very enhanced effect sort of across the board, on feeding behavior, motivated behavior, various other aspects of GLP-1 actions,î she said.

You can test this interaction in a another way, she said. If you block the action of estrogen with a chemical inhibitor, it turns down the effect of GLP-1, too.


ìIf we take it away, the effect is reduced, so the animals will eat a little bit more now, or GLP-1 is just not as effective as suppressing feeding or suppressing food reward behavior, maybe more specifically, when we take away estrogen,î she said.

Estrogen appears to amplify the effects of GLP-1 by increasing the number of receptors ó think of them as boat docks ó on the surface of cells where this gut hormone can attach. In many tissues, she says, cells have receptors for both estrogen and GLP-1. ìSo then you sort of have an amplified effect inside the cell as well.î

Although all of these theories are interesting, they are just educated guesses at this point.

A push for more research
ìWeíre really dealing with paucity of data compared to just sort of the baseline data that you have about what GLP-1 does,î Skibicka said. ìClinical studies donít really ask and donít really confirm why they see a difference.î


Both Jay and Skibicka said sex differences typically go unexplored when it comes to drugs, and the GLP-1 medications are no exception.

In studies that do report data by sex, women may lose 50% to 90% more weight than men, but they also seem to report more GI side effects, Skibicka said. Men seem to get more cardiovascular benefits from the medications than women.

Popular GLP-1 medications may have health benefits that extend beyond weight loss and blood sugar control, a new study finds

Although most studies donít find that GLP-1 medications negatively affect mood, some have shown that this may differ by sex, with women being more likely to experience depression on the medications than men.


Understanding the impacts of these sex differences could be important for all patients.

If estrogen affects how strongly the medications work, that may have implications for the treatment of women before or after menopause, since estrogen levels fall in women as they age. It may also impact how well GLP-1 medications work for women on hormone-blocking therapies after breast cancer, for example. It may lead to strategies that help nonresponders, the people who donít seem to lose weight on the drugs, and people who stop losing weight before they reach their weight loss goals.

Jay said that understanding the mechanisms behind the sex differences could help with adherence to the medications, too.

ìI think those things are really important to know, because maybe thereís something else that we could give men alongside it that could enhance it Ö or we could change the dosing,î Jay said. ìMen and

There†is†a†hepatitis†A†outbreak†in†LA†County.†Why†you†need†to†know,"Los Angeles County is facing a community-wide outbreak of the contagious virus hepatitis A, citing a sustained increase in clinical cases and elevated virus levels detected in wastewater testing.

The county reported on May 5 that there have been 29 confirmed cases of hepatitis A this year. That number is out of a total 165 documented cases since the start of 2024, which is three times the total number of cases reported in 2023. At least seven people have died during this outbreak, according to local media.

What is hepatitis A? What symptoms does it cause? How is it diagnosed and treated? Who are the individuals most vulnerable to severe outcomes? Who should be vaccinated against the disease? And what other steps can people take to reduce their chance of contracting it?

To guide us through these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. She is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. Wen previously served as Baltimoreís health commissioner.

CNN: What is hepatitis A?


Dr. Leana Wen: Hepatitis A is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis A virus, which is highly contagious. Most people who develop the disease will recover completely, without lasting liver damage. However, some people can become very sick ó they can develop liver failure, require intensive care and die.

CNN: How is hepatitis A transmitted?

Wen: The hepatitis A virus is transmitted primarily through the fecal-oral route, meaning that someone gets it by ingesting food or water that has been contaminated with the virus from an infected person.

This type of transmission could occur with individuals living in close quarters ó for instance, when an infected person prepares food for family members or when someone is caring for an infected person and doesnít wash their hands fully before eating. Waterborne outbreaks also can happen when there is sewage contamination. Another pathway for virus transmission is through sexual contact, such as oral-anal intercourse.

CNN: What symptoms does it cause?


Wen: Symptoms of hepatitis A can include fatigue, fever, joint pain, nausea, diarrhea, dark urine or clay-colored stools and jaundice, which is yellowing of the skin or eyes. The symptoms typically resolve within two months, though some people can feel ill for as long as six months.

Itís important to note that some people with hepatitis A could be asymptomatic, which means that they could be infected without having any symptoms and pass the virus unknowingly to others. The possibility of asymptomatic transmission, along with the very long incubation period for hepatitis ó people are infected for usually 14 to 28 days before they show symptoms ó make controlling outbreaks challenging.

CNN: How is hepatitis A diagnosed and treated?

Wen: The diagnosis requires a blood test, which looks for the presence of a particular antibody (hepatitis A virus IGM antibody) that identifies acute infection with the hepatitis A virus. This blood test is positive two weeks before the onset of symptoms and lasts about six months after.


There is no specific treatment, antiviral or otherwise, for hepatitis A. The therapies are all supportive in nature, which means doctors will try to ease your symptoms. Individuals who are dehydrated may receive intravenous hydration. People experiencing fatigue are told to rest. The majority of cases are mild and people recovery fully. Severe cases may require hospitalization. If someone experiences the rare complication of liver failure, they may require a liver transplant.

CNN: Which people are more likely to have severe illness?

Wen: The people most likely to experience severe outcomes include older individuals and those with significant underlying medical conditions, such as chronic liver disease and immunocompromise.

CNN: Who is most likely to contract hepatitis A?


Wen: A key risk factor is visiting parts of the world where hepatitis A is common, such as Central and South Africa, eastern Europe and parts of Asia. People who may be at higher risk include those experiencing homelessness, men who have sex with men and people who use illegal drugs.

In Los Angeles County, officials have said that most of the recent cases involve individuals who do not have these specific risk factors. They donít know what exactly is driving the outbreak; investigations are underway.

CNN: Is there a hepatitis A vaccine? Who should be vaccinated?

Wen: There are two types of hepatitis A vaccines available. One of them is a two-dose vaccine against hepatitis A. The other is a three-dose vaccine that protects against both hepatitis A and hepatitis B. The combination vaccine is only available for people 18 and older.


The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the two-dose hepatitis A vaccine to all children ages 12 months to 23 months. The two shots are typically administered over the course of six months. The CDC recommends that children who did not receive the vaccine before 23 months still receive the two doses. No additional booster doses are recommended after initial vaccination series is completed.

Adults at increased risk of contracting hepatitis A virus as well as those at increased risk for severe disease if they were to contract the virus are also recommended to receive the vaccine. Vaccination is also recommended to people who are unvaccinated and who have been exposed to the hepatitis A virus in the preceding two weeks.

In outbreak settings, such as in Los Angeles County, unvaccinated people at higher risk for contracting the virus or for developing severe disease are recommended to receive the vaccine.

CNN: I donít live in Los Angeles. Should I still get vaccinated?


Wen: Everyone should follow the CDCís guidance on hepatitis A vaccinations. All children should be vaccinated as part of their routine childhood immunizations. Adults who are either at increased risk of contracting hepatitis A or at increased risk of severe disease from it should get the vaccine.

CNN: What are the side effects of the vaccine?

Wen: The hepatitis A vaccine is a safe and effective vaccine. Side effects include pain and tenderness at the site of the injection, low-grade fever, loss of appetite and nausea. They are generally mild and go away in the first two days following vaccination.

CNN: What other steps can people take to reduce their chance of contracting hepatitis A?


Wen: The best way to prevent infection is through vaccination. Individuals living in outbreak areas and others who are at high risk who have not been vaccinated should be sure to do so. Good hand hygiene can also reduce the spread of hepatitis A.

What†to†know†about†fluoride†in†drinking†water,"CNN
 ó 
US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. praised Utahís ban on fluoride when he announced he would tell the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending fluoridation for drinking water in April. Florida has now become the second state to ban the use of fluoride in public water systems.

Although the CDC offers recommendations, the US Environmental Protection Agency formally sets limits on what is allowed under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The EPA also announced that it plans to ìexpeditiouslyî review research on the health effects of fluoride to inform possible changes to drinking water regulations, in collaboration with Kennedy and HHS.

Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral present in trace amounts in soil, plants, water and food, and at optimal levels helps prevent cavities by keeping teeth strong. Countries take a range of approaches to ensure that fluoride is provided to children: Some countries add fluoride to water, like the United States, and others add fluoride to milk or salt to keep it at recommended levels. Other countries opt for school-provided fluoride varnishes and mouthwashes.

Fluoridation in the US
Community fluoridation of water was introduced in the United States in 1945 to help improve oral health in a cost-effective and equitable way. The CDC named fluoridation of drinking water one of the 10 greatest health interventions in America in the 20th century alongside vaccination, family planning and safer workplaces.

According to CDC figures, as of 2022, 72% of the US population with community water systems receives fluoridated drinking water. This varies among states, ranging from 8.5% of the population in Hawaii to 100% of the population in Washington, D.C.


Water fluoridation is not mandatory, and although there is a recommended fluoride concentration in drinking water (0.7 milligrams per liter) from the CDC, that is not an enforceable standard. The decision to fluoridate the water is taken at a local level and depends on how much fluoride is naturally present.

There are 36,767 water systems in 36 states with publicly available information on the CDCës website, a small slice of the estimated number of drinking water systems in the US. As of 2023, just over a third (37%) of those water systems included in the data are fluoridated.

It varies depending on state, too. In Kentucky, 93.8% of these reported water systems are fluoridated, and at the bottom end, only 3.7% of water systems reported in Alaska are fluoridated.

There is also a huge range in the levels of fluoride that are found in these water systems. Not all of the 36 states that report fluoride access report fluoride concentration levels, limiting opportunities for thorough analysis. Among them, 24 states report the fluoride levels in 1,774 public water systems.

About 53% of these water systems have fluoride concentration within recommended levels: between 0.7 mg per liter and 1.2 mg per liter. Just under half of them (47%) have fluoride concentration under the CDCís recommended level.


From the publicly available data on water system fluoride levels, two water systems, both located in South Carolina, reported fluoride concentration levels above World Health Organization guidelines. WHO states that long-term exposure to fluoride levels above 1.5 milligrams per liter (mg/L) in drinking water can lead to health problems.

Does water fluoridation help? Evidence is mixed
Itís long been known that fluoride helps to strengthen teeth and bones; thatís why it has been added to food and tap water for many decades. The CDC holds community fluoridation responsible for a 25% reduction in cavities in children. Cavities can cause pain and sensitivity, which can affect speaking and eating. They can also lead to tooth loss or infection that can spread to the body, causing serious illness or death.

But at certain concentration levels, fluoride can cause harm. WHO says that while fluoride reduces the incidence of dental caries (cavities), it does have negative effects at higher levels, such as ìcausing tooth enamel and skeletal fluorosis following prolonged exposure to high concentrations.î Skeletal fluorosis is a serious condition that causes bone weakness and stiffness and pain in joints.

Numerous studies have shown that fluoridated water can help prevent tooth decay and improve oral health. A 2010 Nevada study found that living in a community with fluoridated drinking water was associated with lower incidences of decayed, missing or filled teeth. In 2011, the Canadian city of Calgary removed fluoride from its water due to skepticism about the benefits of fluoride and to cut costs. A later study comparing children in the city with those in Edmonton, where water remained fluoridated, found that over three years, children in Calgary had more tooth decay in their baby teeth. This suggests fluoridated water, without other interventions, was an important source of fluoride for that community.

Yet other studies have found that improvements in oral hygiene awareness and dental practices more generally have lessened the benefits of fluoridated water. A recent report concluded that water fluoridation does help prevent cavities, but not as much as originally thought; the authors posit that recent improvements in cavity prevention are due to the popularity of fluoride in toothpaste and mouthwash.

International data also supports this. Around the world, tooth decay has decreased since the 1970s, even in countries where fluoride is not added to water.


Some of the countries where water is not fluoridated take a different approach to oral health, choosing other fluoride-based interventions.

In the UK, for example, Manchester and Blackpool have programs to provide fluoridated milk to local schoolchildren. In the rest of the country, an estimated 10% of the population has access to fluoridated water, either naturally or through local fluoride programs.

In Iceland, water is not fluoridated, but there are fluoride rinse programs at schools across the country. Children attending school have twice-monthly fluoride rinses.

Japan began a similar school-based fluoride mouth-rinse program in 1970, which has since expanded to nurseries around the country. Research has found that these fluoride mouth-rinse programs are more effective in decreasing cavities when initiated at younger ages.

In Italy, the Society of Paediatric Dentistry recommends a series of interventions for children such as brushing teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste and reducing sugary food and drinks. High-risk individuals are recommended fluoride tablets, varnishes, gels or sealants depending on their age.

However, exposure to too much fluoride can lead to adverse effects. A study published in May 2024 found that higher exposure to fluoride during pregnancy was associated with increased neurobehavioral problems. And an August, federal review of existing research found that higher estimated fluoride exposure (exceeding WHO guidelines of 1.5mg/L) was associated with lower IQ in children. These levels are rarely seen in the US.

Fluoridation of water is ìconsidered to be particularly beneficial for deprived communities and families who are unable or culturally unwilling to access dental hygiene and dental services,ì water researcher John Fawell, a visiting professor at Cranfield University, told CNN in an email.

Fawell, who has advised the World Health Organization on water quality standards, added: ìFluoride at lower concentrations than [those that] cause dental fluorosis have been associated with a small reduction in IQ in children in some epidemiological studies.

ìHowever in the absence of a clear mechanism it remains an association which is not necessarily causal.î

Correction: A previous version of this report misstated the number of people who get fluoridated drinking water.

 ó 
President Donald Trumpís new pick for surgeon general wrote in a recent book that people should consider using unproven psychedelic drugs as therapy and in a newsletter suggested her use of mushrooms helped her find a romantic partner.

Dr. Casey Meansí recommendation to consider guided psilocybin-assisted therapy is notable because psilocybin is illegal under federal law. Itís listed as a Schedule 1 drug, defined as a substance ìwith no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.î Oregon and Colorado have legalized psychedelic therapy, though several cities in Oregon have since banned it.

The surgeon generalís job is to provide Americans with the best scientific information available on how to improve their health and reduce their risk of illness and injury. Past surgeons general have used their position to educate Americans about health problems like AIDS and suicide prevention. The surgeon generalís warning in 1964 about the dangers of smoking helped change the course of Americaís health.

Some, like Dr. C. Everett Koop, surgeon general under President Ronald Reagan, became widely known with substantial impact on policy, and others slipped easily from memory.

White House withdraws another key nomination with last-minute pivot for US surgeon general

Meansí nomination follows a pattern from Trump to select people known for their public personas more than their policy positions. In the case of Means, the Republican president said he chose her solely on the recommendation of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ìBobby thought she was fantastic,î Trump said, adding that he did not know her.


Means, who received her undergraduate and medical degrees from Stanford University, began a medical residency in Oregon but did not complete it. Her medical license is listed as inactive. Contacted by phone, Means declined to comment on the record.

She made the recommendation about psychedelics in her 2024 book, ìGood Energy,î which she wrote with her brother, Calley Means, an entrepreneur who now works in the Trump administration as a health adviser and who has said he invested in biopharmaceutical companies that specialize in psychedelics.

Much of the book focuses on metabolic health, what Casey Means calls ìgood energy.î She suggests a number of strategies to help people ìmanage and heal the stressors, traumas, and thought patterns that limit us and contribute to our poor metabolic health and thriving.î

One such strategy is to ìconsider psilocybin-assisted therapy,î referring to the compound found in psychedelic mushrooms. She details her thinking on the subject in a 750-word passage.


ìIf you feel called, I also encourage you to explore intentional, guided psilocybin therapy,î she wrote. ìStrong scientific evidence suggests that this psychedelic therapy can be one of the most meaningful experiences of life for some people, as they have been for me.î

Though there have been some studies suggesting benefits from psychedelics, it has not been shown that benefits outweigh the risks. Psilocybin can cause hours of hallucinations that can be pleasant or terrifying. When paired with talk therapy, it has been studied as a treatment for psychiatric conditions and alcoholism, but very little research has been done in healthy people. Side effects can include increased heart rate, nausea and headaches. Taking it unsupervised can be dangerous. Hallucinations could cause a user to walk into traffic or take other risks.

FAIRFIELD COUNTY, CONNECTICUT - JULY 28: Psilocybin mushrooms stand ready for harvest in a humidified ""fruiting chamber"" in the basement of a private home on July 28, 2023 in Fairfield County, Connecticut. Recent studies have suggested that psilocybin mushrooms, also known as ""magic mushrooms"" have shown promise in combating anxiety, anorexia, depression, PTSD, obsessive-compulsive disorder and various forms of substance abuse. Scientists say psilocybin may promote neuroplasticity, a rewiring of the brain that gives patients fresh perspectives on longstanding psychiatric problems. Although psilocybin is classified in the U.S. as a Schedule 1 substance, making it illegal by federal law, many municipalities throughout the United States, as well as the state of Colorado have moved to decriminalize it locally. Oregon has legalized the adult use of mushrooms, which currently must be administered within regulated ""psilocybin service centers."" (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)
Poison control calls are rising as more people use psilocybin, study finds

Means wrote that psilocybin and other psychedelics have been stigmatized. She touted the benefits of MDMA, also known as ecstasy or molly, for helping people with post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. The Food and Drug Administration last year declined to approve the use of MDMA as a therapy for PTSD after a panel of advisers found the research was flawed and there were significant risks in using it.


Means refers to psychedelics in her book as ìplant medicine.î She describes how she took mushrooms for the first time around Jan. 1, 2021, after she was inspired by ìan internal voice that whispered: itís time to prepare.î

ìI felt myself as part of an infinite and unbroken series of cosmic nesting dolls of millions of mothers and babies before me from the beginning of life,î she wrote, adding that in her experience ìpsilocybin can be a doorway to a different reality that is free from the limiting beliefs of my ego, feelings, and personal history.î

In a newsletter she published in October, Means said she had also used psychedelics to help her make ìspace to find love at 35.î She wrote that she ìdid plant medicine experiences with trusted guidesî to become ready for partnership, punctuating the line with a mushroom emoji. She noted she was not necessarily making recommendations that others do the same.

In a post this month about her White House health policy wish list, Means said she wanted more nutritious food served in schools, suggested putting warning labels on ultra-processed foods, called for investigations into vaccine safety and said she wanted to remove conflicts of interest. She did not specifically mention psychedelics but said that researchers have little incentive to study ìgeneric, natural, and non-patentable drugs and therapiesî and that a portion of research budgets should be devoted to alternative approaches to health.


Calley Means has also advocated for the use of psychedelic drugs, writing in a 2021 blog post that he first tried psilocybin during a challenging time in his life and ìit was the single most meaningful experience of my life ó personally, professionally, and spiritually.î He said in 2022 that he had ìsold all of my 401kî and bought stocks in two companies that are developing and researching psychedelics. He did not respond to messages seeking comment.

Casey Meansí confirmation hearing has not been scheduled. Trump chose Means after questions were raised about the resume of his first pick for surgeon general, former Fox News medical contributor Janette Nesheiwat, and he withdrew her nomination.

Why†podcaster†Dr.†John†Delony†approach†to†talking†about†uncomfortable†topics†is†resonating†with†millions,"ATLANTA
CNN
 ó 
Electric guitar swells in the background as a podcaster in a black shirt over his tattoos turns to speak directly to the camera.

ìI want you to write 10 things that you would love for your spouse or partner to do,î he says. ìHere is a roadmap to my chest, to my heart. Then ask them, ëWill you give me yours?íî

This podcasterís name is Dr. John Delony, and he hosts a show on conservative financial guru Dave Ramseyís network, Ramsey Solutions. Itís where he talks about mental health and gives advice to listeners who call in with problems that include repairing a marriage after infidelity, reconciling two sistersí opposing stances on abortion ññ and sometimes wilder topics, such as if a caller should leave their family for their best friendís wife.

Many times, callers begin their stories with, ìIíve never told anyone this before.î

With 1.2 million subscribers on YouTube, 1.5 million followers on Instagram and three books, Delonyís approach to talking about vulnerable things appears to be resonating with many people.

His callers represent a wide variety of people ññ men, women, conservative Christians, truck drivers, veterans, police officers and farmers ññ many of whom often heavily feel the stigma of struggling with mental health, being vulnerable and asking for help.

Part of why he works is that Delony doesnít fit the mental health counselor stereotype of someone in soft tones asking ëhow does that make you feel,í which is just a stereotype, said David Kessler, a death and grieving expert, author and one-time guest on Delonyís show.

Delony has a balance of presenting like the credentialed mental health professional he is and the good buddy who just wants to hear you out and offer a little guidance, Kessler added, which is what a lot of people are looking for.

Health officials have said the United States is facing a mental health crisis, and in 2023, nearly 1 in 4 adults around the world reported feeling fairly or very lonely.

Podcasts are not a replacement for therapy with a trained professional, and listeners should be aware that content around mental health can often be oversimplified, said Dr. Frank Sileo, a psychologist based in Ridgewood, New Jersey.

But platforms like Delonyís can provide benefit, he added.

ìListening to a podcast may be the first important step of a personís mental health journey,î Sileo added. ìPodcasts that focus on mental health issues can provide a wonderful forum for people to learn about all things mental health.î

Delonyís combination of a traditionally masculine appearance and open approach ó along with his doctorate in counselor education and supervision ññ might be one step toward connecting people in need with the tools and resources for better well-being.

Putting the politics aside
In a backstage Q&A at Atlantaís Fox Theater for Delony and Ramseyís ìMoney and Relationshipsî tour, the two men gave a teasing smile to an audience member who introduced herself as Rachel from California before asking a question.

ìOh yes, we know you, Rachel,î they said in mock annoyance, like old friends.

Rachel Guerrero traveled from California for 10 shows this tour, and she is going to the next shows in Fort Worth, Texas; Kansas City, Missouri; and Phoenix, she said.

ìBeing a single mom, itís not easy,î Guerrero told CNN. ìWhen I listen to his show and what he talks about, itís a caller thatís something totally different, but it applies to me.î

How can she afford all those trips, you ask? She credits Dave Ramseyís advice with her financial success.

Her feeling was common among audience members. They said they could trust Delony because he was connected to Ramsey and his Christian-based teaching. But they also say he knows what he was talking about because he had been through it himself, and that he just says it like it is.

Accruing this following wasnít the goal, Delony said. In fact, he had no social media accounts when he made the switch from higher education to podcasting.

Before joining Ramseyís company in 2020, he was giving a talk to parents of incoming students as Belmont Universityís dean of students about what they were about to face emotionally. A Ramsey Solutions executive was in the audience, and she later told Delony that she turned to her husband in the middle of the talk and said, ìIím hiring that guy.î

Becoming a public mental health personality wasnít appealing ññ it was scary, actually ññ but surrounded by a culture filled with yelling and turmoil, Delony said he felt motivated to take the job for his kids.

ìThis is the scariest thing I can do, but I want to be able to look at my kids and say, ëI tried to love people well, to give a picture of what loving people well in the public sphere looks like in the world that everyoneís yelling at each other,íî he said.

Meeting people where they are and sitting with them when they are hurting is both something fans like about Delony and something he said he prioritizes in his show.

Delony works for Ramsey Solutions, hosting his own podcast and cohosting ìThe Ramsey Showî radio program. Ramsey is a well-known evangelical Christian who has described himself as conservative and spoke in a podcast episode last year about voting for Donald Trump for president.

But Delony, who has also talked about his identity as a Christian, has been less direct about where he stands politically.

ìI guess the best way you could sum me up is the first time I went deer hunting, I had to put a gigantic buck in the back of my Prius,î he said. ìI kind of fall all over the place, and I think Iíve been kind of hard to nail down politically.î

ìI just love everybody, and everybodyís welcome at my house,î Delony added. ìItís always been that way.î

Prioritizing empathy for people who are hurting over where you stand on a particular issue is important, he said. Itís easy to demonize people with a political different stance in theory, but it is a lot harder to do that and show up for your friend or loved one when they are impacted by an issue you feel so against, Delony said.

And as much as Delony might have intended his show to be a place to nerd out over psychology and data, he said he has found that what most people need is someone to sit with them. No matter what side they stand on or what mess they have gotten into, he wants to be the person others know will sit with them over a tray of nachos and just talk it out, he added.

ìEven if they donít like me, theyíre like, ëI know that guy will share a drink with me, and heíll tell me the truth,íî Delony said.

Humans are built to live in a tribe, and when you donít have strong connections in your community, you can default to finding belonging in a political party, he said.

ìI work really hard to have other tribes so that Iím not reliant on somebody telling me who to hate, who to not like,î he said. ìIíve got communities that let my heart rest so then I can critically think, and I can examine, and I can sit around and share a table with people who I think have wacky opinions.

ìBut I love them, and theyíre hilarious, and they make me laugh, or they frustrate me, but them not being in my tribe isnít the goal of that communication.î

From classrooms to studios
Connecting with people is something that has roots in Delonyís childhood in Texas.

His father was a homicide detective in Houston, and someone who people in their church community would often go to for guidance, he said. Delonyís dad would get phone calls at all hours of the night. He would take those calls inside his closet ññ which shared a wall with young Delonyís bedroom.

Delony said he would fall asleep listening in on stories of people facing mental health issues or jail time, realizing that some of the people he went to church with every week were struggling with things he never would have suspected.

ì(Mental health has) just kind of been my whole life, from being a little kid all the way till now,î he said.

In college, Delony majored in psychology and humanities, got a masterís degree in higher education administration and then earned two doctorates, one in counselor education and supervision and another in higher education administration.

Much of his career has been in higher education, where he oversaw student services like residence life and counseling support services. His work in higher education also included crisis response.

But his connection with mental health also comes from his experience with his own, he said.

In his book, ìOwn Your Past, Change Your Future: A Not-So-Complicated Approach to Relationships, Mental Health & Wellness,î Delony explains a moment his anxiety reached a boiling point.

With a new baby, a country recovering from the 2008 financial crisis and a job helping college students in some of their most difficult moments, Delony writes that he became convinced that the foundation of his new house was crumbling. His wife didnít see it, nor did his friends ññ even the professionals he called to come check it out said he didnít have a problem.

But still, Delony couldnít let go of the fear that a storm would crack the foundation and destroy his young familyís home, he wrote. So, one night he found himself in the middle of the night crawling through the mud and rain with a flashlight, certain he would find evidence of the structural problem no one but him was worried about.

There was nothing. His home was fine, but Delony realized he was not, and he said that was one of the big moments that showed him he needed to address his anxiety.

Another story he often shares with listeners is the moment when he and his wife sat across the table from one another after years together, several miscarriages and two children, and they agreed they either needed to start their marriage over or stop being married.

They were faced with a choice ó end a marriage or learn some new tools for managing their relationship and building their connection, he said.

Building community
Delony and his wife, Sheila, did learn new relationship skills and are still together after more than 20 years of marriage. That meant him getting into therapy, and both of them learning how to be explicit about what they each needed and expected from one another, he said.

But many people find themselves sitting at their own tables across from their partners or looking in the mirror and finding that they arenít getting enough connection with their friends and family.

It makes sense, Delony said. Much of the interaction and community building you would get in the past has now been outsourced: People call a rideshare service instead of asking for a ride home from the airport and you use a delivery app for the cup of sugar you would have otherwise borrowed from a neighbor, he said.

The change has been particularly hard on men, who often have been socialized against vulnerability and toward only connecting with others in very specific ways.

ìIíll just use the old adage that women build community kneecap to kneecap, and men build it shoulder to shoulder,î he said.

Modeling can help parents teach boys to be good men.

For decades, many men in Western cultures have been taught that vulnerability ññ saying here is what I need or here is what I am struggling with ññ was dangerous; so relationships for many men were built through shared activity, Delony said.

Opening up for more connection in a world where many of those activities have been replaced by apps and screens might take intentional effort, he added.

Delony had a group of friends that maintained a tradition: Once a month, they chose one friend, gathered at his house and tackled his to-do list together.

ìIn one day, they would clean the carpets, change the front bumper, level the yard, paint the fence, whatever you needed done,î he said. ìEverybody ate pizza. Ö Everybody was working shoulder to shoulder on a project that when you got done, you came out your front yard and everybody high-fived, because this house and this family is different, because we all showed up.î

Now, after moving from Texas to Tennessee, he keeps putting himself out there for opportunities to get closer.

ìI have some rules that when I buy a concert ticket, I have to buy two, or Iíll buy four, and I just invite people,î he said. ìI have these little internal rules that I know at the end of a night Iím going to be better, or the night will have been better because I went with a buddy.î

And as people seem to get lonelier and more polarized, Delony said he hopes people like him will keep modeling how to be vulnerable, how to build new relationship skills when you have to and how to sit with all kinds of hurting people.","May 17,2025",Health,Madeline†Holcombe,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/17/health/john-delony-podcast-wellness,,,,,,,,,,,,atlanta cnn ‚Äî electric guitar swells

The†surprising†benefits†of†going†to†bed†angry†at†your†partner,"Arguments often feel urgent no matter whatís going on for some of the couples Dr. Samantha Rodman Whiten sees in her practice as a clinical psychologist in Potomac, Maryland.

This desire to resolve a conflict before heading to bed is particularly common for clients who grew up in a house where family members fought nonstop, said Whiten, author of ì52 E-Mails to Transform Your Marriage: How to Reignite Intimacy and Rebuild Your Relationship.î ìIt doesnít really occur to you to just shelve it and go to sleep.î

For others, the tendency is because of the age-old adage that you should never go to bed angry ó which sometimes comes from ìthe belief that unresolved anger can fester overnight, leading to deeper resentment,î said Dr. Sabrina Romanoff, a clinical psychologist in New York City, via email.

ìIts wisdom is likely to be rooted in the idea that resolution to arguments is essential for maintaining harmony and preventing even more emotional distance,î Romanoff said. ìHistorically, itís a call for connection and prioritizing the relationship over lingering negativity.î


Othersí resistance to dropping an argument for the night may stem from self-comparison or toxic positivity, Whiten said ó which can lead you to think you should be able to quickly discuss things with your partner, apologize, resolve the issue and happily call it a night.

Thereís also the concern ó sometimes in hindsight ó about what may happen if you let your partner go about their next day with that lingering resentment between you two or without having said I love you.

All considered, never going to bed angry sounds like a good rule to live by. But it isnít always useful, Romanoff said.

ìIts rigidity can overlook individual needs, rest and perspective,î Romanoff said. ìApplying this convention without discretion can actually be detrimental to your relationship.î


Putting an argument on pause and going to sleep upset is a skill you can practice, Whiten said. Hereís how to do it and still keep your relationship intact.

When you should call it a night
Delaying sleep to resolve an argument can backfire for several reasons.

When youíre exhausted, youíre less inhibited and thus have less control of your emotions, so youíre more impulsive and likely to say or do things you donít mean and will later regret, experts said.

Your problem-solving, listening and reasoning skills, which are all necessary for effective communication, can take a hit too, especially if youíre really worked up. Those factors, as well as being under the influence, can further exacerbate the problem, Whiten said.


A good nightís rest, however, can completely reset the brain.

Sleep ìreduces your brainís reactivity to negative stimuli ó or perceived negative stimuli ó helps process emotions and restores your ability to approach problems rationally,î Romanoff said. ìA well-rested brain is better equipped to engage in thoughtful, respectful communication.î

Sometimes, what you were arguing about will no longer seem important the next day. For whatever concerns that remain, though, youíll be more able to express them in a way thatís less emotional or defensive and, ultimately, better for the relationship.

Except on the rare occasions when something important and relevant to the conflict is about to happen late at night, Romanoff said all arguments should wait until the next day.

When youíre still too angry to sleep
Letís say you want to go to sleep but are struggling because the issue feels urgent, youíre lying awake ruminating while your partner is sleeping soundly, or youíre worried something bad might happen.

These feelings could stem from ìattachment panic,î Whiten said. Thatís the fear that your attachment figure or closest relationship, typically your parents in childhood or your partner in adulthood, isnít there for you or doesnít love you.


ìThatís very evolutionarily motivated to try to get back to a state where you feel secure in the relationship,î Whiten added.

In many of these cases, people feel the only way to manage their anxiety is to immediately try to repair things. But when youíre worked up and tired, conversations with your partner wonít go as well as when youíre calm and rested. In fact, these conversations may even lead to a situation that heightens your anxiety.

Regardless of why you just canít let it go, there are things you can do to settle down enough to get restful sleep.

In some relationships, one person wants to discuss conflict more than the other, Whiten said. That person may worry that if the conversation doesnít happen right away, it never will ó meaning the issue will never be resolved and the security and connection in the relationship will never be restored.

Thatís why experts said itís critical for couples to commit to a time and place to follow up as soon as itís reasonably possible and when youíre both in a better state of mind. Anticipating that things will be resolved soon can help calm you enough to sleep.


Couples can also try to maintain any bedtime rituals that reinforce the foundation of the relationship, such as saying ìI love you,î cuddling or kissing each other good night, Romanoff said.

Still engaging in these rituals communicates that your commitment to each other is more important than your current disagreement, offering reassurance without dismissing the conflict and balancing your immediate emotional security with the need for sleep, Romanoff said.

Emotions are generally fleeting, but your commitment to, and care for, your partner likely arenít. You can even say all these things.

If youíre reading this tip and thinking, ìIf Iím mad, thereís no way Iím saying ëI love you,íî that stubbornness is part of what leads to frequent conflict, Romanoff said.


ìThe more you say, ëI canít learn new ways of engaging,í the less likely the relationship is to work out,î she added. ìIn a healthy relationship, people are always learning new skills.î

You donít have to do these things happily or romantically ó a monotonous ìI love youî or a brief peck can still go a long way. Itís not about denying your anger but about affirming the bond you share, Romanoff said.

Self-regulating can also be important. You could try meditating, journaling, doing breathing exercises or distracting yourself by taking a quick shower or immersing your hands in cold water, Whiten said. Ask yourself, ìHow can I handle things in a way that will make my future self proud? How can I care for myself as a parent would care for a child whoís upset?î

Learning how to soothe yourself ìis the real deep work that many people do with anxious attachment, especially in therapy,î Whiten said.

Whenever you do have that follow-up conversation with your partner, remember that although arguments are inevitable, how you handle them defines your relationship and sometimes your sleep health, Romanoff said.

"Disrupted†US†vaccine†meetings†could†threaten†timelines,†access†and†transparency†around†shots","CNN
 ó 
Two long-planned vaccine meetings ó one at the US Centers for Disease Control and another at the US Food and Drug Administration ó have now been disrupted under the watch of US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., stirring questions about whether seasonal flu shots or other lifesaving vaccines will be delayed or harder to access.

The February meeting of the CDCís Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, was postponed ìto accommodate public comment,î according to a note online. The three-day meeting, which had been scheduled for this week, was to review the safety and effectiveness of vaccines for meningococcal disease, which is seeing a resurgence, as well as RSV, flu, chikungunya and mpox. It also included two votes related to Vaccines for Children, the government program that buys and distributes vaccines to state and local health departments for children whose families wouldnít otherwise be able to pay for them.

FDA meeting to choose flu vaccine composition canceled without explanation

ACIP typically meets three times a year, in February, June and October. Thereís no word on whether or when the February meeting will be rescheduled and itís unclear whether the delay will hinder access to shots.

On Wednesday, the FDA canceled a March 13 meeting of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, which was to discuss the recipe manufacturers must follow to make this fallís flu shots. No explanation was given for the cancellation.

In a statement to CNN on Thursday, the FDA said it would still weigh in on the makeup of flu shots but didnít indicate whether it would seek its advisersí guidance or allow for the public discussion and debate that usually occurs.

ìThe FDA will make public its recommendations to manufacturers in time for updated vaccines to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season,î the statement said.


The uncertainty around the governmentís process for regulating and recommending vaccines comes as the US is in the grips of a brutal flu season and experiencing a resurgence of measles, a vaccine preventable disease. Experts say these infections are increasing because of growing hesitancy to use vaccines, something they fear the new HHS director will only encourage.

Kennedy casts doubt on vaccine advisers
Kennedy maintains that he is not anti-vaccine, but he has repeatedly cast doubt on the safety and effectiveness of immunizations and questioned the research and regulations that allow them to be used.

Kennedy, whose financial disclosures show he has made money from law firms that sue vaccine manufacturers, has also impugned some of the experts who advise federal agencies on vaccines. During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy incorrectly stated that 97% of the members of the CDCís vaccine advisory committee had conflicts of interest. In fact, the panel has strict policies to guard against conflicts, and a screening process for members to ensure they are impartial when they vote.

Members of FDAís vaccine committee are also subject to strict conflict of interest rules and are required to disclose potential conflicts during meetings.

This week, former CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden wrote that false claims that ACIP members vote based on their financial ties is among the ìmost damagingî falsehoods about vaccines.

Frieden said the 97% figure comes from a 2009 report, issued when he was CDC director. He is now president and CEO of the nonprofit Resolve to Save Lives.

It was an audit of lengthy and detailed conflict of interest forms submitted by all experts who served as CDC advisers in 2007. He said 97% had at least one missing response, which could have meant someone forgot to do something as simple as initial a page. He said it is not the same thing as a conflict of interest.

ìI really think that this is classic misinformation,î Frieden told CNN.

Frieden also raised alarm about the postponed ACIP meeting, writing in a recent post on LinkedIn, ìItís certain there will be misleading, inaccurate information claiming ACIP members have conflicts of interest. Hereís the plain truth: ACIP, made up of pediatricians, public health specialists, and parents, is the gold standard for open, transparent recommendations on vaccine safety and effectiveness.î

Without either vaccine committee weighing in on vaccine regulation or recommendations, health-care providers worry there will be delays on vaccines or limits on peopleís ability to access them.

ìCancelling this meeting means vaccine makers may not have the vital information and time they need to produce and distribute targeted vaccines before the next flu season,î Dr. Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said after the cancellation of the FDA flu shot meeting. ìIf the FDA meeting is not immediately rescheduled, many lives that could be saved by vaccination will be lost.î

In a February 20 open letter to Kennedy, Acting CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez and Sen. Bill Cassidy, a doctor and chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, a coalition of groups called the Partnership to Fight Infectious Disease pushed for the ìprompt reschedulingî of the ACIP meeting.

ìEach ACIP meeting holds tremendous weight and relevance. Infectious diseases are constantly evolving opponents; vaccines are among the best tools for constantly adapting and responding to the latest public health threats,î the letter said.

ìMaking America healthy requires healthy discussion and timely, evidence-based decisions. This meeting should be no different.î

Flu shot decision in limbo
There are several different ways to make flu vaccines, but the most common is to grow the selected candidate viruses in chicken eggs ó a painstaking operation that takes months to finish.

For that reason, selection of the strains that will be included in flu vaccines is carefully orchestrated to be sure that manufacturers can deliver their shots to doctorís offices and pharmacies in time.

In order for flu vaccines to be sold in the US, they must contain strains that are officially selected by the FDA.

That decision typically comes after a meeting of the World Health Organizationís Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, a network of seven collaborating centers and four essential regulatory labs, which are based in the US, UK, Japan, China, Russia and Australia. Both the CDC and FDA are members, and representatives from both agencies participated in the deliberations which got underway this week, WHO said.

ìThe US did participate in this meeting,î Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHOís technical lead for Covid-19, said at a news briefing on Friday.

ìI want to be very clear that the US is still contributing. I know that thereís a lot of attention on the US right now, but we are going to continue to emphasize the importance of this global system thatís in place.î

These experts meet twice a year ó in the fall and spring ó to choose strains for countries in the Southern and Northern Hemispheres.

On Friday, WHO announced the strains that it thinks will most closely match the viruses that will be making people sick next fall. Those picks would swap out the H3N2 component of this years vaccine, which was only a partial match to the circulating viruses, for a new one.

ìI think the match is not perfect, but it is a reasonable match, and is still the best preventative we have against infection with influenza,î said Prof. Ian Barr, deputy director at the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory, and a member of GISRS, in a new briefing after the strain selection

The FDA said it will make public its recommendations to vaccine manufacturers in time for updated shots to be available for the 2025-26 flu season.

What typically happens next is that the 17-member FDA vaccine committee would meet and publicly discuss the recommendation, and then make its own endorsement. The agency ultimately makes the final decision, which can differ from its advisersí, although they generally align.

This year, there wonít be an advisory meeting. The FDA said it would still make recommendations to manufacturers but didnít specify how it would come to a decision or when.

ìIf thereís no FDA recommended strains, the US manufacturers are kind of stuck,î said Dr. LJ Tan who is chief policy and partnerships officer for nonprofit vaccine advocacy group Immunize.org.

Flu vaccine manufacturers contacted by CNN on Thursday said the missed VRBPAC meeting wouldnít break their stride.

ìJust as every year, we have already begun production for the 2025-2026 flu season in the Northern Hemisphere and will be ready to support final strain selections in time for the season,î wrote Sanofi in a statement to CNN.

GSK also said it will continue to work with FDA on its flu strain recommendation in the US.

But canceling the VRBPAC meeting will deprive Americans of public discussion and debate that happens when these experts meet. It makes the process less transparent, Immunize.orgís Tan said.

ìItís very dangerous to bypass your expert advisory committee,î Tan said.

When experts are out of the conversation
In his Senate confirmation hearings, Kennedy promised ìradical transparencyî at HHS.

ìPublic health agencies should be transparent and if we want Americans to restore trust in the public health agencies, we need transparency,î Kennedy said.

Vaccine advocates say canceling advisory committee meetings undermines that goal.

ìYou heard what we thought. We disagreed on some things, and for people who are interested, you can see how we arrived at the conclusion that we did,î said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a member of FDAís VRBPAC who is also a pediatrician and immunologist at the University of Iowa.

Perlman said he was also worried that skipping committee meetings would deprive the public of a window into the governmentís vaccine decisions.

ìThe country is in so much flux right now about what it thinks about vaccines, what it thinks about medical devices, what it thinks about drugs. The more transparency there is, hopefully, the more people who are undecided about things will see where the committee is coming from,î Perlman told CNNís Meg Tirrell.

Other experts agreed the committees are an important layer of independent review.

ìItís kind of taking experts out of the conversation,î said Dr. William Moss, a pediatrician who directs of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ìMany of these decisions are tricky and nuanced, and having the opportunity for a group of experts who are familiar with these vaccines and familiar with these diseases. You know, have an open discussion is critically important.î

The FDA has not said how it will choose vaccine strains for the fall, but if it follows WHOís recommendation, it will mean that the US will be relying on data from the organization despite President Donald Trumpís order that the US withdraw its support from WHO and stop sharing information.

ìItís part of the chaos, whether itís planned or not, or just incompetence,î Moss said.

4†people†sought†shelter†from†the†eruption†of†Mount†Vesuvius††and†sealed†their†own†fates,"Archaeologists have uncovered evidence that four people, including a child, in the ancient Roman town of Pompeii used furniture to block a bedroom door and shield themselves from the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79.

Ultimately, the home became their final resting place, according to new research published in April in the E-Journal of the Pompeii Excavations.

During the catastrophic eruption, the volcano spewed hot, lethal gases and ash into the air, slowly killing most of the cityís population. Ash and volcanic rock called pumice then covered Pompeii and its residents, eerily preserving the victimsí last moments for millennia.


The excavation team made the discovery while investigating the House of Helle and Phrixus, named for a mythological painting found in the home.

Researchers partially investigated the homeís front rooms between 2018 and 2019, but the team behind the new study revisited the site over the past couple of years, exposing one-third of the building in preparation to restore and open it to the public, said Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii.

A funerary relief of a couple, a man and a woman - almost life-size - belonging to a monumental tomb in the Porta Sarno necropolis, has emerged during an archaeological excavation, as part of the research project ì <em>Investigating the Archaeology of Death in Pompeii</em> î conducted by the Universitat de ValËncia in collaboration with the Archaeological Park (scientific direction of Prof. LlorenÁ Alapont).

ìExcavating and visiting Pompeii means coming face to face with the beauty of art but also with the precariousness of our lives,î Zuchtriegel said in a statement.


The investigation has also revealed that the home was under renovation during the time of the eruption, and ironically, the very art for which the house is named echoes the tragic events that unfolded within it, the researchers said.

A scene frozen in time
During the excavations, the team unearthed an atrium with a water collection basin, a banquet hall with lavishly decorated walls, a room with a central opening for rainwater and the bedchamber.

Small fragments of volcanic debris probably fell like rain through the opening during the first phases of the eruption, causing the four people inside the home to rush to the bedroom and blockade it with a bed to protect themselves.

But as the fallout from the eruption continued, the researchers believe the inhabitants pulled back the bed from the door and attempted to escape.

The Pompeiiansí remains were found in the banquet hall.

ìThe arrival of the first pyroclastic cloud that entered the ancient city or the collapse of parts of the upper floors could then have caused the death of the four victims,î the study noted.

Pyroclastic clouds, or a dense mixture of ash, gas and rock dispersed during a volcanic eruption, caused a searing, rapid avalanche of debris to fill the home, Zuchtriegel said. The team made a cast of the bed after identifying voids left by the decomposition of the bed frame and pouring plaster inside it to preserve its shape.

Archaeologists made a plaster cast of a bed frame that was pushed against a doorway by the home's inhabitants.

The scene is just one of many examples that serve as a reminder of the terror and agony faced by Pompeiiís residents as they attempted to seek shelter, he added.

ìMany took shelter in small rooms of buildings presumably, because they felt safer and more secure than in open areas exposed to the volcanic material raining down,î Zuchtriegel said. ìJust in the last year we have discovered a couple of victims who had barricaded themselves in the narrow entrance hall to The House of the Painters at Work. Having closed the doors at each end of the hallway, they must have believed and hoped they would be protected.î

Archaeologists have uncovered the bodies of a man and a woman with their treasure in Pompeii.

And in the House of the Thiasus, a young man and an older woman closed the window and door to a small room to protect themselves, only to get stuck there.

ìNevertheless, hours into the eruption (the victims) became trapped as the pumice accumulated outside, blocking any potential escape route should they have decided to flee,î Zuchtriegel said.

A tragic echo
In the home where the four people examined in the new study died, a central wall in the banquet hall has a fresco of Phrixus and his sister Helle from Greek mythology. As the myth goes, Helle and Phrixus escape their hateful stepmother Ino by flying away on a ram with golden fleece. But during the escape, Helle falls into a strip of sea, which was named Hellespont after her ó itís known today as the Dardanelles or the Strait of Gallipoli in Turkey.

The fresco captures the moment when Helle holds out a hand to Phrixus for help.

The ancient story likely no longer held any religious value for Pompeii residents and served merely as a decoration and status display, Zuchtriegel said. But in hindsight, it mirrors the desperate moments faced by the people trapped in the house during the eruption.

In the fresco, Helle can be seen reaching for her brother Phrixus' hand as she falls toward the sea.

ìThe discovery of a group of individuals, who perhaps represent only a few of the household, were clinging to hope of survival in the face of horror and tragedy much like Helle herself who, in the fresco that lends its name to the house, attempts to cling on to her twin brother in vain,î he said in an email.

ìWhen we excavate everything that we find is a surprise and in Pompeii those surprises come in the form of fragments and clues that can tell very personal stories but also shed light on the collective experience of loss and disaster in tandem with the hope and aspirations of the population,î Zuchtriegel added.

Pompeiiís distinctive homes
The removal of thresholds, missing decorations and portions of cut masonry at the entrance suggest the house undergoing a renovation ó but the disruption wasnít significant enough to keep people from living there or seeking refuge during the eruption. The house was also still full of elegant items and was well decorated, Zuchtriegel said.

In addition to the human remains, the team also found a bronze bulla, or an amulet worn by boys for protection until they reached adulthood.

The researchers also found a set of bronze pottery, including a cup shaped like a shell, a basket vase, a ladle and a single-handled jug.

ìEach house in Pompeii is unique,î Zuchtriegel said. ìEach has its peculiarities, its unique decorations, and its individual assortment of objects reflecting the personal choices and tastes as well as the fortunes and of course, misfortunes of its ancient occupants. The House of Helle and Phrixus was quite small, but it had marvelous paintings, which express the ambition of these people to rise in the social hierarchy. At the same time, they had to be careful not to lose their status.î","May

Ancient†three-eyed†predator†was†unlike†any†living†animal,"CNN
 ó 
With the help of more than five dozen fossils, paleontologists have uncovered a tiny three-eyed predator nicknamed the ìsea mothî that swam in Earthís oceans 506 million years ago.

Mosura fentoni, as the species is known, belongs to a group called radiodonts, an early offshoot of the arthropod evolutionary tree, according to a new study published Tuesday in the journal Royal Society Open Science.

While radiodonts are now extinct, studying their fossilized remains can illuminate how modern arthropods such as insects, spiders and crabs evolved. One of the most diverse animal groups, arthropods are believed to account for more than 80% of living animal species, said lead study author Dr. Joe Moysiuk, curator of paleontology and geology at the Manitoba Museum in Winnipeg.

Well-preserved specimens of the previously unknown Mosura fentoni also reveal something thatís never been seen in any other radiodont: an abdomen-like body region with 16 segments that include gills at its rear. This part of the creatureís anatomy is similar to a batch of segments bearing respiratory organs at the rear of the body found in distant modern radiodont relatives like horseshoe crabs, woodlice and insects, Moysiuk said.

The feature, likely used to help Mosura capture more oxygen from its environment, could represent an example of evolutionary convergence, in which similar-looking structures evolve independently in different groups of organisms, he said.

ìThe new species emphasizes that these early arthropods were already surprisingly diverse and were adapting in a comparable way to their distant modern relativesî said study coauthor Dr. Jean-Bernard Caron, the Richard M. Ivey Curator of Invertebrate Paleontology at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, in a statement.

A unique marine ëmothí
No animal living today quite looks like Mosura fentoni, Moysiuk said, although it had jointed claws similar to those of modern insects and crustaceans. But unlike those critters, which can have two or four additional eyes used to help maintain orientation, Mosura had a larger and more conspicuous third eye in the middle of its head.

ìAlthough not closely related, Mosura probably swam in a similar way to a ray, undulating its multiple sets of swimming flaps up and down, like flying underwater,î Moysiuk said in an email. ìIt also had a mouth shaped like a pencil sharpener and lined with rows of serrated plates, unlike any living animal.î

About the size of an adult humanís index finger, Mosura and its swimming flaps vaguely resemble a moth, which led researchers to call it the ìsea moth.î

Some of the Mosura specimens provided tantalizing traces of front claws, which helped the radiodont feed.

Caron used a miniature jackhammer to remove rock overlying the head of a specimen and found a perfect outstretched spiny claw tucked beneath, Moysiuk said.

ìUnlike many of its relatives which have claws lined with a meshwork of spines for capturing prey, Mosura has long, smooth-sided, finger-like spines that are forked at their tips,î Moysiuk said. ìItís a bit of a puzzle how exactly it was using these to capture prey, but (we) think it might have seized smaller animals with the tips of the spines and passed them towards the mouth.î

Researchers photographed one fossil under two different lighting conditions. One image (left) highlights the body shape, while the other image (right) showcases reflective traces of the gut, circulatory system, eyes and nervous system.

While there is no direct evidence of what Mosura ate, we know it lived alongside animals like acorn worms, bristle worms and small crustacean-like arthropods that the radiodont could have preyed on. In turn, Mosura may have been prey for other larger radiodonts, such as the shrimplike Anomalocaris canadensis, or the gargantuan jellyfish Burgessomedusa phasmiformis.

ìThis showcases there are yet more examples of these animals, specifically, forms that were active marine predators, filling in more of the picture of how this ancient marine ecosystem functioned,î said Dr. Russell D.C. Bicknell, a postdoctoral researcher in the American Museum of Natural Historyís division of paleontology. Bicknell was not involved in the new study but previously authored research on Anomalocaris canadensis.

Mosuraís unexpected trunk region challenges how researchers understand radiodont body evolution and how members of the group shifted from having wormlike bodies, said Rudy Lerosey-Aubril, an invertebrate paleontologist at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology who was also not involved with the new research.

ìIt may offer a rare glimpse into developmental processes, particularly in early members of the group, before evolutionary shifts led to the more consistent body organization seen in most known species,î Lerosey-Aubril said in an email.

A trove of fossils
The first Mosura fentoni specimen was discovered early in the 20th century by paleontologist Charles Walcott, who was the first known person to collect fossils from British Columbiaís Burgess Shale, a 508 million-year-old fossil bed. Walcott was the director of the US Geological Survey and administrator of the Smithsonian Institution. But no research about the Mosura specimen he found was ever published, and little was known about radiodonts at the time.

The other 60 fossils were collected by researchers at the Royal Ontario Museum between 1975 and 2022.

ìItís only with time and study of related species that the significance of these fossils gradually became clear,î Moysiuk said. ìMore recently, our team started finding additional specimens at new Burgess Shale sites in Kootenay National Park, which helped to spur on this publication.î

The fossils found in the Burgess Shale, located within the Canadian Rockies, represent a wide range of animals from the end of the Cambrian Period, when life diversified on a large scale. The Burgess Shale fossils are also known for being incredibly well preserved.

ìIn this study we were able to discern traces of the nervous, digestive, and circulatory system, which are almost never preserved as fossils,î Moysiuk said in an email.
ìThis provides unique and significant insight into life at this critical time in Earthís history.î

The team was able to spy traces that represented bundles of nerves in the eyes, which ó like modern arthropods ó Mosura used for image processing, Caron said.

Rather than arteries and veins, Mosura also had an open circulatory system, meaning that its heart pumped blood into lacunae, or large internal body cavities. The cavities were preserved as reflective patches within the body.

The discovery of numerous complete tiny radiodont specimens is remarkable, Lerosey-Aubril said. The fine details preserved within the fossil underscore the importance of the Burgess Shale, he added, and a broader picture of the full diversity of Cambrian animals will require investigating other sites that hold fossils and evidence of soft-bodied organisms.

Radiodont fossils are permanently on display in the Royal Ontario Museumís ìDawn of Lifeî exhibition, and a Mosura specimen will be on view at the Manitoba Museum later this year.","May

19th†century†shipwreck†discovered†off†Australian†coast†highlights†once†common†maritime†side†hustle,"CNN) ó Beneath the rough waters of South Australiaís coast, marine archaeologists say they have discovered the lost Dutch merchant vessel Koning Willem de Tweede, which sank nearly 170 years ago. The wreck captures a tragic moment in maritime history during the 19th century Australian gold rushes.

The 800-ton sailing ship was beginning its journey back to the Netherlands in June 1857 when a severe storm capsized the vessel near the port town of Robe, according to a news release by the Australian National Maritime Museum. Two-thirds of the crew drowned.

Just days before, 400 Chinese migrants headed for gold mines in Victoria disembarked from the ship. The crew transported the laborers as a ìside hustleî for extra money, according to James Hunter, the museumís acting manager of maritime archaeology. The practice was a common but questionably legal voyage at the time, he said.


While the captain lived to tell the tale and litigate his losses, the bodies of his crew members remain lost in the sand dunes of Long Beach.

However, on March 10, after three years of searching for the site of the wreck, a team of divers supported by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Netherlandsí Cultural Heritage Agency spotted what they say is the sunken vessel.

ìThereís always a little bit of luck in what we do,î said Hunter, who was the first diver to see the ship underwater. ìThe sand had just uncovered just a little bit of that shipwreck so that we could see it and actually put our hand on it and say ëweíve finally got it.íî

The expedition team members say they are confident theyíve found the Koning Willem de Tweede based on its location, which matches historic accounts of the wreck, and the length of the metal pieces detected, which matches the vesselís documented length of 140 feet (43 meters). Pieces of a 19th century Chinese ceramic were also found in 2023 on the beach near the wreck site.

ìShips were important and expensive, so they were often well-documented,î said Patrick Morrison, a maritime archaeologist at the University of Western Australia who was not involved in the finding. ìSo when material is found, it can be matched to accounts of the sinking and the shipís construction, like size, materials and fittings.î

Now, the museum, which partnered with the Silentworld Foundation, South Australiaís Department for Environment and Water, and Flinders University in Adelaide, will search for, recover and preserve artifacts from the wreckage that could reveal more details about 19th century shipbuilding, the crew and its passengers.

A finding anchored by history
Due to its long history as a global maritime trading mecca, Australia is a hot spot for shipwrecks, with an estimated 8,000 sunken ships and aircraft lying near its coasts. Some of the ships date to the 1700s, when colonization first began, according to the Australian governmentís Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water.

The discovery of gold mines in Victoria sparked a migration of Chinese laborers in the 1850s, leading the Victorian government to levy a £10 tax, worth over $1,300 (£1,000) today, on every migrant who entered its port, according to the Dutch Australian Cultural Centre.

To avoid this tax, agents in China would often pay for European merchant vessels to transport the migrants to other Australian ports, according to the National Museum of Australia. Upon arrival, the migrants were met with discriminatory treatment, and many were not successful in the mines, still owing a large portion of their earnings back to the agents.

The Koning Willem de Tweede was meant to do trading between the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies, a former colony thatís now Indonesia. However, just before returning home, the crew picked up the Chinese migrants from Hong Kong and dropped them off at Robe, a community about 365 miles (400 kilometers) west of the main ports in Victoria, from which the migrants trekked overland to the gold mines, Hunter said. To this day, itís unclear from the police reports, crew accounts and court records whether this voyage was sanctioned by the shipís owner.

What is clear, however, is the community of Robeís storied dedication to answering questions about the wreck and the lost crew members, he added.

As massive waves battered the ship to pieces, an Indigenous Australian man on land attempted to swim a rope out to the ship to save the captain but just couldnít make it in the surge, Hunter recounted. ìSo the captain wound a line around a little barrel, and he threw it into the water, and the townspeople who had gathered on the beach grabbed the line and pulled him through the surge and he survived.î

If the bodies of the crew members are recovered, Hunter said the Robe community will likely create a proper burial place for them.

ìShipwrecks reveal Australiaís long-standing maritime connections with the rest of the world, connections reflected in our towns and cities today,î Morrison said. ìI hear the team is planning to return. Iím sure each visit will reveal a new part of the story.î

The expedition team found part of the windlass, the machine used to reel in the anchor, protruding from the seabed.

What remains of the ship?
Itís still too early to tell, but Hunter said most of the shipís hull structure appears to be intact beneath layers of sand.

Using metal detectors and magnetometers, the team was able to locate large bits of steel and iron protruding from the seafloor that turned out to be parts of the frame and windlass, the machine used to reel in the anchor. Long planks of wood thought to be from the upper deck of the ship lie nearby, Hunter said.

ì(The hull) could teach us a lot about how these ships were built and how they were designed, because with that sort of information, thereís not a lot of detail in the historical record,î Hunter said.

Since the Koning Willem de Tweede sank hundreds of yards from the shore, the crew was not able to go back and recover their personal items, so itís possible the researchers could find coins, bottles, broken pottery, weapons and tools, according to Hunter.

Items recovered from the shipwreck must be retrieved carefully so they donít immediately disintegrate upon reaching the surface, said Heather Berry, a maritime archaeological conservator for the Silentworld Foundation, in an email.

ìAs always, shipwrecks rarely occur in calm waters,î Berry said. ìThe surge on the site is such that often you have to hold on to something sturdy to keep from being swept away, so we would need to ensure we donít accidentally grasp on to something fragile.î

The recovered artifacts are placed into tubs full of seawater that are then gradually desalinated to reduce the corrosive effects of salt upon drying.","May

Youíve heard the rule: No TV before bed.

But many people find that it helps them fall asleep if they listen to something ññ audiobooks, music, podcasts or TV shows.

A 2018 study found that more than half of people with sleep disturbances use music as a sleep aid.

It is poor sleep hygiene to look at screens to scroll or watch a show before bedtime, but what if you arenít looking, just listening?

Cell phones and screens are keeping your kid awake

ìItís like Goldilocks,î said sleep medicine specialist Dr. Rachel Salas, professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore. ìItís a matter of what works for you Ö Itís not only the practices of your bedtime routine, but your environment, all the things.î

Everyone is different, and some people might get great sleep if they fall asleep listening to something, Salas said. However, there are some practices to keep in mind to make sure you are maximizing the benefits and avoiding potential pitfalls.

Winding down to sleep
The key to listening to audiobooks, podcasts, music or TV to fall asleep is making sure it is helping you wind down instead of waking you up, said Dr. Shalini Paruthi, sleep medicine attending physician at John J. Cochran Veterans Hospital in St. Louis and adjunct professor at St. Louis University School of Medicine.

ìIf listening to something actually keeps a person more engaged or awake and therefore replaces sleep time, this can be detrimental to health,î she said in an email. ìIt is recommended that adults obtain at least 7 hours of sleep regularly for optimal performance.î

On the other hand, a predictable kind of noise can help tell your body itís time to wind down, Salas added.

ìIf you find that thatís part of your bedtime routine, and itís kind of comforting and relaxing Ö thatís great,î she said.

Try choosing content to listen to that will allow you to transition into sleep, added Dr. Lindsay Browning, a psychologist and sleep expert in Berkshire in the United Kingdom.

ìChoose something not too engaging so that your brain isnít motivated to stay awake and fight sleep to pay attention to it,î she said in an email.

A sleep story may be a better choice than audio of a book you want to read. Shows you have heard before and know how they end might be better than falling asleep to a nailbiter.

While you don't want to expose yourself to the light from screens before sleep, listening to a show or podcast can be done without ruining your night, experts say.

A soundtrack for sleep might help you get to sleep, but it doesnít always keep you asleep if it keeps going all night, Browning said.

ìItís important to set an auto timer to mute the sounds as soon after falling asleep as possible,î she said.

If the show, podcast, or music you are playing has unexpected noises, frequencies or volumes, it might alert your brain to pay attention, Salas said. The startling noise doesnít always wake you up fully, but it can cause many little awakenings you arenít aware of. That will disturb your sleep nonetheless, she added.

One steady sound, like white noise or ASMR, can help your sleep quality, especially if you live in a noisy area, Salas added.

ì(If) bars close at a certain time and people are outside, walking home and talking or yelling, thatís going to disrupt your sleep,î she said.

A consistent and non-alarming noise can stifle those kinds of ambient noise, she said.

What to do about insomnia
Sometimes listening to something to fall asleep isnít just a nice part of a bedtime routine ññ itís a way to quiet racing thoughts at night. Some proactive steps during the day may help, Browning said.

ìIf you find that your brain is too active as you try to fall asleep, which keeps you awake, you could try to address those busy thoughts and worries earlier in the day,î she said.

Methods include having a dedicated time earlier in the day to think about those worries or utilizing cognitive shuffling, a technique that involves thinking up random and non-emotionally charged words to take your mind off of your racing thoughts, Browning said.

ìItís a much better idea to try to learn ways of quieting a busy mind at night that donít require you to mask those unwanted thoughts with an external sound,î Browning said.

If you are using listening to something to help with insomnia and it doesnít seem to help after a two-to-four-week period, it might be time to see a board-certified sleep physician and get to the root of the problem, Paruthi said.

ìThere are several proven therapies that work well for insomnia treatment such as cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia, or when appropriate, medications can be considered,î she said.

Fewer nights out with friends, more take-out meals, less theatergoing. Americans are spending more time alone than ever before.

Whether this trend results from an epidemic of loneliness, which leaves people wanting for company, or a century of solitude, in which individuals prioritize solo time, the fact remains that more of us are on our own more often. But humans are social creatures whose well-being depends on belonging, and too much solitude comes with significant health consequences ó for individuals and society.

At the same time, the US health care system is ìexpensive, complicated, dysfunctionalî and possibly ìbroken,î experts say. Higher costs do not translate to better outcomes, and uneven access leads to avoidable disparities for people of color and other marginalized groups.

ìSocial prescribing,î which entails offering health care referrals for community activities, not just medications, can help on all fronts, argues solutions-focused journalist Julia Hotz. In her book, ìThe Connection Cure: The Prescriptive Power of Movement, Nature, Art, Service, and Belonging,î Hotz shares how nurturing interpersonal connections and encouraging community involvement can improve individualsí physical and mental health, while also strengthening communities. Cost-effective, and already popular in the UK, the social prescribing movement is gaining traction in the US.

As evidence mounts that meaningful relationships are as crucial to our well-being as diet and exercise, Hotz explains the science of connection and gives practical suggestions to help combat our growing isolation.

In her first book, ""The Connection Cure,"" Julia Hotz lays out the case for ""social prescribing"" and how it can improve health outcomes.

This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.


CNN: What is a social prescription?

Julia Hotz: Social prescriptions are health care referrals for activities and resources in your community. Recognizing the significant role that our environment, relationships and community play in our health outcomes, these prescriptions typically involve movement, art, nature, service and some element of belonging. When people are struggling with issues like anxiety, depression or even chronic pain, sometimes the most effective intervention isnít a just a pill but also reconnecting with community. Because social determinants account for 80% of our health, incorporating them as a healing modality just makes sense.

CNN: Are social prescriptions intended to replace conventional medicine?

Hotz: Not at all. This is about complementing traditional medications, therapies and other treatments with evidence-based social interventions. While I am concerned about overprescribing, I also have a lot of empathy for doctors who feel that medications, surgeries and other conventional treatments are their only options. Rather than replacing or taking away standard treatments, the goal of social prescribing is to invest in alternatives so weíre putting more, not fewer, options on the table. You can take your prescription antidepressant and take a walk with friends, and both can help with your depression.

CNN: Do social prescriptions work?

Hotz: The science supports the efficacy of prescriptions for movement, nature, art, service and belonging to ease symptoms of a range of diagnoses, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), chronic pain, dementia and loneliness. Exercise, for example, helps treat depression disorders, stress, anxiety and type 2 diabetes. Treating symptoms only through conventional therapies and medication misses the powerful impact that interacting meaningfully with other people in our communities has on our health.

Hereís an example from someone I interviewed: When Akeelaís back injury developed into chronic pain she had to leave her job. Without her work as a caretaker, she lost her sense of purpose and became very depressed. She tried every therapy, pill and surgery that doctors prescribed for her pain. Some of it helped.

But what really made her feel better was an unconventional prescription: volunteering for a childrenís health care charity. By turning the focus away from herself and her pain and toward care for others, the severity of her back pain lessened. In an era when so many people are suffering with chronic pain, itís critical that we take advantage of all available remedies ó even unexpected ones like volunteering in your community.

CNN: Do the same social prescriptions work for everyone?

Hotz: Social prescribing works because itís personalized. Itís not about pushing everyone into the same activities but connecting individuals with activities that resonate with their particular values and interests.

When her patients are struggling, pain psychologist Dr. Rachel Zoffness suggests that they visualize pain as a dial. Just as experiencing negative emotions, like sadness and anger, can turn the pain dial up, other things can turn it down, including distraction. She asks her patients to think of an occasion when they got so caught up in what they were doing that they forgot about their pain. When health care providers ask these kinds of questions, theyíre helping patients figure out the social prescriptions that might work best for them.

CNN: Do US health care providers issue social prescriptions?

Hotz: Although social prescribing is more mainstream in countries with nationalized health care systems, such as the UK, the movement is growing. An increasing number of providers are issuing social prescriptions around the 50 states. Social Prescribing USA, a nonprofit, tracks initiatives, pilots and research projects across the country in an interactive map.

Meanwhile, I recommend people begin by prescribing themselves spots in free or donation-based activities in their local communities. To find an ideal activity, people can ask questions like: What did I love doing as a child? If I had two extra hours in my day, what would I spend them on? What makes me lose track of time?

CNN: How does social prescribing help with loneliness?

Hotz: Loneliness has a profound effect on physical as well as mental health. If youíre lonely, youíre more likely to die prematurely; youíre more likely to be anxious or depressed or get dementia; youíre more likely to end up in the emergency room. The consequences of all that are equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day.

Because they align with a patientís interests and values, social prescriptions create meaningful connection ó the kind of connection that seems more compelling than staying at home. This has tremendous health benefits. The goal is not ìletís all get in a kumbaya circle and hold hands and be best friends and hug a stranger.î Instead, social prescriptions reconnect you with what matters

CNN: Why is social connection so important?

Hotz: Humans have evolved so that social connections are a need just as vital as food and water. Yet, record numbers of us are choosing to spend time alone. Life is exhausting. We work hard. Weíre burnt-out. Digital media might make us we feel like weíre constantly connected, but it leaves us so drained that we just want to retreat into our homes and not see anyone. We were not wired to live in the conditions that modern life demands.

CNN: How does online connection compare to in-person interaction?

Hotz: For some people ó such as those with limited mobility or individuals who feel isolated because of differences between them and their local community ó online connection can be a lifesaver. But most online interaction, particularly on social media, doesnít provide the elements of connection that are truly restorative.

Quality connection provides feelings of inclusion, being seen and affirmed for who you are and a true sense of belonging. Forging a real connection leaves you feeling like you know yourself better after spending time with that person. And that may be more beneficial for your health than spending time with 10 people who you donít know well.

CNN: How does creating a sense of belonging improve health?

Hotz: Solitude is important for some of us, some of the time. But when being alone becomes the norm, we can start to experience the health consequences of loneliness without even realizing it.

Science tells us that belonging is healing. The Harvard Study of Adult Development, which followed people for more than eight decades, names the strength of relationships as the No. 1 one predictor of health and longevity.

Volunteering and chatting with people in your community are easy ways to alleviate loneliness, experts said.

CNN: What are the societal costs of a lack of belonging?

Hotz: This has enormous consequences. People who lack a sense of belonging elsewhere can wind up becoming involved in sometimes very harmful and extreme political causes. Stories from former QAnoners, for example, often include discussion of depression, social isolation, loneliness and lack of belonging leading up to their getting sucked in.

People register social pain like physical pain, research shows. Even just witnessing social exclusion can activate our brain circuits. That can translate into a desperation that leads people to find belonging in places that do a lot of damage. Groups mobilizing to cause harm to people are growing in popularity because society is not provided something it once did.

We can counter this trend by investing in other spaces for connection ó local opportunities for engaging in movement, nature, art, service and belonging ó things that just happen to be really healthy for us, too.

CNN: You call those five options ó movement, nature, art, service and belonging ó the pillars of social prescribing. Whatís their significance?

Hotz: These five pillars are not just nice add-ons; these are requirements for our life. We know this is true because of how our health improves when we engage in these activities.

Moving our bodies releases serotonin and endorphins and improves our hippocampus function. Spending time in nature restores our attention and focus. Some studies have shown effects on par with taking Ritalin. Engaging in art reduces anxiety and trauma symptoms, which makes sense given how humans have used storytelling and art to cope with tough emotions since the beginning of time.

Service and belonging are the biggest because we didnít survive in the big, bad wild all on our own; we survived in a group. Just think about how, for generations, last names reflected our function within the community. Now, many of us are not engaging in communities but choosing artificial and often electronic sources of connection. Thatís when our health begins to suffer.

CNN: Whatís your sense of social prescribingís future in the US?

Hotz: Investing in social prescribing bridges divides, offering a bipartisan solution to address issues important to people across the political spectrum. Folks on the left are concerned about health care access and affordability. On the right, the Make America Heathy Again (MAHA) movement is concerned about pharmaceutical safety and reducing chemicals in our food and medicines while fiscal conservatives are focused on cost-cutting.

Not only does social prescribing provide significant health benefits, but it also actually saves money over time while reducing pressure on an overburdened system. Think of the 92-year-old who goes to the hospital just because she doesnít have anywhere else to go. Instead, prescribing her a weekly phone call with someone or a spot in a knitting group is going to save health care resources and ultimately save the taxpayer money.

If we want to invest in an approach that improves health outcomes, reduces health care costs and can appeal to people of all political persuasions, letís recognize the way our environments affect our health and prioritize social prescribing.

Beyonc's†mom†talks†about†the†choices†she†made†while†raising†her†daughters,"Tina Knowles remembers growing up in a loving and raucous family of nine. She was the youngest of seven children. Add in her cousins, and they were a force to be reckoned with whenever they left the house.

At a very early age, Knowles says she was taught not to draw any attention to herself. ìPretty is as pretty does,î her mom used to say.

In other words, be quiet, know your place.

Lucky for us all, she didnít listen. On a book tour for her new memoir, ìMatriarch,î an Oprahís Book Club selection, she talked to me at CNNís offices in New York about what she learned from her own childhood and her choices while raising her daughters, BeyoncÈ and Solange Knowles.

CNN
On Motherís Day weekend, hereís what the businesswoman, fashion designer and mother of two of the most famous entertainers in the world wanted to share.

Donít limit your children
Teaching kids to be seen and not heard was a common way of parenting back when ìMama Tinaî was growing up in Galveston, Texas, during segregation. Her mom, her teachers at her Catholic school and all the adults around her made clear what role she was expected to play.


To Knowles, that translated into trying to make herself small and insignificant ó even though she was born with a big personality, big feelings and many opinions. But Knowles simply couldnít follow the quiet rule and was quickly given a nickname: ìBadass Tenie B.î

ìThat was not a term of endearment when I was little,î Knowles told me in a recent conversation. ìThey used to just say, here comes that Badass Tenie B because I was hyper, I talked back.î Now, she says she recognizes her willfulness and hyper behavior stemmed from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. Which, she reflects, ìwasnít a thing then.î

As a child, Tina Knowles attended Catholic school, where she had teachers who negatively shaped her view of school.

Knowles attended a school where nuns ruled the roost. She said there were teachers who told her she didnít belong, that she was unsalvageable and a bad seed. The words punctured her soul and made her hate going to school.

ìThey thought they were doing the best thing,î Knowles said, but it hurt terribly.


She would run home to tell her mother and could not understand why her mom would never take her side. She didnít know her mother was working herself to the bone for the church to get Knowles and her siblings an education.

From her own experience at school and in her childhood community, Knowles said itís so important to really think about what you are saying to children. Labels can affect them for a lifetime.

ìI still fight with that sometimes,î she said, ìand Iím 71 years old. Itís in the back of my head: Donít bring too much attention to yourself. Itís OK if somebody else takes credit for what you did.î


Those words still cut, so she advises parents to do things differently. ìAdvocate for your kids. You have to protect your kids,î Knowles said. ìMake sure that the messages that theyíre giving your kids are ones that they can do anything they want to do and they do belong anywhere that they want to be.î

Itís exactly the message she imparted to her girls.

Pay attention to how you treat yourself

Your children are watching how you treat yourself, Knowles told me, noting that her loving mother, AgnÈz BeyincÈ, lived life in fear for her children as she tried to make sure they were not targets in the segregated US South.

But Knowles also watched her mother make exquisite outfits for all of her kids, and they were the best-dressed kids in town even though they were poor. (Knowles learned great lessons from her motherís work as a seamstress and ended up creating most of the outfits for Destinyís Child, Beyonceís singing group with Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams.)


ìAs poor as we were, we were always the sharpest kids and just took a lot of pride in fashion and how we looked and Ö I think it helped us not to know how poor we were,î Knowles said. ìI passed it on to my daughters Ö theyíre very talented at putting things together. They donít sew like I sew but they can put a button on, and they can put a hem in and take a dart in and that type of thing.î

Work against sibling rivalry
Knowles says she knew right away that BeyoncÈ had found her lifeís passion the first time she saw her daughter onstage. It was that obvious. But Knowles said her younger daughter could have done anything, and she didnít really want Solange to go into the music business.

ìI was terrified when BeyoncÈ turned around 10,î said Knowles, worried sheíd lose her children to their craft and that the work would create a wedge between the sisters.

According to Knowles, the kids in BeyoncÈís singing group would say to Solange every day, ìëBe quiet, Solange,í because she would try to choreograph (the group). You know sheís bossy, and she wanted to be involved.î


ìI started noticing that BeyoncÈ would allow them to talk to her like that,î she said. ìI saw a wall between them coming, and so I got them in therapy.î

While her family and community thought therapy could be problematic or even dangerous, she found a ìwonderfulî child therapist. As a result, the two sisters ìare now as close as they can be. No wedge will come between them.î

Knowles encourages other parents to do the same if they see an unhealthy sibling rivalry developing between your children.

Get screened for breast cancer

 ó 
Few things are as impressive to dinner party guests as a perfectly executed ‡ la minute pasta dish.

As a Roman-born foodie, I would argue that cacio e pepe, a Roman pasta recipe that is as delicious and simple as it is finicky, is a bold menu choice for the novice cook.

The name says it all: pasta, cacio (cheese) and pepe (pepper). Thatís it. Thatís the recipe.

ìThere is no margin for error with just pasta, Pecorino Romano cheese, and black pepper,î Michele Casadei Massari, CEO and executive chef of Lucciola Italian Restaurant in Manhattan, told CNN via email.

ìThe main challenge lies in achieving a stable emulsion: If the cheese is overheated or the starch-water balance is wrong, the sauce will separate,î Massari said.

When that happens, the pecorino forms a gloopy cheesy mess, sticking to everything but the noodles ó sad and naked.


So, how can one reliably avoid unpleasant dinnertime disasters? Either by practicing a lot ó and inevitably making mistakes in the process, as I have ó or by using science to guide the way.

Eight Italian physicists collaborated to crack the code of a foolproof cacio e pepe recipe, studying the properties of cheese, starch and water at different temperatures to learn how to replicate a flawless dish every time.

The study was published April 29 in the journal Physics of Fluids.

The magic trick? Adding a precise amount of cornstarch relative to the overall quantity of cheese used, to keep the dreaded clumps at bay.

When I first heard about the method, the Roman cuisine purist in me was skeptical.

Too many times, Iíve read cheat sheets for the perfect carbonara dish in which the solution to perfect, non-scrambled-egg sauce is to add cream (please, do not do this). In the interest of objectivity, I had to test the recipe myself and talk to these fellow Italians behind the research.

In a conversation in Italian, three of the study authors shared that the research came from their frustration for one too many cacio e pepe dishes gone wrong. Thanks to the groupís familiarity with the concept of ìliquid-liquid phase separation,î they knew how to investigate the problem scientifically.

ìAt some point, the eight of us were all at the Max Planck Institute in Dresden (Germany), some as PhD students, some as postdocs,î said study coauthor Daniel Maria Busiello, a statistical physicist at Italyís University of Padova. At that time, ìsomething weíd often do was cooking Italian recipes, not just for Italians, but for others as well.î

Making big batches of cacio e pepe to feed other hungry scientists turned out to be a near-impossible feat. ìThere were problems with controlling the temperature of the sauce and of the noodles, causing these clumps,î Busiello said.

ìI remember a time the dish came out inedible. Something clicked then,î said study coauthor Ivan Di Terlizzi, one of the groupís top cooks, and a statistical physicist at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden.

The physics of a pasta problem
Di Terlizzi approached fellow researcher Giacomo Bartolucci, now a biophysicist at the University of Barcelona in Spain, with a working theory about possible commonalities between the behavior of cacio e pepe sauce and that of aqueous solutions of proteins inside cells. Bartolucci had focused on phase separation and the aggregation of proteins for his doctoral research.

The scientists set out to understand whether the cheese and water in this recipe could be scientifically described as ìa system that undergoes phase separation at high temperatures,î in Busielloís words.

ìWe had a theoretical framework and a practical problem,î Busiello added.

Innovating on traditional Italian recipes, even on solid scientific grounds, is a high-risk endeavor. Given the touchy subject, the study authors are of course all Italians, by design.

ìIf we have to piss off a bunch of people, at least let it be eight Italians who did it,î Di Terlizzi said.

To investigate the behavior of cacio e pepe sauce under heat, the researchers conducted experiments recreating the cooking process in a controlled setup.

ìWe prepared small batches of sauce using precise amounts of cheese, starch, and water, and gradually heated them using a sous vide device to carefully control the temperature,î Di Terlizzi explained.

ìAt each stage, we took a small sample of the sauce, placed it in a petri dish and photographed it from above to observe how clumps formed. This allowed us to track how changes in temperature and ingredients affected the smoothness of the sauce.î

Avoiding the ëMozzarella phaseí
The researchers found that the concentration of starch in the sauce is the key factor influencing its stability. If the proportion of starch falls below 1% of the total cheese weight, the cheese will enter what the authors call the ìMozzarella phaseî ó in which clumps are inescapable and the dish is ruined ó at lower temperatures. A 2% to 3% starch-to-cheese ratio yields the best results.

In the recipe for two published in the study, the researchers used 5 grams (0.18 ounce) of cornstarch or potato starch dissolved in water, heated up gently to form a gel, then cooled down with more water before being blended with 200 grams (7 ounces) of pecorino cheese.

Sodium citrate, a common additive used to make smooth mac and cheese, also worked well in their recipe, although according to Di Terlizzi it lent the dish a slightly ìcheese singleî aftertaste.

The scientifically engineered pecorino cream can withstand temperature changes better than the classic cheese-starchy water mixture made with pasta cooking water and can even be reheated.

Temperature is in fact another key factor that can make or break the sauce, which has to do with how the proteins in the cheese behave when heated.

Writer Francesca Giuliani Hoffman said the more stable, smooth sauce in the scientifically optimized recipe she prepared at home meant the final mixing of the ingredients was less time-sensitive.

ìThe sauce is stable if created at low temperatures and the starch bonded with the proteins. If, after that happens, you expose the sauce to high temperatures, proteins can no longer interact,î Di Terlizzi said.

If the emulsion of cheese and starch happens at high temperatures though, ìthereís no guarantee that proteins will bond with other proteins, which causes the aggregation, before they bond with the starch.î

The scientifically optimized recipe will yield solid results for large batches of pasta, as the stable sauce will give you more flexibility dealing with a large volume of piping hot noodles, cooling down more slowly than a smaller batch of pasta would.

When trying the scientifically optimized recipe, donít throw away all the pasta cooking water! Youíll still need some of it in the final mixing of all ingredients (the ìmantecaturaî in Italian). Just be careful to let it cool down slightly.

Testing the physicistsí recipe
When I tested the recipe, the instructions felt straightforward, and the process was quick, though it required a few more steps than what Iím used to (such as forming the starch gel on the stove).

It was frankly odd to work with a pecorino cream that felt so smooth ó it almost reminded me of a jarred sauce. Nothing changes as far as the pepper goes. Just crack as much of it as youíd like and toast it in a pan to release its aroma.

My husband and I enjoyed the dish. It tasted great, and dealing with a pecorino cream that needs much less babying at the stove and allows for a much less time-sensitive mantecatura is a definite plus. Also, who doesnít love the idea of a cacio e pepe party for a crowd?

My only qualm is that knowing there was starch added in the sauce, my perception of the dishís mouthfeel was definitely skewed, but that wasnít the case for my husband.

As a proud Roman home cook, my pursuit of a perfect classic cacio e pepe will be a life-long experiment, but the scientifically optimized recipe exceeded my expectations and would be a good initiation for home cooks who have been put off by the dishís treachery thus far.

A chefís advice for the traditional dish
But what exactly makes the traditional way of making this dish, by emulsifying the cheese with pasta cooking water, so challenging?

Itís practically impossible to know just how much starch is naturally present in the pasta cooking water, so the success of the crucial emulsion is more of a gamble, but there are tricks to mitigate catastrophe.

One, coming from Massari, is to use less water to boil the pasta.

ìFor cacio e pepe, I recommend using about 6 to 8 cups of water for 7 ounces of pasta, which translates to a ratio closer to 1 part pasta to 6ñ7 parts water by weight ó significantly less than in traditional pasta cooking,î the chef said.

A classic rule of thumb for cooking pasta, according to Massari, is to use about 1 quart of water for every 3Ω ounces of pasta, and 2 teaspoons of salt.

The researchers, who used an arbitrary 10-to-1 ratio of water to pasta in their experiments, also said that reducing that volume of water by two-thirds generally concentrated the natural pasta starch to a safe degree.

Massari also recommends emulsifying the cheese and pasta water below 60 degrees Celsius (140 degrees Fahrenheit), which is in line with the new studyís findings on temperature.

ìI first create a cold cheese cream, using finely grated Pecorino and a small amount of the pastaís starchy cooking water, blending until smooth. Then, I toss the pasta off the heat with the cream and freshly cracked black pepper, adding extra water to adjust the texture,î Massari said. ìThe result should be a silky, cohesive sauce that clings beautifully to every strand of pasta, not a broken or heavy coating.î

ìThe natural starch from properly handled pasta is more than sufficient to achieve a creamy, stable, and authentic sauce without compromising the nutritional integrity of the dish,î Massari added.

Another chefís trick to buy you some time while attempting the recipe the traditional way is ìpasta regenerationî ó which involves partially cooking the pasta for about 70% of its time, immediately shocking it in ice water to stop gelatinization and finishing it later before serving.

ìThis method preserves al dente texture while enhancing the final release of surface starch, which is crucial for stabilizing delicate emulsions,î Massari explained.

Celebrating with their tested recipe
The researchers said their scientifically optimized recipe has surged to meme status, online and offline.

ìSome social media users were hypercritical about the recipe we proposed, despite it being used before in prestigious restaurants,î Di Terlizzi told CNN. ìOverall, I can say that excitement prevailed, especially in the scientific community,î he added.

ìWe wonít say we invented the definitive method,î Di Terlizzi said, but this method will save you from ruining good, expensive and hard-to-source pecorino cheese.

For the researchers, thatís personal: ìWeíre in Germany. We have that shipped to us all the way from Italy. We canít just buy it at the store every day,î Di Terlizzi said. ìSo, when the dish turns out badly, that bothers us.î

A big pasta dinner celebrated the publication of the paper, with the researchers preparing at least 4 pounds of pasta for a crowd.

ìWe were on pins and needles because our diners all knew about the experiment ó but it worked perfectly,î Busiello said.

Bartolucci added, ìThat was our trial by fire.î

The scientifically optimized cacio e pepe recipe we tested
This is CNNís summary of the recipe presented in the study. You can find Pecorino Romano DOP ó which stands for Protected Designation of Origin, a certification of a productís origin and quality assigned by the Italian government and the European Union ó and tonnarelli pasta at Italian grocers and online specialty stores.

Serves 2

Ingredients

ï Salt

ï 5 grams (2 teaspoons) cracked black peppercorns, plus more for serving

ï 5 grams (2 teaspoons) cornstarch or potato starch

ï 200 grams (1 Ω cups, firmly packed) pregrated Pecorino Romano DOP (such as Fulvi, Locatelli or Cello), plus more for serving

ï 300 grams (10.6 ounces) pasta, preferably tonnarelli (spaghetti or rigatoni also work well)

Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.

2. While the water comes to a boil, add peppercorns in a single layer to a dry pan over medium-low heat. Toast until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove pepper from heat immediately.

3. Make the starch gel. In a small saucepan, dissolve the cornstarch by whisking it into 50 grams (3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon) cold water. Heat the mixture gently over low heat until it thickens and turns nearly clear. Remove the starch gel from heat and whisk in 100 grams (6 æ tablespoons) water to cool. The mixture will return to a liquid state.

4. Make the pecorino cream. Add the starchy water, grated cheese and peppercorns to the bowl of a food processor and pulse to combine until a smooth cream forms.

5. Cook the pasta according to the package directions until al dente, reserving 237 milliliters (1 cup) of pasta water before draining. Drain the pasta and let cool for up to 1 minute.

6. Mix the pasta with the sauce, ensuring even coating, and adjust the consistency by gradually adding pasta water as needed. Keep the sauce slightly runny as it tends to thicken as it cools. If needed, the dish can withstand gentle reheating (up to 80 or 90 C, 176 to 194 F) to reach serving temperature.

7. Sprinkle with additional grated cheese and pepper and serve immediately.

ìI recommend using high-quality spaghettoni pasta made from durum wheat semolina, bronze-extruded and slow-dried at low temperatures,î Massari told CNN. ìI prefer using Matt, a heritage durum wheat cultivated mainly in Puglia and Sicily.î

You can find matt spaghettoni, Sarawak black peppercorns and Pecorino Romano DOP at online specialty stores.

Serves 2

Ingredients

ï Sea salt, preferably coarse Sicilian sea salt

ï 5 grams (1 teaspoon) freshly cracked Sarawak black peppercorns, plus more for serving

ï 100 grams (1 cup, firmly packed) pregrated Pecorino Romano DOP (such as Fulvi, Locatelli or Cello), plus more for serving

ï 200 grams (7 ounces) spaghettoni, preferably matt durum wheat spaghettoni

Directions

1. Bring 6 to 8 cups of lightly salted water to a boil in a large pot. Toast the black pepper in a dry pan over medium-low heat until fragrant. Remove pepper from heat immediately.

2. Cook the spaghettoni according to the package directions until slightly al dente, reserving 237 grams (1 cup) of cooking liquid while itís cooking.

3. While the pasta is cooking, prepare a cold emulsion by mixing grated Pecorino Romano with a small ladle of warm pasta water (ideally under 60 C, or 140 F) in a medium bowl until it forms a creamy base.

4. Drain the pasta slightly al dente, then transfer it to the pan with the pepper.

5. Toss the pasta with the Pecorino cream, gradually adjusting with more pasta water to create a glossy, smooth sauce that perfectly coats the noodles. Add more black pepper and cheese before serving.

Eating more ultraprocessed food ups the risk of premature death, study finds

ìOur research shows that eating too much processed food, like sugary sodas and packaged snacks, might be speeding up early signs of Parkinsonís disease,î said senior study author Dr. Xiang Gao, a distinguished professor and dean of the Institute of Nutrition at Fudan University in Shanghai, China, in a statement.

This latest study is part of the ìgrowing evidence that diet might influence the development of Parkinsonís disease,î Gao said.


While the study found that people who ate more ultraprocessed foods tended to report more early symptoms, it did not find a direct increase in the risk of Parkinsonís disease itself, said Dr. Daniel van Wamelen, a clinical senior lecturer in neuroscience at Kingís College London. He was not involved in the new research.

ìThe study did not track whether participants were diagnosed with Parkinsonís later on,î van Wamelen said in a statement. ìThat said, having more of these symptoms suggests a higher risk over time.î

Brain health begins ëat the dinner tableí
The study analyzed years of health and diet data on nearly 43,000 participants of the Nursesí Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, two studies in the United States that have been gathering information on health behaviors for decades. The average age of people in the study was 48, and none had Parkinsonís disease at the beginning of the study. All self-reported what they ate every few years ó a limitation of the new research as participants may not have remembered their food intake accurately.

Ultraprocessed foods measured by the study included artificially or sugar-sweetened beverages; condiments, sauces and spreads; packaged sweets snacks or desserts; yogurt or dairy-based desserts; breads and cereals; and packaged savory snacks.


The study found a link between early signs of Parkinsonís disease and all types of ultraprocessed foods except breads and cereals ó a finding that indicates an underlying feature among most classes of ultraprocessed foods that may explain the results, the study said.

One reason could be ultraprocessed foods typically have less dietary fiber, protein and micronutrients ó but do have added sugar, salt, and saturated or trans fats, the study said. Ultraprocessed foods also may impact the balance of flora in the gut, while additives may increase inflammation, free radicals and neuron death, the study said.

ìWith a sample size exceeding 42,800 participants and a long follow-up period up to 26 years, this study stands out not only for its power but also for its methodological rigor,î wrote the authors of a corresponding editorial published with the study.

The editorial was coauthored by Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, an associate professor of clinical neurology at Columbia University in New York City, and dietitian Maria Maraki, an assistant professor of sports medicine and exercise biology at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece. Neither were involved in the new research.


ìThe prevention of neurodegenerative diseases may begin at the dinner table,î they wrote. ìExcessive UPF consumption not only is a risk factor for metabolic diseases but may also accelerate neurodegenerative processes and associated symptoms.î

Early symptoms appear years before motor function declines
In the new study, published Wednesday in the journal Neurology, researchers looked at the prodromal stage of Parkinsonís disease ó early signals that appear years to decades before the tremors, stiff muscles, slow gait and changes in posture that are hallmark symptoms of Parkinsonís.

Body pain, constipation, signs of depression, changes in the ability to smell or see colors, and excessive daytime sleepiness can all be early signs of Parkinsonís disease, according to the Parkinsonís Foundation.


An extremely unusual sleep disorder, in which people can move during REM, or the rapid eye movement stage of sleep, is also a key early sign, according to research. The body is typically paralyzed during REM sleep so it cannot get up and act out any dreams.

The study found that people who ate about 11 servings a day of ultraprocessed food ó compared to people who only ate three ó had a 2.5-fold greater likelihood of exhibiting three or more of the early signs of Parkinsonís.

In addition, eating more ultraprocessed foods was tied to an increased risk for nearly all symptoms except constipation, according to the study. This finding held true even after researchers accounted for other factors, such as age, physical activity and smoking, that might impact the results.

American adults say sticker shock at the grocery store is making it harder for them to have a healthy diet, according to a nationally representative survey of adults by the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan fact tank that conducts data-driven research.

Ninety percent of adults in the United States say the price of healthy food has risen over the past few years, and over two-thirds (69%) say higher food prices are making it difficult to eat a healthy diet.

Those with fixed or lower incomes were hardest hit, with 47% reporting difficulty in eating healthy meals compared with only 15% of upper-income adults, according to the survey of 5,123 adults conducted during the week of February 24 to March 2.

ìIt is a bigger challenge for the lower-income adults, but itís not as if the middle- and upper-income Americans are completely spared,î said Eileen Yam, director of science and society research at Pew, which is based in Washington, DC.

ìEven middle- and upper-income Americans are reporting the increased price of healthy food is making it more difficult to eat healthy,î Yam said.

Thatís partly due to a reliance on a Westernized diet that focuses on costly animal foods, such as meat and dairy, said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine who founded the nonprofit True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine. He was not involved in the Pew survey.

ìBeans and lentils are stunningly nutritious, and very economical. Cooking grains are highly nutritious, and very economical,î Katz said in an email. ìMore dishes featuring these, and fewer featuring costly animal foods, would allow for a decisive improvement in diet quality while lowering overall cost.

ìSo, too, of course, would drinking more plain water and less sugar-sweetened beverages,î he added. ìThe impediment is not prices, but food label literacy.î

The American diet is unhealthy
More than 1 million Americans die each year from diet-related diseases such as obesity, cancer, heart disease and type 2 diabetes, while unhealthy diets and food insecurity cost the United States an estimated $1.1 trillion in health care expenditures and lost productivity annually.

Objective measures of diet quality in the US conducted by scientists show that the American diet is substandard. Over 50% of adults fail to meet the diet recommendations of the American Heart Association, an April analysis found.

Regardless, nearly 60% of adults in the Pew survey rated their diets as somewhat healthy.

ìAmericansí ability to report the quality of their diet is highly suspect,î Katz said. ìWe do not rely on people to ëguesstimateí their own blood pressure; we should not be expecting them to ëguesstimateí their diet quality either.î

People who ate more meals at home were most likely to rate their diets as healthy, the survey found. About one-third of Americans who cook and eat at home rated their diets as extremely or very healthy. However, only 12% of those who ate out more often considered their diet satisfactory.

How Americans make food choices
Taste is the most important factor in choosing food, with 83% of adults listing taste as extremely or very important, according to the survey. Less than 50% of respondents said the same about the healthiness of food, however.

ìWhether weíre looking at race, ethnicity, gender, income, taste is way up there at the top,î Yam said. ìAfter taste, Americans care most about cost, the healthiness of the food and then convenience.î

Low cost, convenience and taste are hallmarks of ultraprocessed foods. Food manufacturers entice consumers with combinations of sugar, salt, fat and additives designed to meet a ìbliss pointî of tastiness. In the United States, some 71% of the food supply may be ultraprocessed, a 2019 study estimated.

Ultraprocessed foods contain ingredients ìnever or rarely used in kitchens, or classes of additives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing,î according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

Numerous studies find higher amounts of ultraprocessed food raise the risk of obesity and the development of chronic conditions including cancer, cardiovascular disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes and depression. Such foods may even shorten life.

Research also shows that switching to a plant-based diet, such as the Mediterranean diet, can improve health at any age.

ìItís never too late to adopt healthy eating patterns, and the benefits of eating a healthy diet can be substantial in terms of reducing total premature deaths and different causes of premature death,î said Dr. Frank Hu, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology and chair of the department of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

ìPeople also have a lot of flexibility in terms of creating their own healthy dietary pattern,î Hu told CNN in a previous interview. ìBut the common principles ó eating more-plant based foods and fewer servings of red meat, processed meats, added sugar and sodium ó should be there, no matter what kind of diet that you want to create.î

 ó 
It was the first day that felt like spring in New Hampshire, and college students swarmed the green in front of the colonial buildings on campus to hang out in the longed-for sun.

It wasnít even warm yet, at least to me. Back home in South Carolina, the temperatures were already reaching the 80s. But the students on the campus where I will likely attend college littered the grass anyway, and dozens of speakers, all playing different music, created a delightful layering of noise.

It was a stark contrast to the first time I had ever visited a college, four years ago, when I was tagging along for my older brotherís college tour.

Campuses were empty during our car trip up and down the Eastern Seaboard. None offered tours for prospective students. No students laughed outside. Instead, one university had yellow-shirt-clad security guards driving around on golf carts and ensuring that anyone walking around outside wore a paper mask. Another campus had biohazard-orange signs posted around its edges, warning strangers against entering.

That was during the 2020-2021 school year. I was in eighth grade, when we ate lunch outside in winter coats at school. We sat alone in assigned spots, two kids on opposite ends of a 6-foot-long (nearly 2-meter-long) picnic table to maximize the distance between us. I carried a battered and fraying paperback copy of J.D. Salingerís ìFranny and Zooeyî in my too-big coatís pocket, even after Iíd finished reading it.

Covid-19 regulations were in full swing that school year. I felt lucky to return to in-person school, yet I was the loneliest I have ever been.


Itís been five years since the Covid-19 lockdowns began, and weíre beginning to see how it affected my generation. In some magical way, Iíve almost forgotten it ever happened. I have blocked out the absurdity ó and the loneliness.

Volunteering and chatting with people in your community are easy ways to alleviate loneliness, experts said.

Growing up, at a distance
That first Covid year was filled with mindfulness exercises in homeroom, encouragement to do yoga, meditate, reflect and journal in the morning announcements. You have the power to improve yourself and your life was their message. I like to think ó I sincerely hope ó it was because adults understood that the isolation that came with social distancing was hurting us. But no one mentioned another possibility: If you have the power to change yourself for the better, you have the power to screw yourself up, too.

How do you know if youíre changing for the better if you have little input from peers, if you have no friends around in real life to sort out new ideas, new identities, new interests?

Thereís so much research that says adolescents need to be surrounded by peers, need to have friends, to help shape their identity and feel a sense of belonging. As kids reach adolescence, they become increasingly more independent from their families. Itís natural to pull away from our parents. Detachment helps kids to become more autonomous, preparing them for adulthood, when theyíll strike out on their own. Friends are there to fill some of the gaps, helping each other grow into new, more independent people.

What happens when you place an entire generation, one thatís still growing up, under quarantine and social distancing rules? And you do it, not for days or months, but for years?

I think about the kids whose schools were closed for a year or more, who were homebound for months. How can you begin to separate from your parents if youíre constantly with them? If theyíre your only companions?

When school was shut down in the final few months of seventh grade, I was ecstatic. It had been a hard year. We were all 13 or nearly 13, and all in the throes of puberty. Acne, smelliness, mood swings and massive bodily changes plagued us. Going home for the last eight weeks of school felt like a respite that I treasured.

Online school was a drag, but I got through it OK. At home, I bonded with my older brother, with whom I only used to fight. We were once so nasty toward each other that one of my motherís biggest sadnesses was how much we seemed to hate each other. I grew much closer to my parents, too.

My friends and I still talked through texting and group chats. There were dozens of chats with dozens of combinations of people. But for me, they didnít feel warm, communal or fun.
I felt disconnected, cut off from organic conversations that someone replies to immediately because youíre right there in front of them and from conversations being joined by people you donít really know well enough to text or have a group chat with.

I guess I was lucky that I was only home for a few months. My time at home was freeing and family-centered. I did miss my friends, but it was an idle, half-thought longing.

In August of 2020, I went back to in-person school for my eighth-grade year. At school, my friends were right there in front of me but untouchable and unreachable. Our desks were far apart, and we were all masked. You couldnít whisper to your friends anymore.
You could barely talk, except during a short recess. Even then, we had to be masked and stand far apart. It was hard to read expressions, hear inflections. We all were inhabiting the same space, but I did not feel like we were together.

It became our moral duty to be lonely. There were reminders plastered everywhere to stay 6 feet apart. We were told we were ìprotecting each otherî if we stayed away from other people, that we were empathetic, caring and good members of society.

If someone was seen hanging out with people, close and maskless, they must be a bad person. They must be selfish. They must not care about human life. They must not want to protect society. This is what we were told. To feel intense guilt for a basic, once-accepted human desire for companionship hurt. Staying away from people became celebrated, a moral good.

It seemed to me that a new expectation permeated American life: We should be OK with being alone. If we were not, we were weak or even bad people.

But what does it do when children internalize the idea that they are bad, careless people if they want to spend time with friends?

We are starting to know what the effect was
Young Americans (18-29 years old) are still struggling with profound social effects five years later, according to a March 2025 poll from the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. One in five became more socially isolated.

Of those young Americans who reported social isolation during the pandemic, 55% also reported depressive symptoms. Even among those who said the pandemic had no long-term effects on their friendships, 38% still reported depressive symptoms. Fewer than half of all surveyed said they felt a sense of community in their current life.

The study also showed that present-day isolation rates vary by age. Researchers found the highest levels of isolation were reported among those who were entering their first years of high school or college during the lockdowns. Those kids, now 19 and 23 years old, had isolation rates of 38% and 40%, respectively. Among 20-year-olds, only one year older, only 23% reported social isolation.

Looking back, five years later, I donít know who I wouldíve been now, without the Covid restrictions. I donít know what might have happened if I, and the rest of my generation, had experienced a more typical path to adulthood. What would we be like if we had been surrounded by peers to help form our growing selves in those crucial years of early adolescence?

The stressors of the pandemic may have led to premature brain development among teens, according to a new study.

I feel like Iíve missed something essential about growing up, but I donít know what. And I am aware that I was actually one of the luckiest of my generation: I have kind parents, I was happy at home, my school reopened as soon as possible, and the teachers and staff there cared deeply about our well-being and did all they could to support us students.

I carried that book in my jacket pocket as something of a talisman. I saw myself in the main character Franny. She was older and cooler than me, but she was also trying to figure out her place in the world and who she was. What I loved about Franny was that when she tried to change her life for the better, she utterly failed. She sent herself spiraling into an emotional meltdown of spiritual pain and confusion. She was a warning that I remember as I prepare to enter college in a few short months.

I reread ìFranny and Zooeyî every year, and I will pack it for college wherever I go. Franny may have started my love of the book, but what made me carry it in my pocket like a religious medal was her brother Zooeyís advice to her: You cannot forget the value of humanity, no matter what happens. You cannot view yourself as separate, as other. You cannot let your sadness at the state of the world grow personal. To cut yourself off from people is to lose your connection and way in a glorious, terrifying world.

In those depressive and lonely days of Covid, that idea was a lifeline.

These can all be symptoms of the menopause transition, a natural process that a woman goes through as her brain and body wind down and eventually shut off the ability to reproduce.

But honest and open discussions about menopause and the years leading up to it ó called perimenopause ó have, until recently, been nonexistent. Womenís experience have been either ignored or superficially played out in public for laughs, often resulting in a shroud of secrecy and feelings of shame.

Treating menopause as taboo even made the process a mystery to the very people going through it.

ìWhen I first started to notice changes in my body, I was probably Ö 46, 47-ish,î Emmy-award winning comedian and writer Samantha Bee told CNN Medical Correspondent Meg Tirrell recently on the podcast Chasing Life With Dr. Sanjay Gupta. ìAnd I was starting to do my own show. ëFull Frontalí had just kind of started, and I was under just Ö immense amounts of stress, no question.


ìAnd I really started to feel like I was not coping well,î she said. ìMy body was changing ó I was having physical changes ó and I actually, literally didnít know what was happening.î

Bee, who rose to fame first as a correspondent on ìThe Daily Show With Jon Stewartî and later with her own series, ìFull Frontal With Samantha Bee,î said she would stop getting her period for a couple of months here and there. Her hair also started falling out in a way that didnít feel typical. And she developed frozen shoulder, started sweating at night and was on an emotional roller coaster with her insides ìroiling.î

Because the majority of her friends are a little younger than she is, Bee said she thought she was ìgoing crazyî because of her job.

She finally confided in her gynecologist that she wasnít sleeping well and ìturning into Lady Macbeth.î

ìAnd she was like, ëOh, youíre in perimenopause.í And I was like, ëThereís a word?íî Bee recounted, noting that at the time the topic hadnít really broken the surface of popular culture.

ìWeíre all talking about it now, and you can read about it, and people are like, ëYeah!í But eight years ago: zip, like zero information,î she recalled. ìNobody in the conversation. Not cool. Very unsexy. Mention it and you are just like a witch-crone who lives in a cave, donít come out. Ö I would never in a million years have thought, ëOh, Iím in perimenopause.íî

Beeís most recent project, ìHow to Survive Menopause,î was born out of her own bewildering experience. She performed her one-woman show in New York City in October 2024, where it was recorded live and adapted for audio by Audible.

Having a word and a framework for what she was going through, Bee said, helped put her ìon a path of knowledge.î


ìYouíre de-pubertizing,î Bee said. Her doctor had this helpful guidance: ìëRemember all the torment you felt Ö when you were 15 and Ö every zit was an operatic tragedy? She was like, ëThatís what that is, but just in the other direction.íî

The No. 1 thing that helped Bee most, she said, ìis that you have to find a community of people that you can talk to, even if itís just one person.î

ìJust saying the words out loud and normalizing it. Itís normal. It literally happens to 50% of the population,î she said. ìItís good to make a joke about. Itís good to say it out loud. Thatís actually the main thing that has helped me.î

What was not helpful, she said, was turning to social media. ìI donít like to take advice from people who are trying to sell me any type of product. Ever.î


Whom did Bee trust? For advice and guidance, in addition to her own doctor, she turned to a woman who has been called ìthe internetís gynecologist,î Dr. Jen Gunter. Gunter, who authored the best-selling ìThe Menopause Manifesto: Own Your Health With Facts and Feminism,î is known for debunking myths about this stage of life.

ìShe told me that some of what happens when you are in perimenopause is that your brain is creating new neural pathways because itís kind of cleaning itself out,î Bee said. ìItís kind of scrubbing out all of the neural pathways related to getting pregnant, feeding a baby, all of those early childhood, maternal pathways in your brain. It clears a little bit of space so it can be a time of tremendous creativity.î

Gunter, who said she likes to call it the ìmenopause experienceî or the ìmenopause continuum,î agreed that we donít talk enough about perimenopause and menopause.

ìIf youíve never heard about it, how would you really know whatís going on with your body?î she told Tirrell on a separate episode of the Chasing Life podcast.


You can listen to the full episode here.


ìA lot of women get their symptoms dismissed,î she said. ìBut also, the symptoms can be really nonspecific.î

For example, she said, women can have irregular periods, heavy bleeding, hot flashes and brain fog for other reasons. ìSo, thereís a combination of reasons that a lot of people donít realize thatís what it is until theyíre in the middle of it.î


How menopause is discussed in the wider culture can also be impactful.

ìHow you talk about something actually changes your thoughts about it,î Gunter pointed out.

ìIt means that we have a mind-body experience,î she said. ìEverybody around you is telling you that youíre an ugly old hag whose ëtime has come,í and all youíre seeing are 70-year-old men dating 20-year-old girls. Ö You could see how someone would feel worse about maybe the changes happening to their body.î

Gunter said we speak in euphemisms about men. ìThey have ëerectile dysfunction.í We donít say ëpenile failure,íî Gunter said. ìIf we talked about menís bodies the way we talked about womenís bodies, woof, that would be a whole different ball game.î

So, what do women need to know about the menopause experience? Here are Gunterís top five facts.

The ëwhatí of menopause
Menopause marks the end of an individualís reproductive years. The ovaries cease releasing eggs. ìThis is when ovulation stops,î Gunter said via email. ìThis means estrogen levels eventually decrease, and production of progesterone stops.î


But the progress is not gradual or linear. ìHormones can be chaotic in the time leading up to menopause, which is known as the menopause transition.î

Remember the chaos of puberty? ìThink of menopause like puberty in reverse,î she said.

When does menopause start?
The menopause transition typically starts at the average age of 45, according to Gunter. ìThe average age of menopause 51 and the normal range is 45-55.î


ìThis means for some women symptoms may start in their early 40s, but for others there may be no symptoms until their late forties or even early 50s,î she added via email.

In other words, everybody is different, which makes it an unpredictable ride.

The diagnosis of menopause
Gunter explained that an individual reaches the milestone of menopause when she has not had a period for one year. ìMenstrual irregularity is normal in the menopause transition, and when people are reliably skipping a period then menopause is likely 1-3 years away,î she said.


No blood or urine tests exist that can indicate whether someone is close to menopause, according to Gunter. Blood work isnít even needed for the diagnosis. ìIf you are over age 45 and have gone a year without a period, that makes the diagnosis,î she said.

But sometimes more testing is required. ìBlood work is indicated if someone is younger than age 45 and going 3 months or more between periods. The reason for the testing is to identify the cause of the irregular bleeding, and one cause may be premature menopause (age 40- 44) or primary ovarian insufficiency (under age 40),î she said.

For people who donít get their periods for other reasons ó due to using a hormone IUD or having had a hysterectomy ó Gunter said doctors go by symptoms other than bleeding, for example hot flashes.

Symptoms and medical concerns
Symptoms can vary greatly from person to person, affect many body systems, and start and resolve at different times.


ìThe most common symptom in the menopause transition is irregular periods, but they can also be heavy,î Gunter said.

ìEveryone is different. Hot flashes and night sweats are common symptoms,î she noted. ìDepression, brain fog and joint pain can happen as well. Vaginal dryness, pain with sex and an increased risk of urinary tract infections are also common concerns.î

Menopause also ushers in some physical vulnerabilities. ìThe risk of osteoporosis increases with menopause. Menopause also marks a time when there is a change in the risk of diabetes and heart disease, so itís important to be checked for diabetes, have your blood pressure checked and also your cholesterol and lipids,î she said.

A variety of treatment options
The best therapies for you will depend on your symptoms and health risks, Gunter said.

ìMenopause hormone therapy (also known as hormone replacement therapy) is the gold standard for hot flashes and night sweats, and for women who choose this therapy, it should be an FDA-approved product,î she said via email. ìHormone pellets and compounded hormones are not FDA-approved and not recommended as the dosing is inconsistent and can lead to unnecessary and serious health concerns.

ìMany women have heard the word bioidentical, but it is a marketing term. That being said, women should know that most hormones approved by the FDA are bioidentical,î she said.

Should all women entering menopause be on it? ìWe do not recommend that every woman take menopause hormone therapy, rather (that) it be prescribed for specific reasons where we have data to show it works or that is biologically plausible that it could help,î Gunter explained.

There are several key lifestyle opportunities as well, Gunter said, such as not smoking and eating a balanced, healthy diet. She recommends aiming for 25 grams of fiber every day.

ìItís also important to do resistance training and do aerobic exercise, as this improves many health domains,î she said, noting, however, that there is no need to go overboard by, say, running marathons or engaging in competitive weight lifting if you donít already enjoy these activities.

To maintain physical fitness, aging adults can follow the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity weekly and two days per week of muscle-strengthening activities of moderate intensity.

ìThere are no menopause-specific supplements that have been shown in rigorous studies to help with symptoms. Considering the menopause gold rush, I recommend people steer clear of those who sell supplements as their content online is almost always geared for sales, not education,î she said.

But if a person has a specific health concern, such as low iron or low vitamin D levels, Gunter said in the podcast, a supplement can be of value. Look for one that has been certified by a third party, such as US Pharmacopeia (USP) or the NSF (the National Sanitation Foundation).

Gene†editing†helped†a†desperately†ill†baby†thrive.†Scientists†say†it†could†someday†treat†millions,"A baby born with a rare and dangerous genetic disease is growing and thriving after getting an experimental gene editing treatment made just for him.

Researchers described the case in a new study, saying heís among the first to be successfully treated with a custom therapy that seeks to fix a tiny but critical error in his genetic code that kills half of affected infants. Though it may be a while before similar personalized treatments are available for others, doctors hope the technology can someday help the millions left behind even as genetic medicine has advanced because their conditions are so rare.

ìThis is the first step towards the use of gene editing therapies to treat a wide variety of rare genetic disorders for which there are currently no definitive medical treatments,î said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert who co-authored the study published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The baby, KJ Muldoon of Clifton Heights, Pennsylvania, is one of 350 million people worldwide with rare diseases, most of which are genetic. He was diagnosed shortly after birth with severe CPS1 deficiency, estimated by some experts to affect around one in a million babies. Those infants lack an enzyme needed to help remove ammonia from the body, so it can build up in their blood and become toxic. A liver transplant is an option for some.

Knowing KJís odds, parents Kyle and Nicole Muldoon, both 34, worried they could lose him.


ìWe were, like, you know, weighing all the options, asking all the questions for either the liver transplant, which is invasive, or something thatís never been done before,î Nicole said.

ìWe prayed, we talked to people, we gathered information, and we eventually decided that this was the way we were going to go,î her husband added.

Within six months, the team at Childrenís Hospital of Philadelphia and Penn Medicine, along with their partners, created a therapy designed to correct KJís faulty gene. They used CRISPR, the gene editing tool that won its inventors the Nobel Prize in 2020. Instead of cutting the DNA strand like the first CRISPR approaches, doctors employed a technique that flips the mutated DNA ìletterî ó also known as a base ó to the correct type. Known as ìbase editing,î it reduces the risk of unintended genetic changes.

Itís ìvery excitingî that the team created the therapy so quickly, said gene therapy researcher Senthil Bhoopalan at St. Jude Childrenís Research Hospital in Memphis, who wasnít involved in the study. ìThis really sets the pace and the benchmark for such approaches.î


In February, KJ got his first IV infusion with the gene editing therapy, delivered through tiny fatty droplets called lipid nanoparticles that are taken up by liver cells.

While the room was abuzz with excitement that day, ìhe slept through the entire thing,î recalled study author Dr. Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, a gene therapy expert at CHOP.

After follow-up doses in March and April, KJ has been able to eat more normally and has recovered well from illnesses like colds, which can strain the body and exacerbate symptoms of CPS1. The 9 Ω-month old also takes less medication.

Considering his poor prognosis earlier, ìany time we see even the smallest milestone that heís meeting ñ like a little wave or rolling over ñ thatís a big moment for us,î his mother said.


Still, researchers caution that itís only been a few months. Theyíll need to watch him for years.

ìWeíre still very much in the early stages of understanding what this medication may have done for KJ,î Ahrens-Nicklas said. ìBut every day, heís showing us signs that heís growing and thriving.î

Researchers hope what they learn from KJ will help other rare disease patients.

Gene therapies, which can be extremely expensive to develop, generally target more common disorders in part for simple financial reasons: more patients mean potentially more sales, which can help pay the development costs and generate more profit. The first CRISPR therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for example, treats sickle cell disease, a painful blood disorder affecting millions worldwide.


Musunuru said his teamís work ó funded in part by the National Institutes of Health ó showed that creating a custom treatment doesnít have to be prohibitively expensive. The cost was ìnot far offî from the $800,000-plus for an average liver transplant and related care, he said.

ìAs we get better and better at making these therapies and shorten the time frame even more, economies of scale will kick in and I would expect the costs to come down,î Musunuru said.

Scientists also wonít have to redo all the initial work every time they create a customized therapy, Bhoopalan said, so this research ìsets the stageî for treating other rare conditions.

Carlos Moraes, a neurology professor at the University of Miami who wasnít involved with the study, said research like this opens the door to more advances.

ìOnce someone comes with a breakthrough like this, it will take no timeî for other teams to apply the lessons and move forward, he said. ìThere are barriers, but I predict that they are going to be crossed in the next five to 10 years. Then the whole field will move as a block because weíre pretty much ready.î","May 15,2025",Health,Associated Press,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/15/health/personalized-gene-editing-baby,,,,,,,,,,,,baby born rare dangerous genetic disease growing thriving getting experimental gene editing treatment made just researchers described case new study saying he‚Äôs among first successfully treated custom therapy seeks fix tiny critical error genetic code kills half affected infants though may similar personalized treatments available others doctors hope technology can someday help millions left behind even genetic medicine advanced conditions rare ‚Äúthis first step towards use gene editing therapies treat wide variety rare genetic disorders currently definitive medical treatments‚Äù said dr kiran musunuru university pennsylvania gene editing expert coauthored study published thursday new england journal medicine baby kj muldoon clifton heights pennsylvania one million people worldwide rare diseases genetic diagnosed shortly birth severe cps deficiency estimated experts affect around one million babies infants lack enzyme needed help remove ammonia body can build blood become toxic liver transplant option knowing kj‚Äôs odds parents kyle nicole muldoon worried lose ‚Äúwe like know weighing options asking questions either liver transplant invasive something that‚Äôs never done before‚Äù nicole said ‚Äúwe prayed talked people gathered information eventually decided way going go‚Äù husband added kj muldoon center sits siblings followup dose experimental geneediting treatment april chloe dawsonchildrens hospital philadelphia via ap kj muldoon center sits siblings followup dose experimental geneediting treatment april chloe dawsonchildrens hospital philadelphia via ap chloe dawsonchildrens hospital philadelphiaap within six months team children‚Äôs hospital philadelphia penn medicine along partners created therapy designed correct kj‚Äôs faulty gene used crispr gene editing tool won inventors nobel prize instead cutting dna strand like first crispr approaches doctors employed technique flips mutated dna ‚Äúletter‚Äù ‚Äî also known base ‚Äî correct type known ‚Äúbase editing‚Äù reduces risk unintended genetic changes it‚Äôs ‚Äúvery exciting‚Äù team created therapy quickly said gene therapy researcher senthil bhoopalan st jude children‚Äôs research hospital memphis wasn‚Äôt involved study ‚Äúthis really sets pace benchmark approaches‚Äù february kj got first iv infusion gene editing therapy delivered tiny fatty droplets called lipid nanoparticles taken liver cells room abuzz excitement day ‚Äúhe slept entire thing‚Äù recalled study author dr rebecca ahrensnicklas gene therapy expert chop followup doses march april kj able eat normally recovered well illnesses like colds can strain body exacerbate symptoms cps ¬Ωmonth old also takes less medication considering poor prognosis earlier ‚Äúany time see even smallest milestone he‚Äôs meeting ‚Äì like little wave rolling ‚Äì that‚Äôs big moment us‚Äù mother said still researchers caution it‚Äôs months they‚Äôll need watch years ‚Äúwe‚Äôre still much early stages understanding medication may done kj‚Äù ahrensnicklas said ‚Äúbut every day he‚Äôs showing us signs he‚Äôs growing thriving‚Äù kj muldoon sits parents kyle nicole muldoon siblings april kj muldoon sits parents kyle nicole muldoon siblings april chloe dawsonchildrens hospital philadelphiaap researchers hope learn kj help rare disease patients gene therapies can extremely expensive develop generally target common disorders part simple financial reasons patients mean potentially sales can help pay development costs generate profit first crispr therapy approved us food drug administration example treats sickle cell disease painful blood disorder affecting millions worldwide musunuru said team‚Äôs work ‚Äî funded part national institutes health ‚Äî showed creating custom treatment doesn‚Äôt prohibitively expensive cost ‚Äúnot far off‚Äù plus average liver transplant related care said ‚Äúas get better better making therapies shorten time frame even economies scale kick expect costs come down‚Äù musunuru said scientists also won‚Äôt redo initial work every time create customized therapy bhoopalan said research ‚Äúsets stage‚Äù treating rare conditions carlos moraes neurology professor university miami wasn‚Äôt involved study said research like opens door advances ‚Äúonce someone comes breakthrough like take time‚Äù teams apply lessons move forward said ‚Äúthere barriers predict going crossed next five years whole field move block we‚Äôre pretty much ready‚Äù
"First†on†CNN:†Dangerously†high†levels†of†arsenic†and†cadmium†found†in†store-bought†rice,†report†finds","Samples of store-bought rice from more than 100 different brands purchased in the United States contained dangerously high levels of arsenic and cadmium, according to a new report shared first with CNN.

ìEven at low levels, both arsenic and cadmium have been linked to serious health harms, including diabetes, developmental delays, reproductive toxicity and heart disease,î said coauthor Jane Houlihan, research director for Healthy Babies, Bright Futures. The organization, which is dedicated to reducing childrenís exposure to toxic chemicals, produced the report.

ìHeavy metal contamination in young children is especially concerning, as early-life exposures are associated with reduced IQ and a range of cognitive and behavioral problems,î Houlihan said.

One in four samples of rice purchased from grocery and retail stores across the United States exceeded levels of inorganic arsenic set in 2021 by the US Food and Drug Administration for infant rice cereal, according to the report published Thursday.


ìThe FDA set a limit for inorganic arsenic in infant rice cereal of 100 parts per billion, and since then weíve seen levels in those cereals drop by 45%,î Houlihan said. ìBut the FDA did not address inorganic arsenic levels in the rice families purchased to cook and serve.

ìYet it turns out that for very young children, ages 0 to 2 years, rice is a more important source of inorganic arsenic than infant rice cereal,î she added. ìItís really the rice itself thatís driving higher exposures.î

Arsenic is a natural element found in soil, water and air, with the inorganic form being the most toxic. ìInorganicî is a chemical term and has nothing to do with the method of farming.

Arsenic is also a carcinogen, and early-life exposures ó including during pregnancy ó are especially dangerous, possibly leading to spontaneous abortion, stillbirth and preterm birth as well as later neurodevelopmental disorders, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.


The USA Rice Federation, which represents American growers, told CNN via email that rice grown in the United States contains the lowest levels of inorganic arsenic in the world.

ìWhile we do not agree that there is a public health safety issue as a result of trace amounts of arsenic in rice, we will continue to work with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure the U.S. rice supply meets any threshold established,î said Michael Klein, vice president of communications and strategic development at USA Rice.

ìIt is worth noting (that) the top source (42%) of arsenic in the diet of Americans is fruits, vegetables, and fruit juice. Rice is 17 percent,î Klein said.


Thatís an unfair comparison, Houlihan said, because dozens of different fruits and vegetables contribute to that figure of 42%.

ìIn contrast, rice alone ó one specific food ó contributes 17%, likely making it the single largest individual food source of arsenic in the American diet,î she said.

A global concern
Rice is the ìmost widely consumed solid food in the world,î according to the report, and a regular part of the diets of more than 1 billion children globally. In some cultures, rice is served at every meal.


ìOn average, for all children ages 0 to 2 years, rice accounts for 7.5% of their arsenic exposure, more than any other solid food,î Houlihan said. ìFor Hispanic and Latino children of the same age, that level rises to 14%.î

However, many Latino families are not aware of the dangers of arsenic in rice, said Juan Roberto Madrid, an advocate for the environmental advocacy association GreenLatinos, which partnered on the new report.

ìIn fact many of our full time staff were not even aware of the dangers of arsenic in rice,î Madrid said in an email. ìOur communities must understand what arsenic does to babies and that there are alternatives available. This is not a cause for alarm, but rather a cause for concern.î


For Asian children, the levels are even higher, Houlihan said. ìFor babies 0 to 2 (years), rice accounts for 30.5% of the arsenic in their diet. Itís even higher for Asian children between 18 (months) and 24 months. Rice accounts for nearly 55% of their arsenic exposure.î


Some Asian families are aware of the presence of heavy metals in rice, but not the dangers posed by arsenic, said Gloria Tan, executive director of Gum Moonís womenís residence at the Asian Womenís Resource Center in San Francisco. Gum Moon, which stands for ìgolden door,î has been providing services to Asian women since 1868 and was a partner in the new report.

ìKnowing that there are dangers of arsenic might make families reconsider their rice choice,î Tan said in an email. ìI think some families may be receptive to the idea of switching to a less contaminated grain.î

Comparing rice with ancient grains
The new report analyzed the total heavy metal content in 145 samples of rice varieties grown in India, Italy, Thailand and the United States that were purchased by shoppers in the US.


ìThe researchers used a certified, accredited lab to measure arsenic and other heavy metals in rice samples, confirming that this is an issue with real-world implications,î said Tasha Stoiber, a senior scientist at the Environmental Working Group, via email. EWG is a consumer organization that monitors exposure to heavy metals, plastics and other dangerous chemicals. Stoiber was not involved in the new research.

Ancient grains such as farro often contain significantly fewer heavy metals, the report said.

The independent lab also tested another 66 samples of nine ancient grains: amaranth, barley, buckwheat, bulgur, couscous, farro, millet, quinoa and spelt.

Results showed rice purchased by shoppers contained 28 times more arsenic than the alternative grains. The group of alternative grains, however, contained 1.5 times more cadmium than rice. Still, overall levels of heavy metals were three times lower in the nine grains compared with the levels found in the purchased rice.


Like arsenic, cadmium easily crosses the placental barrier to the fetus, potentially causing neurodevelopmental harm. Cadmium is also a known carcinogen and has been connected to harm to the kidneys, bone, stomach, lungs and more.

ìMost research has focused solely on arsenic, but that leaves out an important part of the rice safety story,î Houlihan said. ìBy including cadmium in our analysis, weíre able to give a more complete picture of how different rice types compare in terms of overall toxic metal exposure.î

Rice type and growing region matter
The type of rice and how itís grown and processed can impact levels of arsenic and other heavy metals, experts say. Brown and wild rice often contain the highest levels because the milling process used to create white rice removes the outer layers of the hull, where heavy metals are concentrated.


Lab testing found purchased samples of US-grown brown rice contained 151 parts per billion of heavy metals ó 129 of that due to arsenic. Arborio rice grown in Italy, which is typically used to make risotto, and white rice grown in the Southeast US (often labeled as simply ìUSAî) were almost as high in total heavy metals as brown rice, the report said.

Arborio rice from Italy contained 101 parts per billion of arsenic ó total heavy metal load in the purchased samples was 142 parts per billion. White rice grown in the US contained 95 parts per billion of arsenic, with a total heavy metal count of 118 parts per billion.

Basmati rice from India, jasmine rice from Thailand and California-grown sushi and Calrose rice (a form of sushi rice) were at or below the 100 parts per billion levels set by the FDA for arsenic in infant rice cereals. However, the Indian basmati and Italian Arborio varieties contained the highest average levels of cadmium.

The California-grown rice had the lowest overall heavy metal content ó 65 parts per billion, with 55 parts per billion from arsenic ó making it an excellent choice to reduce overall exposure, Houlihan said.


Consumers should be wary, however, of precooked rice, including instant (one-minute and five-minute rice), parboiled (10-minute rice), and ready-to-heat-and-eat packaged rice, she said.


ìStudies have shown the processing used to create instant rice can create additional toxins, and the ready-to-heat products are cooked inside the plastic containers, potentially releasing toxic chemicals,î Houlihan said.

While the report does list the names of the 105 brands tested, thatís not whatís important when choosing rice with the lowest levels of heavy metals, she added.

ìResults between brands didnít tend to vary,î Houlihan said. ìThe controlling factors for avoiding heavy metal levels seems to be the rice variety and the country of origin, not the brand of rice. So make sure you know where your rice comes from.

îUnfortunately, not all brands label the source of their product, so youíll have to do some shopping to find those that do,î she added.


This lack of clear package labeling is a gap that should be addressed by industry and the federal government, EWGís Stoiber said. ìStronger federal oversight and clearer labeling would go a long way to keep children safe from exposure to arsenic in food.î

The FDA takes the presence of heavy metals in food extremely seriously, said Andrew Nixon, director of communications for the US Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA.

ìUnder Secretary (Robert F.) Kennedy (Jr.)ís leadership, HHS is conducting a comprehensive review of chemicals in the food supply ó both those added intentionally and those like heavy metals that are environmental contaminants,î Nixon said in an email.

Additional ways to lower exposure
There is an easy way to eliminate nearly two-thirds of the arsenic in rice ó cook it like pasta. Using 6 to 10 cups of water for every cup of rice and draining the excess before eating can remove up to 60% of arsenic. However, only rinsing rice before cooking doesnít work, according to the report.

To further the amount of arsenic removed, soak rice for a half hour or overnight and drain before cooking as suggested.

Soaking rice overnight before cooking in extra water and draining can reduce arsenic levels significantly, experts say.

Keep in mind that boiling and draining will also remove some of the fortified iron added to rice. Iron is important for proper development and many babies are often deficient, the report said, so consult a pediatrician about adding iron-rich foods. Beans, eggs, fresh fruits and vegetables, lean red meat, and poultry are good sources.

In addition, there are nutrients such as B vitamins, calcium, zinc and vitamin C that can help ìreduce the bodyís absorption of contaminants or speed up their excretion,î the report said. ìFind them in foods like lean meat, yogurt, cheese, leafy greens, broccoli, beans and lentils, citrus fruits, strawberries, and peppers.î","May

Late abortions are rare. The US just lost a clinic that offered the procedure for over 50 years,"To fellow travelers, Hannah Brehm likely looked like she was taking a belated babymoon well into her third trimester.

But she and her husband had received a crushing diagnosis: Their babyís brain was not developing properly, upending their wanted pregnancy. Medical experts warned moving forward would likely mean her son would know only pain and suffering. The Minnesota couple wasnít going to take that chance.

Instead, they went to Colorado, where for decades the Boulder Abortion Clinic served as a resource for women who looked to terminate their pregnancies in the second or third trimester because of medical reasons, like Brehm, or other circumstances.

After more than 50 years, that clinic quietly closed last month, leaving the U.S. with just a handful that offer abortions after 28 weeks into pregnancy ó many on a case-by-case basis.

The 87-year-old clinic founder, Dr. Warren Hern, says he is deeply upset: ìIt became impossible to continue, but closing is one of the most painful decisions of my life.î


Anti-abortion advocates have celebrated the closure, calling it a step forward in protecting mothers and unborn children. While the overwhelming majority of abortions take place in the first trimester, former patients and reproductive rights advocates worry about the impact of losing an already narrow resource.

ìChances are itís not gonna happen to you. And I hope it doesnít happen to someone else that you love, but it is happening,î Brehm said, reflecting on her experience in 2022.

Reasons for late abortions
Federal data shows just 1% of abortions come after 21 weeks of pregnancy, but experts believe that number is higher because some states, including California, donít give the feds their abortion statistics.


The reasons for late abortions vary. Some diagnoses like anatomy abnormalities or genetic disorders canít happen until after 20 weeks or later into pregnancy. Other women may not find out theyíre pregnant until after the first trimester. Millions of women live in a state with a strict abortion ban.

Sarah Watkins traveled from Georgia to the Boulder clinic in 2019 just before 25 weeks into her pregnancy after learning her baby had a condition called trisomy 18, an extra chromosome that made it likely the baby would die in utero or shortly after birth. A genetic blood screening at 10 weeks previously dismissed chances of the condition, but a detailed ultrasound in the second trimester proved otherwise.

ìYou can do everything right, by the book, but you still canít find out certain things until that ultrasound at 20 weeks and sometimes even later,î she said. ìAnd as a mom, I did not want her to feel a single moment of hurt or suffering or pain or discomfort. Thatís why I made the decision.î

Watkins described the medical care she received at the Hernís clinic attentive and caring. Nevertheless, she said traveling to a place with multiple layers of bulletproof glass and a throng of protesters was a traumatic experience.

Hernís reach through the decades
For years, Hern was the only provider in the U.S. to offer later abortions, starting in 1973 and developing specialized techniques and even innovating certain tools to ensure better health outcomes. But offering abortions late in pregnancy came with risks.


He and his medical team received constant death threats. Someone shot through the windows of the clinic five times in 1988. Five of Hernís colleagues who offered similar services were assassinated throughout his career, including the 2009 slaying of Dr. George Tiller in Kansas.

When Hern announced the clinicís closure in late April, the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America declared the news as a ìVICTORYî in a social media post.

Hern said the work was always worth it. He recalled one of his first patients who couldnít believe the cleanliness of his operating room; she previously had an illegal abortion that left her humiliated and frightened.

ìShe looked up at me and said ëPlease, donít ever stop doing this,íî Hern said. ìSo I didnít. Until now.î


In the end, financial issues made it almost impossible to operate the clinic. Hern said patients increasingly were having trouble paying for the procedure, which hovers around $10,000 and is often not covered by insurance. Longtime personal donors were also dwindling.

Hern worked with physicians over the decades, hopeful that one day they would take over his clinic, but that never worked out.

ìI had to make a decision really, you know, sort of on the basis of the situation at the moment that we couldnít continue,î he said. ìIt was very, very painful. I see this as my personal failure.î

Providers and patients wonder whatís next
According to the Later Abortion Initiative by Ibis Reproductive Health, fewer than 20 clinics provide abortions after 24 weeks into pregnancy in the U.S. ó though that number isnít considered comprehensive and excludes hospitals and a handful of other clinics for security reasons.


Currently, the group lists three clinics ó in New Mexico, Maryland and Washington, D.C. ó that provide services after 28 weeks. Five others ó in Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Washington state ó will consider patients depending on physician recommendations or fetal and maternal conditions.

ìI think Dr. Hern has been the torchbearer for abortion leaders in pregnancy,î said Jane Armstrong, a licensed therapist in Texas who now helps support families who have terminated pregnancies for medical reasons. She ended her own pregnancy around 21 weeks in 2021.

ìWho will pick up the mantle? We really do need a new torchbearer right now.î

A dozen states have bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy and four more have bans that kick in after about six weeks. Abortion fund organizations, which help people arrange and pay abortions, say the bans mean a higher demand for later abortions. When people travel, it often takes more time to make appointments, gather the money needed and to catch a flight or take a drive hundreds of miles away.


ìEvery time a clinic closes, it does impact everybody and what kinds of care they give,î said Anna Rupani, executive director of Fund Texas Choice.

Shortly after the nationís highest court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, an all-trimester abortion clinic opened in Maryland ó a partnership between certified nurse-midwife Morgan Nuzzo and Dr. Diane Horvath, an OB-GYN who specializes in complex family planning.

They said theyíre worried about many things when it comes to reproductive rights, including the Trump administrationís move to curtail prosecutions against people accused of blocking access to abortion clinics and reproductive health centers. But theyíre also buoyed by the consistent overwhelming number of applications from providers whenever they post a position, and said that the number of clinics that offer later abortions has gone up since Roe was overturned.

ìThis type of care is still available,î Horvath said. ìItís more rare than it was a couple weeks ago, but we want to say loud and proud that our doors are still open and there are other places still open.î","May 13,2025",health,Associated Press,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/13/health/colorado-abortion-clinic-closure,,,,,,,,,,,,fellow travelers hannah brehm likely looked like taking belated

The†gift†of†life:†A†visual†history†of†organ†transplantation,"There were more than 48,000 organ transplants in the United States last year. Theyíre commonplace now, but the practice was considered experimental only a half-century ago.

Until just the past few years, transplants almost always involved human organs. Now, early experiments in xenotransplantation ó transplanting animal organs into humans ó are creating potential pathways to save lives.

Hereís a look back at how we got to this point.

Are animals the answer?
Pigs that have been genetically edited to make their organs more compatible with the human body are the latest frontier in organ transplantation.

Xenotransplantation, the practice of transplanting organs between species, is a concept that has been around for hundreds of years.

Early in the 20th century, Dr. Mathieu Jaboulay turned the idea into action with one of the first well-documented attempts to make an animal organ work for a human. In 1906 in Lyon, France, Jaboulay attached a pig kidney to a 48-year-old womanís elbow, choosing that spot because it was easy to access. Blood circulated through the kidney, and the kidney produced urine, something even some human donations in this period failed to do, studies show.


The pig kidney quickly failed, and the patient died soon after due to an infection.

ìThe lack of having ready access to human organs has always sort of been the holy grail, that you would have something in reserve that didnít require a human to die in order for another human to live,î said Dr. Jeffrey Stern, a senior member of the NYU Langone Transplant Instituteís xenotransplantation team. ìObviously, animals as that source is sort of an ideal version of that.î

The first successful human transplant

In 1954, the worldís first successful human organ transplant was performed by Dr. Joseph E. Murray at whatís now called Brigham and Womenís Hospital in Boston.

Murray took a kidney from 22-year-old Ronald Herrick and transplanted it into Richard Herrick, his twin brother. Because they were identical, Richardís immune system thought the new organ was its own, which prevented it from rejecting the foreign organ. Richard Herrick lived another eight years, and his organ donor brother had no harmful side effects.


ìI think that really moved the field,î said Dr. Stefan Tullius, chief of the Division of Transplant Surgery at Brigham and Womenís Hospital.

ìWhat that did show is that if you have the right combination and relationship between donor and recipient, then you indeed can transplant an organ and that is going to work,î Tullius added.

Since immunosuppressive drugs were not yet available, transplant experiments seemed to work only with twins whose immune systems thought the foreign organ were their own.

ìYou still ran into all those issues for the next 30 years with the immune system,î said Stern, who is also an assistant professor in the Department of Surgery at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. ìNot everyone has an identical twin.î

More donors

In the 1960s, Murray demonstrated in several experiments with dogs that an organ transplant would be more successful if the recipient received drugs to suppress the immune system after the procedure, to lower the chances of rejection.

In April 1962, in a world first that built on what he learned from those experiments, Murphy transplanted a kidney from a deceased donor into an unrelated human who was treated with an immunosuppressant called azathioprine. The patient survived more than a year, and s survival time lengthened even further when doctors discovered that an immunosuppressant worked better if given along with the steroid prednisone.


In June 1963, one of Murrayís research fellows, Belgian surgeon Dr. Guy Alexandre, performed the first transplant operation from a brain-dead donor, a controversial procedure at the time. Alexandre had been searching for a kidney for a patient with renal failure when a woman who had been in a car accident was brought in to his HÙpital Saint-Pierre in Brussels. Her heart was beating, but she showed no brain activity. Knowing that organs lost viability as soon as a patientís heart stopped, Alexandre got permission from his department chair to transplant the womanís kidney into his patient with renal failure. The recipient lived another 87 days.

Over the next couple of years, Alexandre secretly performed other kidney transplants using brain-dead donors to see if such an approach would lengthen survival time compared with transplants from donors whose hearts had stopped. He disclosed the experiments at a medical conference a couple years later, to mixed reactions.

It wasnít until 1968 that a Harvard Medical School committee published its recommendation that irreversible loss of brain function ñ once called ìirreversible comaî ñ would be a new criterion for death. Afterward, transplants involving brain-dead donors became more common, vastly expanding the pool of available organs.

ìTo come up with the definition of brain death as an alternative to cardiac death ñ so the discontinuation of circulation ñ was huge, because it allowed the procurement of organs,î Tullius said.

Trial and error

Transplant doctors started experimenting with kidneys because humans have two and can survive with only one. Patients also had the option of dialysis if the transplant failed. But the more the doctors learned, the more confident they became that they could transplant other organs.

By the late 1960s, they started to experiment with livers and pancreases, and in 1967, South African surgeon Dr. Christiaan Barnard of Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town performed the first heart transplant. He transplanted a 25-year-oldís heart into a 53-year-old grocer who was dying from chronic heart disease. The grocer died 18 days later from a lung infection, but the heart continued to beat until his death.


Barnardís second heart transplant patient lived almost 19 months. His fifth and sixth patients lived for almost 13 and 24 years, respectively.

By the 1990s, immunosuppressants like cyclosporine and tacrolimus opened new possibilities for transplants of multiple tissues. In 1998, Dr. Jean-Michel Dubernard did the first surgical hand transplant in Lyon, France. In 2005, he and Dr. Bernard Devauchelle performed the first partial face transplant for Isabelle Dinoire, a woman who lost part of her face in a dog attack. In 2010, a Spanish team led by Dr. Juan Barret performed the first full-face transplant.

ìThereís the first 30 years of transplantation that everything was sort of experimental, right?î Stern said. ìIt wasnít a commonplace endeavor that we do what we currently do, and it was a lot of trial and error and survival, and sort of the entire field of transplantation, I think, was very tenuous in that. It was adaptation and invention of new technologies that allowed transplantation to become commonplace.î

Baby Fae

In 1984, Dr. Leonard Bailey tried to save the life of Stephanie Fae Beauclair at Loma Linda University in California. The child, who became known as Baby Fae, was born with a deadly heart condition, and Bailey, who had been experimenting with cross-species transplants in animals, got permission to transplant a baboon heart. Stephanie lived just 21 more days, but the case generated more awareness about the need for infant organ donations and the possibility of cross-species transplantation.

Eventually, scientists decided that primates, although evolutionarily the closest cousin to humans, werenít the best organ donors.


ìPrimates turned out to be too small, too expensive and too controversial,î said medical ethicist Dr. Art Caplan, who works with transplant cases at NYU. There was also a concern about infection. Non-human primates may carry a variety of pathogens that are not harmful to them but that can cause disease in humans, including Marburg virus and HIV.

Eventually, scientists realized that pigs would be a better option: Theyíre anatomically similar to humans, they breed quickly, and there was a reduced risk of zoonotic disease.

Nobel-winning technology
Scientists at United Therapeutics genetically modify a pig cell CNN
Research in xenotransplantation stalled until the development of the gene editing tool CRISPR in the early 2000s. This Nobel-winning technology gave scientists the ability to edit the pig genome to make it more compatible with humansí, including knocking out key sequences in pig DNA that would result in almost automatic organ rejection in people. Combining that with cloning techniques gave scientists a chance to maintain consistent genetics and produce universal pig donors.


ìCloning and to apply CRISPR, to have the opportunity of gene editing, is really allowing not only transplantation but is also relevant for other areas of medicine,î Tullius said. ìI would put those in the revolutionary category.î

One step closer

Pig organs had been transplanted into non-human primates, but the real test came in September 2021, when a genetically engineered pig kidney was transplanted to a brain-dead patient at NYU Langone.

The kidney was attached to the blood vessels in the recipientís upper leg, outside the abdomen, for 54 hours while doctors studied how well it functioned. The organ seemed to function as well as a human kidney transplant, and the doctors did not see any signs of rejection.


ìWe learned more from that than anything else that weíve done,î Dr. Robert Montgomery, one of the surgeons who performed the procedure, told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. ìIt was really the basis of how we were able to figure out how to treat rejection in our living patients.î

ìThe family graciously approved donation of their loved oneís body for this procedure. That extraordinary generosity paved the way for this major step forward in creating a sustainable supply of life-saving organs and hopefully ending the current paradigm that someone has to die for someone to live,î Montgomery said in a news release at the time.

Making history
Surgeons at the University of Maryland Medical Center prepare the pig heart to be transplanted into David Bennett University of Maryland Medical Center
On January 7, 2022, surgeons at the University of Maryland School of Medicine performed the first xenotransplant into a living person.


David Bennett, 57, could not walk and relied on an artificial lung and heart bypass machine to stay alive. He was too sick to qualify for a human heart but was able to undergo the experimental procedure under the US Food and Drug Administrationís compassionate use pathway, which allows patients with no other alternatives to try experimental treatments.

He lived two additional months, having the chance to spend more time with his family and watch the Super Bowl.

ìAs with any first-in-the-world transplant surgery, this one led to valuable insights that will hopefully inform transplant surgeons to improve outcomes and potentially provide lifesaving benefits to future patients,î said his surgeon, Dr. Bartley Griffith.

Bennett was the first of a handful of compassionate use xenotransplant patients. But as researchers approach clinical trials, they hope they will have a better understanding of how successful the organs can be under more typical circumstances.


ìThe promise of xenotransplantation is the promise of hope for our patients. A hope for the future that for too long has been uncertain. It is hope turned to possibility turned to reality. Our patients can dream again about graduations, weddings Ö about life. Hope should not have to be rationed,î said Dr. Jayme Locke, a professor of surgery at NYU Langone.

Custom organs

ìMultiple shots on goalî is how geneticist Dr. David Ayares describes United Therapeuticsí approach to the future of organ transplantation.


This summer, the company will embark on the first FDA clinical trial of xenotransplantation.

ìSo instead of one-off compassionate use transplants that were very valuable in learning how to optimize and extend the survival of these patients, now we can go into a multicenter trial,î Ayares, president and chief scientific officer of Revivicor, a United Therapeutics subsidiary, told Gupta.

But that still wonít be enough to solve the organ shortage completely, so United Therapeutics and others in the transplant community are continuing to think farther into the future. ìI think the next thing weíre going to do is Ö create personalized organs where we donít have to use any immunosuppression,î Montgomery said of what he expects down the road.

This could mean using a pigís organ as scaffolding where scientists could seed human stem cells, or even 3D-printing organs.

ìThen you have a designer organ for that person when they need it,î Montgomery said.","May

"Dr.†Sanjay†Gupta:†At†the†forefront†of†organ†transplants,†patients†are†the†pioneers","The story of transplants has always been one of altruism. After all, organs can be neither sold nor purchased. They can only be donated as a gift of life.

It is a story that started in 1954, when Dr. Joseph Murray performed the worldís first successful organ transplant at Bostonís Peter Bent Brigham Hospital between identical twin brothers Ronald and Richard Herrick. Richard had been discharged from the US Coast Guard after being diagnosed with end-stage kidney disease, and his identical twin brother, Ronald, was a willing donor. Although they had no certainty it would work, the transplant resulted in eight more years of life for Richard, successful in part because they had the same DNA.

When Ronald died in 2010, Dr. Murray remembered him in a statement published in the American Journal of Transplantation, saying: ìwe should never forget that he not only saved his brother Richardís life, but also paved the way for thousands of other transplant recipients throughout the world.î

It is this same ethos that is now pushing forward the burgeoning field of xenotransplantation ñ the practice of using animal organs for human transplant.

For the past two years, Iíve spoken with surgeons, genetic engineers and patients who have all told me of the hope of using genetically engineered pig donors to help end the organ shortage crisis. In the United States alone, there are more than 100,000 people waiting for an organ at any given moment ñ most of them in need of a kidney. Every day, 17 people on that list will die, just waiting.

He was tired of just surviving. A pig kidney gave him a shot at living

ìThis paradigm that someone has to die in order for somebody to live is, a broken paradigm. It just doesnít work,î said Dr. Robert Montgomery, director of the NYU Langone Transplant Institute. As both a transplant surgeon and a heart transplant recipient himself, he knows how agonizing the wait can be. Itís why heís relentlessly pushing for a new source of organs.


ìBecause less than 1% of the people who die every year die in a way that they could ever even be considered as organ donors, we need a sustainable, renewable source of organs from something else other than humans dying,î Dr. Montgomery told me.

In many ways, the idea of using pigs is not all that far-fetched. After all, we have been using pig heart valves to replace human valves since the 1970s. The drugs heparin and insulin were initially derived from pigs. Because of their similarity in size to humans, a pigís organs are a pretty good match for us. And our long history of breeding them and their ability to produce large litters in just under four months makes them a reliable, steady and speedy source of potential organs.

It was the more recent development of CRISPR and genetic engineering that has truly accelerated the field of xenotransplantation. Scientists can now modify a pigís DNA so that its organs are more compatible for human transplant, controlling for rejection, growth and possible viruses.


But just as with the Herrick brothers, all of this heady science requires pioneering patients willing to take the chance and raise their hands despite the unknowns.

In January, surgeons from Mass General successfully transplanted a genetically modified pig kidney into Tim Andrews of Concord, New Hampshire.

Sixty-six-year-old Tim Andrews had been on dialysis for two years. He had end-stage kidney disease, and the likelihood that he would get a transplant was extremely low in part because of his rare blood type. Doctors put the chances of him finding a match within the next five years at just 9%. The likelihood of him dropping off the list altogether in that same time period because of illness or death was nearly 50%.

Dialysis had worn on Tim so much that he had resigned himself to the idea that he might literally die in the dialysis chair.


For those not on dialysis, it can be hard to understand just how grueling it can be, both mentally and physically. But think of it like this: Our kidneys are always working, filtering blood 24/7. A dialysis machine tries to do all that work, but compresses it into three or four days a week, a few hours each time. It was so stressful on Timís body that he had a heart attack six months after starting dialysis.

When he learned that his hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, had performed the first experimental pig kidney xenotransplant, he told his doctor, Dr. Leonard Riella, that he had to be given a chance.

Even though he knew there was tremendous uncertainty about the outcome of the transplant, Tim pushed forward. When I visited Tim and his wife, Karen, at their home in Concord, New Hampshire, he told me, ìIt may shorten your life, but youíre going to do something for humanity. And Iím like, oh, God, thatís what itís all about.î

At the time, 53-year-old Towana Looney was the only person in the world who could understand what Tim was contemplating. Twenty-five years earlier, Towana had donated one of her kidneys to her mom, but two years later, she developed pre-eclampsia during pregnancy, and her remaining kidney was damaged. Like Tim, she was unlikely to find a match anytime soon, in her case because of high antibodies. She had been on grueling dialysis for eight years before undergoing the transplant in November 2024 at NYU Langone. Dr. Montgomery was her transplant surgeon. Her life was transformed, and when I saw this vibrant womaen on stage talking about her experience, I was amazed at how healthy she looked. Afterward, Dr. Montgomery told me, ìShe wants to start a revolution.î

In April of this year, Towana had to have her kidney removed after she developed an infection unrelated to the organ that required her immunosuppression regimen to be lowered. At the time, she had lived with the genetically modified pig organ for 130 days, the longest period of time ever recorded.


In a statement, Towana said, ìIím so grateful to have been given the opportunity to be part of this incredible research. For the first time since 2016, I enjoyed time with friends and family without planning around dialysis treatments. Though the outcome is not what anyone wanted, I know a lot was learned from my 130 days with a pig kidneyóand that this can help and inspire many others in their journey to overcome kidney disease.î

These are still early days, and so there will be ups and downs, but in science, like life, you learn just as much from the failures as the successes. Each step forward has been building on the lessons learned from previous patient pioneers, like David Bennett and Lawrence Faucette. They both received pig hearts and lived an additional six to eight weeks. Rick Slayman and Lisa Pisano received pig kidneys in 2024, and both lived about two additional months after their procedures. In each case, their stories taught scientists valuable and transformative lessons about the field of xenotransplantation.

This spring, I had a chance to visit with Brittany Rydel, Lisa Pisanoís daughter. She told me, ìMy mom always cared about other people. And one of the first things she said to me was, ëEven if this doesnít work for me, it can work for someone else.í And I think about that a lot. You know, I might need a kidney one day. My kids might need a kidney one day. ì

Lisa Pisano, 54, faced heart failure and was on dialysis to manage end-stage kidney disease. At NYU Langone in 2024, she became the second living person to receive a pig kidney. The organ was removed after 47 days.

The baton of altruism and hope passed on again.

So often, it is the scientists and the researchers who are recognized ñ and for good reason. After all, the story of xenotransplantation is possible because of several Nobel Prize-winning discoveries, including transplanation, gene editing, cloning, IVF and immunology. As Dr. Montgomery told me, ìWe stand on the shoulders of giants for sure.î

He†was†tired†of†just†surviving.†A†pig†kidney†gave†him†a†shot†at†living,"Tim Andrews knew that he needed dialysis to manage his end-stage kidney disease, but over months of treatment, he started to wonder whether it was worth it. He was exhausted and hopeless. He missed his grandkids.

It kept him alive, but it didnít feel like living.

Desperate for another option, he found a surprising alternative: an organ from a pig.

Andrews, 67, is a pioneer of a new kind of medicine. In January, he had an experimental cross-species transplant of a kidney from a genetically modified pig. He is one of only a handful of patients who have undergone the experimental procedure. For now, heís the lone person in the United States known to be living with a pig kidney.

Andrews knew that there was a risk to trying something so new, but if the kidney gave him just one more day free from dialysis, it was worth it ó for him and for fellow patients.


ìThis will do something for humanity,î Andrews said.

ëPick a boxí
Andrews had been living with diabetes since the 1990s, managing the condition with insulin. About 2Ω years ago, he went to the doctor feeling unusually tired. Tests showed that he had stage 3 kidney failure ó his kidneys were still working but less efficiently than they should. He was relieved to learn that it was manageable with medication, monitoring and lifestyle changes.

But about a month later, a doctor delivered more bad news: Andrewsí kidney disease had rapidly progressed to end-stage disease. Dialysis was the only option to keep him alive until he could get an organ transplant.


Dialysis is highly effective at cleaning the blood, but it places a ìhuge burdenî on the body, Andrewsí doctors told CNN. At first, Andrews thought it was going well. But about six months in, he had a heart attack.

ìIt takes a toll on you, emotionally and physically,î said Andrews, who lives in New Hampshire.

Experimental transplants with organs from gene-edited pigs see major steps forward

He was tempted to forgo dialysis entirely until a doctor warned that if he did so, he should ìpick a box.î With the state his kidneys were in, his body would be in it within a couple months.


For six hours, three days a week, he kept at it. On days off, heíd sleep. By the time he woke up, heíd have to start the process all over again.

When he thinks about his experience with dialysis, Andrews appreciates what the doctors and nurses did to keep him alive. But when he kept having to sit in that oversized green chair hooked up to the dialysis machine, the whole situation hurt his spirit, too.

He was too tired to walk or get groceries. He couldnít eat. Even in the few hours he felt OK, his immune system was so weak that he had to avoid crowds. Dialysis meant no more Red Sox games, no more fun with grandchildren, no more travel.

Tim Andrews takes Dr. Sanjay Gupta to his former dialysis center.

As the hours ticked past, he couldnít think about gratitude. All he could think about was death.

The dialysis side effects got so bad that he wanted to quit, but his wife, Karen, wouldnít let him. He also kept hearing his fatherís voice in his mind, telling him to stop complaining and start doing something about his situation.

ëI know what end-stage meansí
Andrews learned that his odds of getting a human kidney donation were not good.


Nearly 90,0000 people are on the waiting list for a kidney in the US. Most donít get a transplant because they become too sick or die while waiting for a match.

Andrewsí chances were slimmer than most because of his rare blood type. People typically wait about three to five years for a donor kidney. For him, it would likely be seven to 10 years. Doctors thought his body could take only five years of dialysis.

ìI was a little short there,î Andrews said. ìI know what end-stage means.î

But his research gave him hope. Massachusetts General Hospital was also investigating animal alternatives. He demanded that the hospital liaison put him in touch with one of the doctors from that project: Dr. Leonardo Riella, medical director of kidney transplantation at Mass General.


When they first met, Andrews was ìvery frail,î Riella said. He arrived in a wheelchair. But when Riella mentioned whatís known as xenotransplantation ó transplants using genetically modified pig organs ó Andrewsí eyes ìsparked.î

ìHe said ëTell me what I need to do.í î

Riella told Andrews heíd need to get a lot stronger if he wanted a transplant of any kind.

ìThey said, ëPrepare your body for battle,í î Andrewsí wife, Karen, remembered.


For the next few months, Andrews went to the gym and physical therapy, got his teeth fixed, got several vaccines and lost 22 pounds.


When he went back to the clinic a few months later, Riella said, Andrews was ìalmost running around the room.î

He talked to people about the procedure. He prayed. His wife, Karen, also had to agree: If they got the green light, she would need to sign consent papers. On the slim chance he got a virus from the organ, sheíd be exposed to it, too.

ìI was a little taken aback by that,î Karen said. But she didnít have any doubt that this transplant, though unusual, was the right way to go.

ìIt has to be better than dialysis,î she said. ìHe was just feeling so awful all the time.î

A new birthday
In January, it was finally time.


On surgery day, his family hugged and kissed him good-bye. Karen gave him a high-five and wished him luck.

The procedure was supposed to take four hours, but only about two hours and 15 minutes in, Karen said, her phone rang. The doctors were done early and said it went ìunbelievably well.î

A team of doctors told Karen that they had successfully attached the genetically modified pig kidney alongside Andrewsí nonfunctioning organ.


ìThey put the kidney on the table and started connecting him to the kidney, and he actually peed across the room,î Karen said, laughing. Everyone in the operating room started cheering.

ìOf course, I started bawling like a baby,î Karen said.

It all happened so fast that even the doctors who did the surgery were surprised.

ìIt worked right away, and the numbers started getting better,î Riella said.


After waking up from surgery, Andrews felt ìreenergized and revitalized.î

ìI was alive, and I hadnít been in a long time,î he said.

He hopped off the bed and tap-danced across the room, he said. His mind felt clear.

ìIt was a miracle,î Andrews said. So much so, he declared that he had a new birthday.


ìI said ëlook at me, itís like Iím like a new man,í î he said. ìItís like new birth. I said, ëIíve got a new birthday. 1/25/25 is my new birthday.í î

ëNow I can do anything I wantí
After the transplant, Andrews spent a week in the hospital but only out of an abundance of caution.

In the months since, heís had a few ìsmall bumps in the road,î including a three-week hospital stay. But the pig kidney does what a kidney from a living human donor would do.

Life is returning to normal. Andrews cooks, vacuums and takes long walks with his dog, Cupcake.

He currently takes more than 50 pills every day as the doctors try to figure out the type of medications heíll need with his new kidney. But living without dialysis has made such a difference.

ìBasically, I was just sleeping, sick all the time. Now I can do anything I want,î Andrews said.

He even lets himself picture a future. He canít wait to see his grandkids again.

ìThey saw me at the lowest, and now theyíll be able to see me alive and laughing and carrying on like Grandpa does,î Andrews said.

If all goes well, he hopes to take Karen to Europe in a year. He said theyíve put it off far too long.

ëItís a learning curveí
Still, Andrews knows that the pig kidney may not work long-term. Heís still on the wait list for a human organ. If the pig kidney can act as a bridge that keeps him healthy enough to wait for a match from a human donor, that would be a medical first ó and a success.

Andrews is the fourth living patient in the US to get a genetically modified pig kidney transplant, and he wonít be the last. In addition to the ongoing trial at Mass General in conjunction with biotech firm eGenesis, United Therapeutics Corp ñ the other main biotech company helping create the pig kidneys ñ announced in February that it would be allowed to start its own clinical trials with New York University.

In March 2024, Richard Slayman became the first living patient in the world to get a genetically modified pig kidney. The operation at Mass General went well, but he died two months later from causes not related to the transplant.

Doctors said they learned a lot from their experience with Slayman. He had scarring on his heart after eight years of dialysis, Riella said, and itís probably important to get patients like Andrews, who havenít needed dialysis as long.

In April 2024, Lisa Pisano became the first person to receive a mechanical heart pump as well as a gene-edited pig kidney. The organ failed due to limited blood flow and was removed the next month. She died in July 2024.

Then, in November 2024, NYU transplanted 53-year-old Towana Looney with a genetically modified pig kidney. It functioned for four months and nine days, the longest yet, but doctors had to remove it in April when her immune system started to reject it.

Figuring out how to manage rejection is going to be key, doctors say. The pig kidneys Andrews and Slayman got had 69 genomic edits, while Looneyís had fewer. Doctors say they still donít know how many edits are necessary, but both versions of the modified pig kidneys had pig genes removed and human genes added to make the organ more compatible with the human body.

Patients also receive anti-rejection drugs and wearable remote monitoring tools. But doctors still are figuring out how much medicine and monitoring is needed.

ìIt is a learning curve,î Riella said.

Riella is hopeful xenotransplantation may one day solve the worldís organ shortage.

ìI think patients like Tim will be remembered as heroes,î he said. ìWithout them willing to take the risk, we wouldnít be able to move this to the clinic.î

Andrews remembers what it felt like to have to make the choice. But he also remembers what it was like to sit for hours at the dialysis center.

ìItís hard to come to terms with mortality. You think ëah, I can handle thatí and everything, but itís tough,î he said recently, back in the green chair where he underwent dialysis. ìIt was very tough to realize that was it.

ìI was going to die in this building.î

He found a way out. He hopes his story will inspire others to look for hope, too.

ìI see way too many people give up,î Andrews said. ìDonít give up.î

FDA†greenlights†first†blood†test†to†help†diagnose†Alzheimer's†disease†in†the†US,"The US Food and Drug Administration has given marketing clearance to a blood test to help diagnose Alzheimerís disease, making the test the first to get signoff to aid in the early detection of the disease in the United States.

The test, called the Lumipulse G pTau217/ﬂ-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio, is for adults 55 and older who are showing signs and symptoms of Alzheimerís disease, the FDA announced Friday.

It works by measuring two proteins in blood plasma: pTau217 and beta-amyloid 1-42. A ratio of those proteins tends to correlate with the occurrence or absence of amyloid plaques in the brain, which are among the hallmarks of Alzheimerís disease. The test does not measure amyloid directly but can signal its presence.

A new potential Alzheimerís test can find symptoms before they begin to show

However, there remains no current single test to diagnose Alzheimerís disease. Doctors primarily rely on a variety of tools to diagnose the condition, which may include medical history, neurological exams, cognitive and functional evaluations, brain imaging, spinal fluid analysis and, more recently, blood tests.


The FDA said the results of the newly cleared blood test must be assessed in conjunction with other clinical information from a patient.

ìAlzheimerís disease impacts too many people, more than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined,î FDA Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary said in Fridayís announcement. ìKnowing that 10% of people aged 65 and older have Alzheimerís, and that by 2050 that number is expected to double, I am hopeful that new medical products such as this one will help patients.î

According to the FDA, the new blood test ñ developed by the Pennsylvania-based biotechnology company Fujirebio Diagnostics Inc. ñ can help increase access to Alzheimerís disease detection and reduce reliance on positron emission tomography or PET scans, a type of imaging that can reveal amyloid plaques in the brain but can be expensive, costing thousands of dollars without insurance.


The FDA said it reviewed clinical trial data on the new blood test, involving plasma samples collected from 499 adults who were cognitively impaired. The samples were evaluated using the blood test, and the results were compared with the results from patientsí PET scans or separate testing using cerebrospinal fluid samples, such as from spinal taps.

The data showed that 91.7% of adults with positive results using the blood test had the presence of amyloid plaques confirmed by their PET scan or cerebrospinal fluid test, and 97.3% of people with negative results had a negative amyloid PET scan or cerebrospinal fluid test result, according to the FDA.

The agency added that the risks associated with the blood test are mainly the risk of a false positive or false negative test result.

A ënew eraí of Alzheimerís research
Preventive neurologist Dr. Richard Isaacson, who established one of the first Alzheimerís prevention clinics in the United States, said he has been using this blood test for years for research and applauded the FDA clearance.


ìIt can provide better clarity into whether a person experiencing memory loss may have Alzheimerís disease. They can take this test as a screening test,î said Isaacson, director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida. Compared with costly PET scans or spinal taps, ìthis is a much more simple screening test, with reasonable accuracy, to tell the physician that a person with cognitive decline has symptoms that are actually due to Alzheimerís disease.î

But Isaacson warned that while the FDA clearance is ìan important step forwardî for the field, more research is needed to help inform how blood test results should be interpreted and used to make clinical decisions.

ìI think the next step as a field is, we need to advance education about what these tests mean and what they donít and who they should be used for,î he said. ìBecause they mean different things in different people depending on their risk factors and whether or not they have symptoms. So weíre still early.î

Fujirebio Diagnostics designed the blood test to help detect Alzheimerís disease early, when interventions are more effective, president and CEO Monte Wiltse said in a news release last year, when the company filed its test with the FDA.


ìAn early and accurate diagnosis will also facilitate the development of new drug therapies, which are urgently needed as the prevalence of AD increases with a rapidly aging population globally,î Wiltse said.

Itís estimated that more than 2 in 5 people over the age of 55 in the United States ñ about 42% ñ will develop dementia in their later years.

But in some cases, deposits of amyloid can start to accumulate in the brain decades before Alzheimerís symptoms begin. Early detection of these amyloid plaques could open the door for a person to take steps to slow the progression of disease, such as starting preventive treatment with medications.

ìFor too long Americans have struggled to get a simple and accurate diagnosis, with todayís action by the FDA we are hopeful it will be easier for more individuals to receive an accurate diagnosis earlier,î Dr. Maria Carrillo, chief science officer and medical affairs lead at the Alzheimerís Association, said in a statement Friday.

ëAmazingí reduction in Alzheimerís risk verified by blood markers, study says

There are a variety of laboratory-developed tests on the market that can be used to detect blood-based biomarkers associated with Alzheimerís, according to the Alzheimerís Association, as well as experimental tests. But the Fujirebio Diagnostics test is the first one cleared by the FDA.


ìBlood-based biomarkers are reshaping how we identify and understand Alzheimerís disease,î Carrillo said. ìAt the same time, there are important questions for health care professionals to consider; in particular, who should be tested and when.î

For now, the FDAís clearance ìmarks a major milestone,î said Dr. Howard Fillit, co-founder and chief science officer at the Alzheimerís Drug Discovery Foundation.

ìThe ability to diagnose Alzheimerís earlier with a simple blood test, like we do for cholesterol, is a game changer, allowing more patients to receive treatment options that have the potential to significantly slow or even prevent the disease,î Fillit said in an email Friday. ìThis is a clear example of the new era of Alzheimerís research where innovation, science and technology come together

"After†NIH†staffing†cuts,†cancer†patient†in†clinical†trial†worries†she†may†lose†crucial†time","With the future of her cancer treatment in limbo, Natalie Phelps doesnít know how much longer she can wait.

Last month, after months of seeking treatment options for her colorectal cancer, the 43-year-old mother of two was accepted into an ongoing study at the National Institutes of Health. She thought the research would allow her to receive an experimental immunotherapy ñ but she now faces an excruciating wait and an equally excruciating choice.

First, her tumor must grow to at least 1 centimeter in size in order to receive treatment, she said. But even after she meets that criteria, an abrupt reduction in the NIH workforce means her treatment will take much longer to develop than initially expected. Sheís worried that that extra time may make a huge difference in her health.

The Trump administration has been conducting a review of funding and a restructuring of the US Department of Health and Human Services, resulting in massive waves of job cuts across federal health agencies under HHS, including the NIH, the nationís medical research agency.

Immunotherapy helps certain cancer patients avoid surgery: ëWe hope this is the futureí

Part of the HHS transformation involves decreasing the NIH workforce by about 1,200 ìby centralizing procurement, human resources, and communications across its 27 institutes and centers,î according to the Trump administration. The administration announced in late March that the HHS restructuring would save taxpayers $1.8 billion per year through an overall reduction of about 10,000 full-time employees.


Phelps said that some of the scientists working on her NIH trial were among the cuts.

Phelps was diagnosed with stage IV colorectal cancer in 2020, at age 38. She was nearly eight months pregnant at the time and originally thought her symptoms ñ abdominal pain, irregular bowel movements and mucus in her stool ñ were probably due to pregnancy or hemorrhoids. But as her symptoms worsened, she had a colonoscopy that found a tumor in her rectum. Further testing confirmed that it was cancer and that it had spread to her liver.

Phelps has had surgery to remove the initial tumor, radiation therapy, three liver surgeries and 48 rounds of chemotherapy. Yet the cancer has continued to spread, she said, which is why she has been eager to try immunotherapy through the NIH trial ñ and is worried about the wait.

Trial delay ëcould cost them their lifeí
Immunotherapy is a form of cancer treatment that harnesses a personís own immune cells to target and fight the disease. The NIH trial specifically involves a T-cell receptor-based therapy in which Phelpsí immune cells were collected through a blood draw, she said. Once her tumor grows to meet the criteria, the cells will be engineered to target her cancer, she said.


But the time it may take to engineer the cells for that next step has expanded from four to eight weeks because there are not as many researchers working on the trial as before the NIH staff cuts, Phelps said.

ìSo hereís the tricky part: Should I continue staying off chemo and hope a tumor grows to meet the 1-centimeter threshold, or give up on clinical trials for now?î Phelps said. Giving up on the trials would mean a return to traditional chemotherapy and radiation to treat her cancer.

She was told that the NIH team will work to engineer her cells at a faster rate than others in the trial so it wonít take eight weeks, but the process will still take weeks.

Overall, ìgoing from four to eight weeks is a huge deal for people with metastatic cancer,î Phelps said, adding that it could lead to further complications or even be life-threatening.


ìJust to give you a personal example, at the end of March, my scan showed I had disease that was stable, and my blood work showed that my tumor antigens were coming down. It was at a number of 43 for something called a CEA,î Phelps said. This carcinoembryonic antigen test measures levels of the CEA protein in the blood, as certain cancers like colorectal may cause high levels.

ìOne month later, my disease had spread to my bones, all of my lymph nodes, and my CEA marker was 203. Thatís in one month, in four weeks,î she said. ìFor some patients, it might not be a huge deal. For other patients, like me, it is, and it could cost them their life.î

The reductions in NIH funding and staff are happening at a time when colorectal cancer cases have been rising among younger adults. A report released in 2023 by the American Cancer Society said that the proportion of colorectal cancer cases among adults younger than 55 increased from 11% in 1995 to 20% in 2019.

ìThe rates of cancer amongst people younger than 50 are on the rise, and they tend to be aggressive and later-stage cancers,î Phelps said. ìSo it makes zero sense, if you care about keeping America healthy, to reduce your medical research at a time when you have cancer rates rising in your younger population that are the ones working and driving the economy.î


Phelps added that if she could wave a magic wand, she would wish for ìall the cancer research to be restored to where it was before this administration started.î

ëYou donít care about Natalieí
US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was asked at a Senate committee hearing Wednesday about NIH staff cuts and Phelpsí case specifically.

Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, said during the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing that Phelpsí ìbest hopeî is the NIH clinical trial.


Kennedy said that if Murray contacts his office, he can help.

ìI donít think that should happen to anybody,î Kennedy said of Phelpsí case.

ìWell, what have you ñ and I mean you personally ñ done to assess how those staff cuts are impacting patient care? She is one of many,î Murray asked.

ìI provided the guidelines that said no clinical trials should be affected by the cuts,î Kennedy responded.


ìMr. Secretary, I just have a short amount of time ñ they are impacting clinical trials,î Murray interrupted.

ìYou asked me the question. Do you want me to answer it?î Kennedy retorted.

Their heated exchange continued.


ìI offered to help her, but you donít care. You donít care about Natalie,î Kennedy said. ìIíve offered to help Natalie.î

Murray then pressed him about proposed cuts at the NIH.

ìI think the cuts that are now proposed by NIH are going to hurt,î Kennedy said. ìThereís no agency head in the government, like myself, that wants to see their budget cut.î

Murray asked for a personal update on Phelpsí case from Kennedyís office in the next 24 hours, as well as details about the state of NIH clinical care.


Later in the hearing, Kennedy said that his team had identified Phelpsí case and that she has not met the criteria to receive treatment in the trial.

ìIt had nothing to doî with the reduction in force at the NIH, he said. ìNone of our clinical trials were shut down because of the RIF. That was a canard.î

Murray later responded that she spoke with Phelps directly and that it was her doctor at the NIH who told Phelps that staffing cuts were having an impact.

ìThe issue, as I stated clearly, was the delay in care,î Murray said. ìMy staff has put in inquiries with HHS leadership, and theyíve been unresponsive so far. And just to make it clear, this is just one case of many.î

Federal health overhaul
HHS ìremains committedî to advancing cancer research, spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in an email.


ìHHS deeply values cancer research and remains committed to advancing life-saving scientific studies that improve patient care and outcomes to Make America Healthy Again,î he said.

When plans for the restructuring of HHS were announced in late March, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. described them as an effort to allow the department to do more at a lower cost to taxpayers.

ìThis overhaul will be a win-win for taxpayers and for those that HHS serves,î he said.

Trump administration cut $2.7 billion in NIH research funding through March, Senate committee minority report says

A new Senate HELP Committee minority staff report, released Tuesday and authored by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, found that the Trump administration cut $2.7 billion in NIH research funding in the first three months of this year ñ including a 31% reduction in cancer research funding from January through March compared with the same timeframe last year.


In a post on X in response, HHS called Sandersí report ìunequivocally falseî and ìa politically motivated distortion that undermines the thousands of dedicated public health professionals across HHS, who remain steadfast in their commitment to delivering results for the American people.î The post added that HHS is ìstreamlining programs, eliminating redundancies, and ñ above all else ñ prioritizing gold standard science.î

Itís estimated that at least 1 in 5 people with cancer in the US participate in some form of medical research.

ìClinical trials are a key part of delivery of care to patients. At a large academic center, such as all the large cancer centers, clinical trials are deeply ingrained into patient care ñ and without clinical trials, advances in delivery of care to patients will not be made. Itís only through clinical trials that high-quality data about new treatments and cures can be developed,î said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, who has been following the changes at the NIH.

ìI can also say that terminating multiyear research projects midway leads to a lot of waste of taxpayersí dollars, because there has already been substantial investment in a project,î he said. ìSo if you end a study when itís halfway done or three-quarters of the way done, then thereís no benefit to either science or to patients after there has already been substantial investment.î","May

Florida†becomes†second†state†in†US†to†ban†fluoride†in†public†drinking†water,"Florida has become the second state in the nation to ban the addition of fluoride to public drinking water.

On Thursday, Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the Florida Farm Bill, which includes language banning the use of any additive in a public water system that does not meet the new definition of a ìwater quality additiveî: a chemical or substance used in public water to specifically address drinking water standards, contaminants or quality.

ìYes, use fluoride for your teeth, thatís fine. But forcing it into the water supply is basically forced medication on people,î DeSantis said. ìThey donít have a choice. Youíre taking that away from them.î

More than 70% of Floridians who use community water systems receive fluoridated water, according to Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, who issued guidance in November recommending against community water fluoridation, citing its potential health effects.

What to know about fluoride in drinking water

Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral thatís found in soil, rocks and water to varying degrees. It is also a byproduct of fertilizer production. On the recommendation of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, many cities have added fluoride to their treated drinking water for decades to help protect teeth from cavities.


The CDC reiterated its faith in the health benefits of fluoride in 2015, naming water fluoridation one of the ì10 Greatest Public Health Achievements of the 21st Century.î The ADA has also emphasized that ìeighty years of community water fluoridation at optimal levels has proven to be safe and effective at reducing tooth decay to improve oral health.î

However, research has showed that exposure to fluoridated water during pregnancy is associated with increased neurobehavioral problems in children, and a federal review concluded that higher levels are linked with lower IQ in kids.

Utahís ban on fluoride in public water is a simple change that raises complicated new health risks, experts say


US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pledged to roll back CDC recommendations that fluoride be added to municipal drinking water and has promised that a panel of experts will review the guidelines and make new recommendations.


Kennedy canít formally prevent communities from adding fluoride to their drinking water, but some states and cities have followed his lead. In March, Utah became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water.

The US Food and Drug Administration also said this week it is starting the process to remove prescription fluoride tablets and drops from the market. Theyíre typically prescribed for babies and children who are at high risk of tooth decay because they drink water that doesnít contain added fluoride.","May 16,2025",Health,Katherine†Dillinger,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/15/health/florida-fluoride-ban,,,,,,,,,,,,florida become second state nation ban addition fluoride public drinking water thursday gov ron desantis signed florida farm bill includes language banning use additive public water system meet new definition ‚Äúwater quality additive‚Äù chemical substance used public water specifically address drinking water standards contaminants quality ‚Äúyes use fluoride teeth that‚Äôs fine forcing water supply basically forced medication people‚Äù desantis said ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt choice you‚Äôre taking away them‚Äù floridians use community water systems receive fluoridated water according florida surgeon general dr joseph ladapo issued guidance november recommending community water fluoridation citing potential health effects related article datafluoridefinaljpg know fluoride drinking water fluoride naturally occurring mineral that‚Äôs found soil rocks water varying degrees also byproduct fertilizer production recommendation us centers disease control prevention world health organization many cities added fluoride treated drinking water decades help protect teeth cavities cdc reiterated faith health benefits fluoride naming water fluoridation one ‚Äú greatest public health achievements st century‚Äù ada also emphasized ‚Äúeighty years community water fluoridation optimal levels proven safe effective reducing tooth decay improve oral health‚Äù however research showed exposure fluoridated water pregnancy associated increased neurobehavioral problems children federal review concluded higher levels linked lower iq kids related article dissected human teeth displayed office dentist dr james bekker april salt lake city utah ap photohannah schoenbaum utah‚Äôs ban fluoride public water simple change raises complicated new health risks experts say us health human services secretary robert f kennedy jr pledged roll back cdc recommendations fluoride added municipal drinking water promised panel experts review guidelines make new recommendations kennedy can‚Äôt formally prevent communities adding fluoride drinking water states cities followed lead march utah became first state ban fluoride public drinking water us food drug administration also said week starting process remove prescription fluoride tablets drops market they‚Äôre typically prescribed babies children high risk tooth decay drink water doesn‚Äôt contain added fluoride

ìMarket research and US C.D.C. statistics indicate that older individuals and those with underlying conditions are the populations most likely to seek out COVID-19 vaccination seasonally,î Novavax President and CEO John Jacobs said in a statement Saturday. ìThis significant milestone demonstrates our commitment to these populations and is a significant step towards availability of our protein-based vaccine option.î

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists a wide range of conditions that may make someone more likely to become severely ill with Covid-19, including older age, asthma, diabetes, lung disease, obesity and pregnancy.

The Novavax Covid-19 vaccine, which uses more traditional protein-based technology than the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, has been subject to emergency use authorization since 2022. Pfizer and Modernaís vaccines have been FDA-approved for people 12 and up and remain available under emergency use authorization for children as young as 6 months.


Novavaxís vaccine had been on track for full approval April 1, but the FDA delayed the decision while it sought more data, a source told CNN. The new approval letter issued Friday requires Novavax to conduct postmarketing studies looking at the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis ñ inflammation of the heart muscle and of the membrane surrounding the heart ñ in people who receive the vaccine.

These conditions have rarely been reported after Covid-19 vaccination, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A handful of cases were reported in trials of the Novavax vaccine, suggesting an increased risk, the CDC notes. However, the CDC and its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices have said the benefits of Covid-19 vaccination outweigh the rare risk of heart inflammation in all groups recommended for vaccination.

The CDCís vaccine advisers are considering changes to the agencyís guidance for who should get an annual Covid-19 shot. At last monthís meeting of, the committee discussed a recommendation focused on older adults, those with weakened immune systems and possibly those who are more likely to be exposed to the coronavirus.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services and a longtime anti-vaccine activist, has falsely called vaccines for Covid-19 ìthe deadliest vaccine ever madeî and more recently made misleading statements about the safety of the measles vaccine amid a massive outbreak centered in West Texas.

He was tired of just surviving. A pig kidney gave him a shot at living,"Tim Andrews knew that he needed dialysis to manage his end-stage kidney disease, but over months of treatment, he started to wonder whether it was worth it. He was exhausted and hopeless. He missed his grandkids.

It kept him alive, but it didnít feel like living.

Desperate for another option, he found a surprising alternative: an organ from a pig.

Andrews, 67, is a pioneer of a new kind of medicine. In January, he had an experimental cross-species transplant of a kidney from a genetically modified pig. He is one of only a handful of patients who have undergone the experimental procedure. For now, heís the lone person in the United States known to be living with a pig kidney.

Andrews knew that there was a risk to trying something so new, but if the kidney gave him just one more day free from dialysis, it was worth it ó for him and for fellow patients.


ìThis will do something for humanity,î Andrews said.

ëPick a boxí
Andrews had been living with diabetes since the 1990s, managing the condition with insulin. About 2Ω years ago, he went to the doctor feeling unusually tired. Tests showed that he had stage 3 kidney failure ó his kidneys were still working but less efficiently than they should. He was relieved to learn that it was manageable with medication, monitoring and lifestyle changes.

But about a month later, a doctor delivered more bad news: Andrewsí kidney disease had rapidly progressed to end-stage disease. Dialysis was the only option to keep him alive until he could get an organ transplant.


Dialysis is highly effective at cleaning the blood, but it places a ìhuge burdenî on the body, Andrewsí doctors told CNN. At first, Andrews thought it was going well. But about six months in, he had a heart attack.

ìIt takes a toll on you, emotionally and physically,î said Andrews, who lives in New Hampshire.

He was tempted to forgo dialysis entirely until a doctor warned that if he did so, he should ìpick a box.î With the state his kidneys were in, his body would be in it within a couple months.


For six hours, three days a week, he kept at it. On days off, heíd sleep. By the time he woke up, heíd have to start the process all over again.

When he thinks about his experience with dialysis, Andrews appreciates what the doctors and nurses did to keep him alive. But when he kept having to sit in that oversized green chair hooked up to the dialysis machine, the whole situation hurt his spirit, too.

He was too tired to walk or get groceries. He couldnít eat. Even in the few hours he felt OK, his immune system was so weak that he had to avoid crowds. Dialysis meant no more Red Sox games, no more fun with grandchildren, no more travel.

As the hours ticked past, he couldnít think about gratitude. All he could think about was death.

The dialysis side effects got so bad that he wanted to quit, but his wife, Karen, wouldnít let him. He also kept hearing his fatherís voice in his mind, telling him to stop complaining and start doing something about his situation.

ëI know what end-stage meansí
Andrews learned that his odds of getting a human kidney donation were not good.


Nearly 90,0000 people are on the waiting list for a kidney in the US. Most donít get a transplant because they become too sick or die while waiting for a match.

Andrewsí chances were slimmer than most because of his rare blood type. People typically wait about three to five years for a donor kidney. For him, it would likely be seven to 10 years. Doctors thought his body could take only five years of dialysis.

ìI was a little short there,î Andrews said. ìI know what end-stage means.î

But his research gave him hope. Massachusetts General Hospital was also investigating animal alternatives. He demanded that the hospital liaison put him in touch with one of the doctors from that project: Dr. Leonardo Riella, medical director of kidney transplantation at Mass General.


When they first met, Andrews was ìvery frail,î Riella said. He arrived in a wheelchair. But when Riella mentioned whatís known as xenotransplantation ó transplants using genetically modified pig organs ó Andrewsí eyes ìsparked.î

ìHe said ëTell me what I need to do.í î

Riella told Andrews heíd need to get a lot stronger if he wanted a transplant of any kind.

ìThey said, ëPrepare your body for battle,í î Andrewsí wife, Karen, remembered.


For the next few months, Andrews went to the gym and physical therapy, got his teeth fixed, got several vaccines and lost 22 pounds.


When he went back to the clinic a few months later, Riella said, Andrews was ìalmost running around the room.î

He talked to people about the procedure. He prayed. His wife, Karen, also had to agree: If they got the green light, she would need to sign consent papers. On the slim chance he got a virus from the organ, sheíd be exposed to it, too.

ìI was a little taken aback by that,î Karen said. But she didnít have any doubt that this transplant, though unusual, was the right way to go.

ìIt has to be better than dialysis,î she said. ìHe was just feeling so awful all the time.î

A new birthday
In January, it was finally time.


On surgery day, his family hugged and kissed him good-bye. Karen gave him a high-five and wished him luck.

The procedure was supposed to take four hours, but only about two hours and 15 minutes in, Karen said, her phone rang. The doctors were done early and said it went ìunbelievably well.î

A team of doctors told Karen that they had successfully attached the genetically modified pig kidney alongside Andrewsí nonfunctioning organ.


ìThey put the kidney on the table and started connecting him to the kidney, and he actually peed across the room,î Karen said, laughing. Everyone in the operating room started cheering.

ìOf course, I started bawling like a baby,î Karen said.

It all happened so fast that even the doctors who did the surgery were surprised.

ìIt worked right away, and the numbers started getting better,î Riella said.


After waking up from surgery, Andrews felt ìreenergized and revitalized.î

ìI was alive, and I hadnít been in a long time,î he said.

He hopped off the bed and tap-danced across the room, he said. His mind felt clear.

ìIt was a miracle,î Andrews said. So much so, he declared that he had a new birthday.


ìI said ëlook at me, itís like Iím like a new man,í î he said. ìItís like new birth. I said, ëIíve got a new birthday. 1/25/25 is my new birthday.í î

ëNow I can do anything I wantí
After the transplant, Andrews spent a week in the hospital but only out of an abundance of caution.

In the months since, heís had a few ìsmall bumps in the road,î including a three-week hospital stay. But the pig kidney does what a kidney from a living human donor would do.

Life is returning to normal. Andrews cooks, vacuums and takes long walks with his dog, Cupcake.

He currently takes more than 50 pills every day as the doctors try to figure out the type of medications heíll need with his new kidney. But living without dialysis has made such a difference.

ìBasically, I was just sleeping, sick all the time. Now I can do anything I want,î Andrews said.

He even lets himself picture a future. He canít wait to see his grandkids again.

ìThey saw me at the lowest, and now theyíll be able to see me alive and laughing and carrying on like Grandpa does,î Andrews said.

If all goes well, he hopes to take Karen to Europe in a year. He said theyíve put it off far too long.

ëItís a learning curveí
Still, Andrews knows that the pig kidney may not work long-term. Heís still on the wait list for a human organ. If the pig kidney can act as a bridge that keeps him healthy enough to wait for a match from a human donor, that would be a medical first ó and a success.

Andrews is the fourth living patient in the US to get a genetically modified pig kidney transplant, and he wonít be the last. In addition to the ongoing trial at Mass General in conjunction with biotech firm eGenesis, United Therapeutics Corp ñ the other main biotech company helping create the pig kidneys ñ announced in February that it would be allowed to start its own clinical trials with New York University.

In March 2024, Richard Slayman became the first living patient in the world to get a genetically modified pig kidney. The operation at Mass General went well, but he died two months later from causes not related to the transplant.

Doctors said they learned a lot from their experience with Slayman. He had scarring on his heart after eight years of dialysis, Riella said, and itís probably important to get patients like Andrews, who havenít needed dialysis as long.

In April 2024, Lisa Pisano became the first person to receive a mechanical heart pump as well as a gene-edited pig kidney. The organ failed due to limited blood flow and was removed the next month. She died in July 2024.

Then, in November 2024, NYU transplanted 53-year-old Towana Looney with a genetically modified pig kidney. It functioned for four months and nine days, the longest yet, but doctors had to remove it in April when her immune system started to reject it.

Figuring out how to manage rejection is going to be key, doctors say. The pig kidneys Andrews and Slayman got had 69 genomic edits, while Looneyís had fewer. Doctors say they still donít know how many edits are necessary, but both versions of the modified pig kidneys had pig genes removed and human genes added to make the organ more compatible with the human body.

Patients also receive anti-rejection drugs and wearable remote monitoring tools. But doctors still are figuring out how much medicine and monitoring is needed.

ìIt is a learning curve,î Riella said.

Riella is hopeful xenotransplantation may one day solve the worldís organ shortage.

ìI think patients like Tim will be remembered as heroes,î he said. ìWithout them willing to take the risk, we wouldnít be able to move this to the clinic.î

Andrews remembers what it felt like to have to make the choice. But he also remembers what it was like to sit for hours at the dialysis center.

ìItís hard to come to terms with mortality. You think ëah, I can handle thatí and everything, but itís tough,î he said recently, back in the green chair where he underwent dialysis. ìIt was very tough to realize that was it.

ìI was going to die in this building.î

He found a way out. He hopes his story will inspire others to look for hope, too.

ìI see way too many people give up,î Andrews said. ìDonít give up.î

Why a sheet pan is the secret to make every meal easier than ever,"Throughout more than two decades of developing new recipes as ìHungry Girl,î Lisa Lillien has amassed quite the collection of appliances. Her kitchen counter is lined with an air fryer, slow cooker, Instant pot, blender, toaster and more. But if you ask Lillien, who says, ìIím not a dietitian, Iím not a nutritionist, Iím just hungry,î thereís one tool she comes back to again and again: the sheet pan.

ìWhy sheet pans right now? I hear from my email subscribers often, and nearly everybody wants easier and faster options,î Lillien said. ìSheet pans really are an MVP of the kitchen because you can place something on the pan, pop it in the oven and you can go about your day.î

Unlike some of those other tools, it wonít take up precious counter space and often is available for less than $20.

ìIím not a cooking snob. I donít think you need a certain pan, and it certainly doesnít have to be expensive,î Lillien said, noting that the sheet pan she swears by has been in her arsenal since 1999.

The ingredients you cook on it need not be exclusive, either. ìWeíre not promoting that you go buy every grocery from a boutique grocery store,î she noted. ìHungry Girl is more Walmart than Vanity Fair. I mean that in the best way possible; itís just for everybody. As am I. I want to make smarter, better food choices, but I also love food.î

Thatís the philosophy behind her entire Hungry Girl empire, which includes free daily emails with recipes and healthy cooking tips, a magazine, a podcast (that often reviews products available at major online and in-person retailers), and 16 cookbooks. In the latest, ìHungry Girl Sheet Pan Cookbook: One-Pan Wonders Under 400 Calories,î Lillien shares under-400-calorie recipe ideas for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, sides and desserts ó all made on a sheet pan.


ìSheet pans can do it all: baking, roasting, broiling and even serving,î Lillien wrote in her book. Theyíre ìa breeze to clean. Plus, the raised edges help contain oven spills and drips.î

Taking a cue from popular fast food restaurant menu items, viral food trends and beloved comfort foods, the cookbook includes one-pan tricks to make every meal easier. We asked Lillien to coach us through an entire day of sheet pan eats.

Whatís for breakfast?
When flapjacks are doctored up with a big pat of butter and generous shower of maple syrup, ìpancakes are not always the healthiest. Theyíre not always easy to cook evenly, either,î Lillien said. ìWhen I make pancakes with a skillet or griddle, I often end up burning the later batches because the heat of the pan can be challenging to control.î


Lillien sought a solution, which she found and integrated into her recipes for brownie, strawberry and blueberry pancake bars. A sheet pan cooks the batter evenly and allows you to make a weekís worth of pancake squares that you can enjoy now, refrigerate for tomorrow or freeze for later.

To try this at home: Line a sheet pan with parchment paper and spritz it with oil or nonstick cooking spray. Mix up your favorite pancake batter. (Lillien digs a whole wheat flour-based blend for a fiber boost.) Pour it into the prepared sheet pan, sprinkle on any desired toppings, like berries or chocolate chips. and bake at 425 degrees Fahrenheit for about 15 to 17 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the center springs back when you touch it.

Itís like In-N-Out for lunch
Typically, if you attempted to recreate a fast food value meal at home, youíd need a deep fryer, grill or griddle, and perhaps a skillet to cook some of the toppings, such as onions or bacon. But Lillienís ìultimate lunchî ó In-N-Out Burger copycat Animal-Style Burger Patties ó shows how to DIY on sheet pans. You could try this same concept with any burger and fries you like.

Pictured is Lisa Lillien's take on In-N-Out's Animal-Style Burger Patties, with turnip fries.

For her fast food-inspired midday meal, it all starts with the sauce. In a small bowl, stir together ? cup Thousand Island dressing (light, if you like), 2 tablespoons finely minced onion, Ω teaspoon sugar and Ω teaspoon white wine vinegar. If you have another favorite burger sauce, feel free to swap that in.

Then prepare º-pound burger patties with whatever meat and seasonings you desire. (Lillien likes 95% lean ground beef jazzed up with garlic powder, onion powder, salt and black pepper ó the same spice blend she uses to season the fries.)


Place the burgers and 2 cups of chopped onion on one sheet pan, and fry-shaped spears of turnips or any root vegetable or sturdy squash on another. Bake at 425 F until the fries are crispy, the onions are tender and the burgers are cooked to your preferred doneness level. Top a serving of fries with a patty, a spoonful of sauce, a scoop of cooked onions and a slice of cheddar cheese. Bake until the sauce is hot and the cheese is melty.

Itís time for dinner
An often-overlooked benefit of sheet pan cooking, according to Lillien, is the ability to multitask. The large cooking surface makes it possible to cook multiple items on the same sheet without overcrowding. One of Lillienís favorite recipes in the book, Honey Mustard Pretzel Salmon with Roasted Carrots, asks for just 35 minutes and six ingredients, and leaves you with a well-balanced main dish and a side.


ìHoney mustard is such a good flavor-booster. Itís very versatile and so low in calories,î Lillien said, and it works like the ìglueî to adhere the crushed pretzels. ìThe richness of the salmon works so nicely with the tang and the sweetness of the honey mustard and the salty pretzels.î

The best kind of workout? One that trains both your body and brain,"(CNN) ó We already know exercise is good for our bodies, but itís also an essential tool for managing mental health. Yet many people still separate physical fitness from mental wellness, viewing them as two different goals rather than parts of the same whole.

Too often, workout routines are designed with only the body in mind, focusing on burning calories, building strength or improving flexibility. Whatís often missing is intentionality ó movement designed not just to make you sweat but also to help you feel better mentally and emotionally.

Early research suggests why exercise is so protective against brain disease

Research shows that consistent physical activity can ease symptoms of anxiety and depression, sharpen executive functioning and improve sleep quality, a key factor in emotional regulation and overall mental health. But not all movement is created equal when it comes to mental health. The type of movement ó and how you approach it ó matters.

As a mind-body coach in professional sports for more than two decades, I have helped elite athletes build durable, mobile bodies while also supporting their mental resilience ó using movement and breath to regulate the nervous system, stay grounded under pressure and maintain sharp focus. These same tools and principles can help anyone strengthen body and mind, improving how they move and feel every day.

Mindful movement vs. just exercising
Pushing yourself through a high-intensity workout while mentally checked out or disconnected from your body doesnít offer the same mental health benefits as moving with awareness. True mind-body fitness involves being present during movement, using intentional breathing and training in ways that support your nervous system.


The brain and body are deeply interconnected through the nervous system. One of the key players in this connection is the vagus nerve, which runs from your brain stem to your gut and influences functions as varied as heart rate, digestion, mood and emotional regulation.

When you exercise with focused, deep breathing ó you stimulate the vagus nerve, which activates your parasympathetic nervous system (your ìrest and recoverî state). Doing so can calm your mind, lower stress and improve focus by shifting your body out of ìfight-or-flightî mode, helping you achieve restful states more easily.

On the other hand, when exercise is overly intense or performed with poor breathing patterns and no recovery, it can spike stress hormones and leave you feeling more depleted than energized. Thatís why itís important to choose exercises and formats that align with your needs and goals ó not just physically, but mentally and emotionally, too.

How to build a mind-body fitness routine
You donít need to overhaul your workout regimen to make it more mind-body focused. Start by layering in these five simple strategies. Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain.

1. Anchor your workouts with breath
Breath is the most efficient and effective way to influence your nervous system. Use slow, intentional breathing before, during and after your workouts.


ï In warm-ups: Use diaphragmatic breathing to downshift from your day and connect to your body.

Optimize your breathing with these tips

ï During mobility work: Use your breathing to move your rib cage in ways that support better posture, positioning and rotation. For example, when twisting your upper body to the right, use inhalations to expand your ribs on the right side and exhale to contract your ribs on the left side, to facilitate the rotation.

ï During strength training: Exhale through the effort phase ó as you would when pushing up in a push-up or standing up from a squat ó to activate core control and regulate tension.


ï In cooldowns: Practice extended exhales, which further stimulate the vagus nerve, to promote relaxation and recovery. I recommend doubling the length of your exhales during recovery sessions by practicing a four-count inhale with an eight-count exhale.

2. Incorporate mobility with intention
Mobility training improves flexibility and joint health, but its benefits go beyond the physical. Practicing breath-driven mobility drills, such as the three-way hip flexor release and windmill twist to also sharpen body awareness and support nervous system regulation. Add exercises such as these to your warm-ups or active recovery days, focusing on coordinating breath and movement to build physical control and mental clarity.

3. Balance intensity to build resilience
High-intensity workouts have benefits, but overdoing them can chronically elevate stress levels and impair recovery. To support your nervous system, balance your weekly training with lower-intensity sessions. Activities such as walking, yoga, breath-focused mobility and body-weight strength work help keep you active while promoting resilience, emotional regulation and injury prevention.

4. Train with presence and precision
No matter what type of training youíre doing ó strength, mobility, cardio or recovery ó your mental presence affects how your body performs and adapts. Rushing through reps or zoning out increases the risk of poor form, injury and missed benefits. Focus on the quality of your movement: Pay attention to alignment, control your pace and stay aware of how your body feels. When your mind starts to wander, use your breath to ground yourself in the present and reconnect with your body. Presence turns every exercise into an opportunity to build both physical skill and mental clarity.

5. Build in mental check-ins

Before, during and after your workouts, take 30 seconds at a time to assess how you feel. Ask yourself: Where am I holding tension? Howís my breathing? What do I need right now ó intensity or grounding?

These moments of self-awareness turn your fitness practice into a tool for emotional regulation, not just physical conditioning.

How to structure a mind-body-focused week
Hereís a sample weekly structure to balance strength, mobility and nervous system support:


Two days: Strength training with breath-focused movement prep and mobility cooldown.

Two days: Breath-driven mobility or Pilates and low-intensity cardio (walking, light cycling, etc.).

One day: A recovery day with breathwork and gentle stretching or yoga.

Two days: Mixed training (circuit or flow-style) that blends mobility, strength and cardio.

Although having a plan is important, mind-body fitness is about listening to how you feel and adjusting accordingly. Movement can shift your mental and emotional state, but it works best when you begin with awareness and choose what best meets your needs, whether that means calming down or boosting energy. The goal is to support ó not override ó your system.

Remember, a mind-body fitness routine isnít about doing less, itís about doing what serves you more completely. By training with awareness, incorporating breath and mobility, and respecting the needs of your nervous system, youíll not only feel stronger ó youíll feel more focused, resilient and grounded in

"Disrupted US vaccine meetings could threaten timelines, access and transparency around shots","CNN
 ó 
Two long-planned vaccine meetings ó one at the US Centers for Disease Control and another at the US Food and Drug Administration ó have now been disrupted under the watch of US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., stirring questions about whether seasonal flu shots or other lifesaving vaccines will be delayed or harder to access.

The February meeting of the CDCís Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, was postponed ìto accommodate public comment,î according to a note online. The three-day meeting, which had been scheduled for this week, was to review the safety and effectiveness of vaccines for meningococcal disease, which is seeing a resurgence, as well as RSV, flu, chikungunya and mpox. It also included two votes related to Vaccines for Children, the government program that buys and distributes vaccines to state and local health departments for children whose families wouldnít otherwise be able to pay for them.

FDA meeting to choose flu vaccine composition canceled without explanation

ACIP typically meets three times a year, in February, June and October. Thereís no word on whether or when the February meeting will be rescheduled and itís unclear whether the delay will hinder access to shots.

On Wednesday, the FDA canceled a March 13 meeting of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, which was to discuss the recipe manufacturers must follow to make this fallís flu shots. No explanation was given for the cancellation.

In a statement to CNN on Thursday, the FDA said it would still weigh in on the makeup of flu shots but didnít indicate whether it would seek its advisersí guidance or allow for the public discussion and debate that usually occurs.

ìThe FDA will make public its recommendations to manufacturers in time for updated vaccines to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season,î the statement said.

The uncertainty around the governmentís process for regulating and recommending vaccines comes as the US is in the grips of a brutal flu season and experiencing a resurgence of measles, a vaccine preventable disease. Experts say these infections are increasing because of growing hesitancy to use vaccines, something they fear the new HHS director will only encourage.

Kennedy casts doubt on vaccine advisers
Kennedy maintains that he is not anti-vaccine, but he has repeatedly cast doubt on the safety and effectiveness of immunizations and questioned the research and regulations that allow them to be used.

Kennedy, whose financial disclosures show he has made money from law firms that sue vaccine manufacturers, has also impugned some of the experts who advise federal agencies on vaccines. During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy incorrectly stated that 97% of the members of the CDCís vaccine advisory committee had conflicts of interest. In fact, the panel has strict policies to guard against conflicts, and a screening process for members to ensure they are impartial when they vote.

Members of FDAís vaccine committee are also subject to strict conflict of interest rules and are required to disclose potential conflicts during meetings.

This week, former CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden wrote that false claims that ACIP members vote based on their financial ties is among the ìmost damagingî falsehoods about vaccines.

Frieden said the 97% figure comes from a 2009 report, issued when he was CDC director. He is now president and CEO of the nonprofit Resolve to Save Lives.

It was an audit of lengthy and detailed conflict of interest forms submitted by all experts who served as CDC advisers in 2007. He said 97% had at least one missing response, which could have meant someone forgot to do something as simple as initial a page. He said it is not the same thing as a conflict of interest.

ìI really think that this is classic misinformation,î Frieden told CNN.

Frieden also raised alarm about the postponed ACIP meeting, writing in a recent post on LinkedIn, ìItís certain there will be misleading, inaccurate information claiming ACIP members have conflicts of interest. Hereís the plain truth: ACIP, made up of pediatricians, public health specialists, and parents, is the gold standard for open, transparent recommendations on vaccine safety and effectiveness.î

In this 2019 photo, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) scientist examines the results of a hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) test.

ìCancelling this meeting means vaccine makers may not have the vital information and time they need to produce and distribute targeted vaccines before the next flu season,î Dr. Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said after the cancellation of the FDA flu shot meeting. ìIf the FDA meeting is not immediately rescheduled, many lives that could be saved by vaccination will be lost.î

In a February 20 open letter to Kennedy, Acting CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez and Sen. Bill Cassidy, a doctor and chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, a coalition of groups called the Partnership to Fight Infectious Disease pushed for the ìprompt reschedulingî of the ACIP meeting.

ìEach ACIP meeting holds tremendous weight and relevance. Infectious diseases are constantly evolving opponents; vaccines are among the best tools for constantly adapting and responding to the latest public health threats,î the letter said.

ìMaking America healthy requires healthy discussion and timely, evidence-based decisions. This meeting should be no different.î

Flu shot decision in limbo
There are several different ways to make flu vaccines, but the most common is to grow the selected candidate viruses in chicken eggs ó a painstaking operation that takes months to finish.

For that reason, selection of the strains that will be included in flu vaccines is carefully orchestrated to be sure that manufacturers can deliver their shots to doctorís offices and pharmacies in time.

In order for flu vaccines to be sold in the US, they must contain strains that are officially selected by the FDA.

That decision typically comes after a meeting of the World Health Organizationís Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, a network of seven collaborating centers and four essential regulatory labs, which are based in the US, UK, Japan, China, Russia and Australia. Both the CDC and FDA are members, and representatives from both agencies participated in the deliberations which got underway this week, WHO said.

ìThe US did participate in this meeting,î Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHOís technical lead for Covid-19, said at a news briefing on Friday.

ìI want to be very clear that the US is still contributing. I know that thereís a lot of attention on the US right now, but we are going to continue to emphasize the importance of this global system thatís in place.î

These experts meet twice a year ó in the fall and spring ó to choose strains for countries in the Southern and Northern Hemispheres.

On Friday, WHO announced the strains that it thinks will most closely match the viruses that will be making people sick next fall. Those picks would swap out the H3N2 component of this years vaccine, which was only a partial match to the circulating viruses, for a new one.

ìI think the match is not perfect, but it is a reasonable match, and is still the best preventative we have against infection with influenza,î said Prof. Ian Barr, deputy director at the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory, and a member of GISRS, in a new briefing after the strain selection

The FDA said it will make public its recommendations to vaccine manufacturers in time for updated shots to be available for the 2025-26 flu season.

What typically happens next is that the 17-member FDA vaccine committee would meet and publicly discuss the recommendation, and then make its own endorsement. The agency ultimately makes the final decision, which can differ from its advisersí, although they generally align.

This year, there wonít be an advisory meeting. The FDA said it would still make recommendations to manufacturers but didnít specify how it would come to a decision or when.

ìIf thereís no FDA recommended strains, the US manufacturers are kind of stuck,î said Dr. LJ Tan who is chief policy and partnerships officer for nonprofit vaccine advocacy group Immunize.org.

Flu vaccine manufacturers contacted by CNN on Thursday said the missed VRBPAC meeting wouldnít break their stride.

ìJust as every year, we have already begun production for the 2025-2026 flu season in the Northern Hemisphere and will be ready to support final strain selections in time for the season,î wrote Sanofi in a statement to CNN.

GSK also said it will continue to work with FDA on its flu strain recommendation in the US.

But canceling the VRBPAC meeting will deprive Americans of public discussion and debate that happens when these experts meet. It makes the process less transparent, Immunize.orgís Tan said.

ìItís very dangerous to bypass your expert advisory committee,î Tan said.

When experts are out of the conversation
In his Senate confirmation hearings, Kennedy promised ìradical transparencyî at HHS.

ìPublic health agencies should be transparent and if we want Americans to restore trust in the public health agencies, we need transparency,î Kennedy said.

Vaccine advocates say canceling advisory committee meetings undermines that goal.

ìYou heard what we thought. We disagreed on some things, and for people who are interested, you can see how we arrived at the conclusion that we did,î said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a member of FDAís VRBPAC who is also a pediatrician and immunologist at the University of Iowa.

Perlman said he was also worried that skipping committee meetings would deprive the public of a window into the governmentís vaccine decisions.

ìThe country is in so much flux right now about what it thinks about vaccines, what it thinks about medical devices, what it thinks about drugs. The more transparency there is, hopefully, the more people who are undecided about things will see where the committee is coming from,î Perlman told CNNís Meg Tirrell.

Other experts agreed the committees are an important layer of independent review.

ìItís kind of taking experts out of the conversation,î said Dr. William Moss, a pediatrician who directs of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ìMany of these decisions are tricky and nuanced, and having the opportunity for a group of experts who are familiar with these vaccines and familiar with these diseases. You know, have an open discussion is critically important.î

The FDA has not said how it will choose vaccine strains for the fall, but if it follows WHOís recommendation, it will mean that the US will be relying on data from the organization despite President Donald Trumpís order that the US withdraw its support from WHO and stop sharing information.

ìItís part of the chaos, whether itís planned or not, or just incompetence,î Moss said.

"Harvard Law School bought a copy of Magna Carta for $27. Turns out, it's actually an original","CNN
 ó 
A ìcopyî of Magna Carta bought decades ago by Harvard Law School for just $27.50 is now understood to be an extremely rare original from 1300, according to new research.

British historians were able to verify the documentís true authenticity after an academic stumbled across the item while looking through Harvard Law Schoolís online archives.

ìI was just working at homeÖ looking for unofficial copies of Magna Carta and finding quite a lot of them,î David Carpenter, a professor of medieval history at Kingís College London, told CNN Thursday, recounting the moment he made the discovery.

ìI finally came to Harvard Law School manuscript number 172, clicked on that, expecting to see a statute book. And what I sawÖ was an original of the 1300 Magna Carta,î Carpenter said.

Shocked by his discovery, the academic said he quickly contacted Nicholas Vincent, a professor of medieval history at the University of East Anglia and a fellow ìMagna Carta pundit.î

ìI said, ëis this what I think it is?í And he said, ëyeah, I think it is too,íî Carpenter recounted.


Magna Carta (Great Charter) is often regarded as the earliest declaration of human rights, credited with enshrining the rights of man in English law.

According to the United Kingdomís Parliament website, the charter was the first ìto put into writing the principle that the king and his government was not above the law.î

Today, it is revered around the world as the document that established the principle that everyone ñ including the monarch ñ was subject to the rule of law.

ìHe (the King) couldnít just say, ëoff with your head, into prison, Iím seizing your property.í If he wanted to act against you, he had to do so by due legal process,î Carpenter said.

The academics believe that the Harvard document is one of just seven from King Edward Iís 1300 issue of Magna Carta that still survive.

Amanda Watson, Harvard Law Schoolís assistant dean for library services, congratulated the work of the British academics on their ìfantastic discovery.î She added that the new research ìexemplifies what happens when magnificent collections, like Harvard Law Libraryís, are opened to brilliant scholars.î

Harvardís Law School Library bought the document in 1946 via auction from London bookdealers Sweet & Maxwell, according to its accession register. The auction catalogue described the manuscript as a ìcopyÖmade in 1327Ö somewhat rubbed and damp-stained,î a press release announcing the discovery said. The London bookdealers had only owned it for a short time, having bought it from World War I pilot Air Vice Marshal Maynard, whoíd inherited it from two leading campaigners against the slave trade.

ìThe provenance of this document is just fantastic,î Vincent said in the press release. ìGiven where it is, given present problems over liberties, over the sense of constitutional tradition in America, you couldnít invent a provenance that was more wonderful than this.î

Multiple tell-tale signs initially gave away the documentís authenticity, Carpenter said, including the style of handwriting and the big ìEî at the start of the first line ñ which stands for ìEdwardus.î

The documentís dimensions at 48.9 centimeters (19.3 inches) by 47.3 centimeters (18.6 inches) were also consistent with those found in the six previously known?originals.

Later, ultraviolet images and other images provided by Harvard Law School were used to ìmatch upî the text of the new document to the other originals, Carpenter said.

ìThat made me convinced that it was indeed authentic,î Carpenter added.

So, what will happen to the document now?

Both academics are due to visit Harvard in June for a celebration to mark the discovery of the medieval document.

Oncedead thrusters on the farthest spacecraft from Earth are in action again,"CNN
 ó 
Engineers at NASA say they have successfully revived thrusters aboard Voyager 1, the farthest spacecraft from our planet, in the nick of time before a planned communications blackout.

A side effect of upgrades to an Earth-based antenna that sends commands to Voyager 1 and its twin, Voyager 2, the communications pause could have occurred when the probe faced a critical issue ó thruster failure ó leaving the space agency without a way to save the historic mission. The new fix to the vehicleís original roll thrusters, out of action since 2004, could help keep the veteran spacecraft operating until itís able to contact home again next year.

Voyager 1, launched in September 1977, uses more than one set of thrusters to function properly. Primary thrusters carefully orient the spacecraft so it can keep its antenna pointed at Earth. This ensures that the probe can send back data it collects from its unique perspective 15.5 billion miles (25 billion kilometers) away in interstellar space, as well as receive commands sent by the Voyager team.

Within the primary set are additional thrusters that control the spacecraftís roll, which enables Voyager 1 to remain pointed at a guide star so it can remain oriented in space.

If Voyager canít control its roll motion, the mission could be threatened.

But as the thrusters fire, tiny amounts of propellant residue have built up over time. So far, engineers have managed to avoid clogging by commanding Voyager 1 to cycle between its original and backup thrusters for orientation, as well as a set of thrusters that were used to change the spacecraftís trajectory during planetary flybys in the 1980s. The trajectory thrusters, however, do nothing to contribute to the spacecraftís roll.

Voyager 1ís original roll thrusters stopped working more than two decades ago after power was lost in two internal heaters, which means the spacecraft has been relying on the backup roll thrusters to remain pointed at a guide star ever since.

ìI think at that time, the team was OK with accepting that the primary roll thrusters didnít work, because they had a perfectly good backup,î said Kareem Badaruddin, Voyager mission manager at NASAís Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, in a statement. ìAnd, frankly, they probably didnít think the Voyagers were going to keep going for another 20 years.î

Now, Voyager 1 engineers are concerned that clogging from the residue could cause the spacecraftís backup roll thrusters to stop working as soon as this fall ó and they had to get creative, as well as take risks, to revive the long-defunct primary roll thrusters.

Fixing broken equipment in space
When the heaters on the primary roll thrusters failed in 2004, engineers thought they couldnít be fixed. But with the threat posed by clogging looming, the team returned to the drawing board to see what had gone wrong.

Engineers considered the possibility that a disturbance in the circuits controlling the power supply to the heaters flipped a switch to the wrong position ó and flipping it to the original position might restart the heaters, and in turn, the primary roll thrusters.

But it wasnít a straightforward solution for a probe thatís operating so far away. The spacecraft is currently beyond the heliosphere, the sunís bubble of magnetic fields and particles that extends well beyond the orbit of Pluto.

The mission team had to take a risk by switching Voyager 1 to its primary roll thrusters and turning them on before attempting to fix and restart the heaters. The heaters could only function if the thrusters are also switched on.

If Voyager 1 drifted too far from its guide star, the spacecraftís programming would trigger the roll thrusters to fire ó but if the heaters werenít turned on yet at that moment, the automatic sequence could have triggered a small explosion.

A nail-biting test
In addition to the risk, the team, which began its work earlier this year, was facing a time constraint. A giant Earth-based antenna in Canberra, Australia, went offline May 4 for upgrades that will be ongoing until February 2026. NASAís Deep Space Network enables the agency to communicate with all of its spacecraft ó but its Canberra antenna is the only one with enough signal strength to send commands to the Voyager probes.

ìThese antenna upgrades are important for future crewed lunar landings, and they also increase communications capacity for our science missions in deep space, some of which are building on the discoveries Voyager made,î said Suzanne Dodd, Voyager project manager and director of the Interplanetary Network at JPL, which manages the Deep Space Network for NASA, in a statement. ìWeíve been through downtime like this before, so weíre just preparing as much as we can.î

While the antenna will briefly operate in August and December, the mission team members wanted to command Voyager 1 to test its long-dormant thrusters before they could no longer communicate with the spacecraft. This way, if they need to turn on the thrusters in August, the team would know whether that was a viable option.

On March 20, the team waited to see the results return from Voyager 1 after sending a command to the probe the day before to activate the thrusters and heaters. It takes more than 23 hours for data to travel back from Voyager 1 to Earth due to the sheer distance between the two.

Had the test failed, Voyager 1 may have already been at risk. But the team watched the data stream in, showing the temperature of the thruster heaters rising dramatically, and knew it had worked.

ìIt was such a glorious moment. Team morale was very high that day,î said Todd Barber, the missionís propulsion lead at JPL, in a statement. ìThese thrusters were considered dead. And that was a legitimate conclusion. Itís just that one of our engineers had this insight that maybe there was this other possible cause and it was fixable.

"Ancient poetry unveils hidden history of critically endangered finless porpoises, scientists say","CNN
 ó 
A research team in China got creative in its efforts to save a critically endangered species by turning to ancient poems. The scientists pored over more than 700 ancient Chinese poems from the Tang through the Qing dynasties that mention the Yangtze finless porpoise to find out where and when poets described seeing the animal because little is known about its population history.

The Yangtze finless porpoise ó the worldís only freshwater porpoise ó has faced extreme declines in numbers in the past four decades. With fewer than 1,300 individuals left in the wild, scientists in eastern China have made huge efforts to better understand the animalís past habitat range to better inform future conservation initiatives.

The findings were stark: The data suggests that the historic range of the finless porpoise has shrunk by 65% over the past 1,200 years, with the most extreme reduction happening over the past century. The team published the findings in the journal Current Biology on May 5.

ìSome older fishers told me they used to frequently see porpoises in areas where theyíve now disappeared completely,î study coauthor Zhigang Mei told CNN in an email. ìThat really sparked my curiosity: Where did these porpoises historically live?î

Yangtze finless porpoises only live in the middle-lower Yangtze River basin in eastern China. From the early 1980s until the 2010s, the population steeply declined an estimated 60%, according to a 2014 study, due to a combination of illegal fishing practices, industrial pollution in waterways, dams and sand mining in the adjoining lakes.

Because hard scientific data for the porpoise only exists for recent decades, scientists have a very narrow understanding of its spatial distribution. This creates a problem known as shifting baseline syndrome, explained Mei, a professor at the Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in Wuhan.


ì(This research) answers important questions about what constitutes a healthy population,î he said, which will help with setting realistic management goals. ìWithout historical baselines, there is a risk of shifting expectations downward over generations, accepting an ever-declining status as ënormal.íî

Playing with poems
When Mei and his colleagues started poking around archives for answers, they were surprised. Official records such as local gazettes and county chronicles didnít have any information about the porpoises ó only terrestrial megafauna like tigers and elephants, species that have frequent conflict with humans.

A Ming Dynasty poem from ìCompendium of the Three Powers,î compiled by Wang Qi (1573ñ1620), records the Yangtze finless porpoise's morphological details, surfacing postures and rearing behaviors.

Porpoises, in contrast, are less likely to have close encounters with humans. (No drama, no record.) Instead, sightings were typically by local, less-educated anglers or wealthy travelers ó who caught glimpses of the elusive porpoises while traveling the Yangtze River by boat ó and werenít formally recorded, Mei said.

Facing this dead end, the scientists realized ancient poems could come in handy.

ìWe were amazed,î Mei said of the researchers efforts to explore written documentation via literature.

The authors sorted through hundreds of poems dating back to AD 830 that referenced porpoises. For each poem, the scientists looked for evidence of locations, such as descriptions of unique geographical features of the Yangtze River basin. Then, the team researched the poemís time period and each poetsí personal history to ensure their accuracy. About half of the poems contained precise location information, allowing the team to map sightings for each dynasty.

Ancient Chinese poetry is often nonfiction, including first-person accounts of everyday life and observations of nature, the authors explained. Thatís why the poems served as a reasonable metric for finless porpoise sightings throughout the river basin.

ìEmerald seals the jade-green tiles as idle dawn clouds drift / Specks of porpoises vanish between the wavesí swift lift,î reads one Qing Dynasty poem by Gu SilÏ ??? called ìCrossing the River in Rain, Looking at Jinshan,î as translated by lead study author Yaoyao Zhang, an ecologist at the Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

ìItís beautiful, actually,î said Paulo Corti, a conservation ecologist at Austral University of Chile who was not involved in the research. ìThey did something great with some very simple information.î

Using historic materials for science isnít uncommon ó especially in paleontology or archaeology ó but itís less often used for wildlife research, Corti said.

ìItís a very useful tool, especially when you refine the analysis, taking those qualitative data into quantitative (data),î he said.

Using literature as data
The poetry data only offers an estimate. However, itís the study authorsí best source for formulating how the Yangtze finless porpoise populationís distribution changed before modern times.

Such studies need to be conducted carefully, adds Corti, who has written journal articles about responsibly using historical records for wildlife studies after noticing that some scientists were using such data inappropriately.

One major limitation of cultural records is human error, he explained. A fisherman or hunter, for example, is a more reliable observer than a foreign explorer likely to misidentify similar-looking animals. Thatís why the study authors researched each poetís background, such as where they lived and traveled, to verify their observations.

The Yangtze finless porpoise looks distinct, with a short snout, dark gray color and signature lack of a dorsal fin, which sets it apart from its dolphin relatives.

As mammals, porpoises need to surface for air, making them visible to humans, said study coauthor Jiajia Liu, a professor of biodiversity science at Fudan University in Shanghai. And because finless porpoises did not historically hold cultural importance, it was less likely for poets to write about them without a literal observation, he added.

For these reasons, the researchers trusted the poems for data.

That said, the authors acknowledge that some historical references of the river porpoise could be confused with the now-extinct baiji, a freshwater dolphin that lived in the Yangtze. But this species was much bigger, lighter-colored, and touted a long snout ó its most distinguishing feature, Mei said.

Conservation goals
Indeed, the baiji serves as a cautionary tale for the finless porpoise. The freshwater dolphin already became functionally extinct in 2006 from many of the same threats.

Extinction of the finless porpoise would throw the ecosystem out of balance, Liu explained. As a top predator, the porpoise eats fish that feed on aquatic grasses. The rare mammal is also an ecosystem engineer by facilitating a process called nutrient cycling. By migrating long distances, the finless porpoise carries nitrogen and phosphorus from the river bottom to its surface, and from downstream to upstream.

Now that there is some evidence that the finless porpoise lived not only in the main river, but also in tributaries and lakes, scientists have a better idea of where the porpoise historically thrived ó and whether it might thrive in those locations once again.

With captive breeding ó a process in which endangered species are bred in captivity and released back into the wild ó underway since 1996, the authors hope their new findings may help inform future conservation efforts, such as identifying areas where they can be released.

But itís important not to jump to conclusions, Corti warned. Using such information for modern-day wildlife management requires a thorough understanding of species behavior, morphology, diet and other factors, he said. ìYou can make a lot of mistakesî extrapolating historic observational data to inform future management decisions, he added.

ìIf you are trying to see what happened with the species in the past, you need to know what is going on now,î Corti said.

Importantly, Mei noted, this study creates a link between endangered species and culture, which could attract public attention. If the Yangtze finless porpoise can be a flagship species, such as the panda, it will help improve their conservation, he said.

Over the past few years, the porpoise population increased for the first time, thanks in part to conservation policies such as fishing bans.

ìConservation is not only (for) scientists,î Mei said. ìItís about everyone, itís about our culture.î

Beyoncs mom talks about the choices she made while raising her daughters,"Tina Knowles remembers growing up in a loving and raucous family of nine. She was the youngest of seven children. Add in her cousins, and they were a force to be reckoned with whenever they left the house.

At a very early age, Knowles says she was taught not to draw any attention to herself. ìPretty is as pretty does,î her mom used to say.

In other words, be quiet, know your place.

Lucky for us all, she didnít listen. On a book tour for her new memoir, ìMatriarch,î an Oprahís Book Club selection, she talked to me at CNNís offices in New York about what she learned from her own childhood and her choices while raising her daughters, BeyoncÈ and Solange Knowles.

CNN
On Motherís Day weekend, hereís what the businesswoman, fashion designer and mother of two of the most famous entertainers in the world wanted to share.

Donít limit your children
Teaching kids to be seen and not heard was a common way of parenting back when ìMama Tinaî was growing up in Galveston, Texas, during segregation. Her mom, her teachers at her Catholic school and all the adults around her made clear what role she was expected to play.


To Knowles, that translated into trying to make herself small and insignificant ó even though she was born with a big personality, big feelings and many opinions. But Knowles simply couldnít follow the quiet rule and was quickly given a nickname: ìBadass Tenie B.î

ìThat was not a term of endearment when I was little,î Knowles told me in a recent conversation. ìThey used to just say, here comes that Badass Tenie B because I was hyper, I talked back.î Now, she says she recognizes her willfulness and hyper behavior stemmed from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. Which, she reflects, ìwasnít a thing then.î

Knowles attended a school where nuns ruled the roost. She said there were teachers who told her she didnít belong, that she was unsalvageable and a bad seed. The words punctured her soul and made her hate going to school.

ìThey thought they were doing the best thing,î Knowles said, but it hurt terribly.


She would run home to tell her mother and could not understand why her mom would never take her side. She didnít know her mother was working herself to the bone for the church to get Knowles and her siblings an education.

From her own experience at school and in her childhood community, Knowles said itís so important to really think about what you are saying to children. Labels can affect them for a lifetime.

ìI still fight with that sometimes,î she said, ìand Iím 71 years old. Itís in the back of my head: Donít bring too much attention to yourself. Itís OK if somebody else takes credit for what you did.î


Those words still cut, so she advises parents to do things differently. ìAdvocate for your kids. You have to protect your kids,î Knowles said. ìMake sure that the messages that theyíre giving your kids are ones that they can do anything they want to do and they do belong anywhere that they want to be.î

Itís exactly the message she imparted to her girls.

Pay attention to how you treat yourself

Your children are watching how you treat yourself, Knowles told me, noting that her loving mother, AgnÈz BeyincÈ, lived life in fear for her children as she tried to make sure they were not targets in the segregated US South.

But Knowles also watched her mother make exquisite outfits for all of her kids, and they were the best-dressed kids in town even though they were poor. (Knowles learned great lessons from her motherís work as a seamstress and ended up creating most of the outfits for Destinyís Child, Beyonceís singing group with Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams.)


ìAs poor as we were, we were always the sharpest kids and just took a lot of pride in fashion and how we looked and Ö I think it helped us not to know how poor we were,î Knowles said. ìI passed it on to my daughters Ö theyíre very talented at putting things together. They donít sew like I sew but they can put a button on, and they can put a hem in and take a dart in and that type of thing.î

Work against sibling rivalry
Knowles says she knew right away that BeyoncÈ had found her lifeís passion the first time she saw her daughter onstage. It was that obvious. But Knowles said her younger daughter could have done anything, and she didnít really want Solange to go into the music business.

ìI was terrified when BeyoncÈ turned around 10,î said Knowles, worried sheíd lose her children to their craft and that the work would create a wedge between the sisters.

According to Knowles, the kids in BeyoncÈís singing group would say to Solange every day, ìëBe quiet, Solange,í because she would try to choreograph (the group). You know sheís bossy, and she wanted to be involved.î


ìI started noticing that BeyoncÈ would allow them to talk to her like that,î she said. ìI saw a wall between them coming, and so I got them in therapy.î

While her family and community thought therapy could be problematic or even dangerous, she found a ìwonderfulî child therapist. As a result, the two sisters ìare now as close as they can be. No wedge will come between them.î

Knowles encourages other parents to do the same if they see an unhealthy sibling rivalry developing between your children.

Get screened for breast cancer
Knowles got diagnosed with breast cancer last year, and she struggled with the decision to mention it publicly or not. She decided to speak out so other people would also get screened, especially if theyíve missed a checkup or two or more.


ìYou get busy doing everything for everyone else,î she said, ìand everything else takes a priority over your health at some point in our lives, I think (for) women in particular, but men as well.î

ìI want to share it in hopes that that women would take a minute and say Ö Iím gonna go,î she added."," May 11, 2025",Health,Sara Sidner,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/11/health/tina-knowles-mother-wellness,,,,,,,,,,,,tina knowles remembers growing loving raucous family nine youngest seven children add cousins force reckoned whenever left house early age knowles says taught draw attention ‚Äúpretty pretty does‚Äù mom used say words quiet know place lucky us didn‚Äôt listen book tour new memoir ‚Äúmatriarch‚Äù oprah‚Äôs book club selection talked cnn‚Äôs offices new york learned childhood choices raising daughters beyonc√© solange knowles cnn mother‚Äôs day weekend here‚Äôs businesswoman fashion designer mother two famous entertainers world wanted share don‚Äôt limit children teaching kids seen heard common way parenting back ‚Äúmama tina‚Äù growing galveston texas segregation mom teachers catholic school adults around made clear role expected play knowles translated trying make small insignificant ‚Äî even though born big personality big feelings many opinions knowles simply couldn‚Äôt follow quiet rule quickly given nickname ‚Äúbadass tenie b‚Äù ‚Äúthat term endearment little‚Äù knowles told recent conversation ‚Äúthey used just say comes badass tenie b hyper talked back‚Äù now says recognizes willfulness hyper behavior stemmed attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd reflects ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt thing then‚Äù child tina knowles attended catholic school teachers negatively shaped view school child tina knowles attended catholic school teachers negatively shaped view school courtesy tina knowlespenguin random house knowles attended school nuns ruled roost said teachers told didn‚Äôt belong unsalvageable bad seed words punctured soul made hate going school ‚Äúthey thought best thing‚Äù knowles said hurt terribly run home tell mother understand mom never take side didn‚Äôt know mother working bone church get knowles siblings education experience school childhood community knowles said it‚Äôs important really think saying children labels can affect lifetime related article santa claus putting gifts christmas tree night use positive reinforcement instead threats child‚Äôs misbehavior experts say ‚Äúi still fight sometimes‚Äù said ‚Äúand i‚Äôm years old it‚Äôs back head don‚Äôt bring much attention it‚Äôs ok somebody else takes credit did‚Äù words still cut advises parents things differently ‚Äúadvocate kids protect kids‚Äù knowles said ‚Äúmake sure messages they‚Äôre giving kids ones can anything want belong anywhere want be‚Äù it‚Äôs exactly message imparted girls pay attention treat knowles talented seamstress continues follow fashion wearing gucci attends lacma artfilm gala los angeles november knowles talented seamstress continues follow fashion wearing gucci attends lacma artfilm gala los angeles november matt winkelmeyergetty images children watching treat knowles told noting loving mother agn√©z beyinc√© lived life fear children tried make sure targets segregated us south knowles also watched mother make exquisite outfits kids bestdressed kids town even though poor knowles learned great lessons mother‚Äôs work seamstress ended creating outfits destiny‚Äôs child beyonce‚Äôs singing group kelly rowland michelle williams ‚Äúas poor always sharpest kids just took lot pride fashion looked ‚Ä¶ think helped us know poor were‚Äù knowles said ‚Äúi passed daughters ‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre talented putting things together don‚Äôt sew like sew can put button can put hem take dart type thing‚Äù work sibling rivalry knowles says knew right away beyonc√© found life‚Äôs passion first time saw daughter onstage obvious knowles said younger daughter done anything didn‚Äôt really want solange go music business solange l beyonc√© perform onstage coachella valley music arts festival april solange l beyonc√© perform onstage coachella valley music arts festival april kevin mazurgetty images ‚Äúi terrified beyonc√© turned around ‚Äù said knowles worried she‚Äôd lose children craft work create wedge sisters according knowles kids beyonc√©‚Äôs singing group say solange every day ‚Äú‚Äòbe quiet solange‚Äô try choreograph group know she‚Äôs bossy wanted involved‚Äù ‚Äúi started noticing beyonc√© allow talk like that‚Äù said ‚Äúi saw wall coming got therapy‚Äù family community thought therapy problematic even dangerous found ‚Äúwonderful‚Äù child therapist result two sisters ‚Äúare now close can wedge come them‚Äù knowles encourages parents see unhealthy sibling rivalry developing children get screened breast cancer knowles got diagnosed breast cancer last year struggled decision mention publicly decided speak people also get screened especially they‚Äôve missed checkup two ‚Äúyou get busy everything everyone else‚Äù said ‚Äúand everything else takes priority health point lives think women particular men well‚Äù ‚Äúi want share hopes women take minute say ‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm gonna go‚Äù added
Did 8 Italian physicists make the perfect cacio e pepe? I tested their experiment to find out,"CNN
 ó 
Few things are as impressive to dinner party guests as a perfectly executed ‡ la minute pasta dish.

As a Roman-born foodie, I would argue that cacio e pepe, a Roman pasta recipe that is as delicious and simple as it is finicky, is a bold menu choice for the novice cook.

The name says it all: pasta, cacio (cheese) and pepe (pepper). Thatís it. Thatís the recipe.

ìThere is no margin for error with just pasta, Pecorino Romano cheese, and black pepper,î Michele Casadei Massari, CEO and executive chef of Lucciola Italian Restaurant in Manhattan, told CNN via email.

ìThe main challenge lies in achieving a stable emulsion: If the cheese is overheated or the starch-water balance is wrong, the sauce will separate,î Massari said.

When that happens, the pecorino forms a gloopy cheesy mess, sticking to everything but the noodles ó sad and naked.

So, how can one reliably avoid unpleasant dinnertime disasters? Either by practicing a lot ó and inevitably making mistakes in the process, as I have ó or by using science to guide the way.

Eight Italian physicists collaborated to crack the code of a foolproof cacio e pepe recipe, studying the properties of cheese, starch and water at different temperatures to learn how to replicate a flawless dish every time.

The study was published April 29 in the journal Physics of Fluids.

The magic trick? Adding a precise amount of cornstarch relative to the overall quantity of cheese used, to keep the dreaded clumps at bay.

When I first heard about the method, the Roman cuisine purist in me was skeptical.

Too many times, Iíve read cheat sheets for the perfect carbonara dish in which the solution to perfect, non-scrambled-egg sauce is to add cream (please, do not do this). In the interest of objectivity, I had to test the recipe myself and talk to these fellow Italians behind the research.

In a conversation in Italian, three of the study authors shared that the research came from their frustration for one too many cacio e pepe dishes gone wrong. Thanks to the groupís familiarity with the concept of ìliquid-liquid phase separation,î they knew how to investigate the problem scientifically.

ìAt some point, the eight of us were all at the Max Planck Institute in Dresden (Germany), some as PhD students, some as postdocs,î said study coauthor Daniel Maria Busiello, a statistical physicist at Italyís University of Padova. At that time, ìsomething weíd often do was cooking Italian recipes, not just for Italians, but for others as well.î

Making big batches of cacio e pepe to feed other hungry scientists turned out to be a near-impossible feat. ìThere were problems with controlling the temperature of the sauce and of the noodles, causing these clumps,î Busiello said.

ìI remember a time the dish came out inedible. Something clicked then,î said study coauthor Ivan Di Terlizzi, one of the groupís top cooks, and a statistical physicist at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden.

The physics of a pasta problem
Di Terlizzi approached fellow researcher Giacomo Bartolucci, now a biophysicist at the University of Barcelona in Spain, with a working theory about possible commonalities between the behavior of cacio e pepe sauce and that of aqueous solutions of proteins inside cells. Bartolucci had focused on phase separation and the aggregation of proteins for his doctoral research.

The scientists set out to understand whether the cheese and water in this recipe could be scientifically described as ìa system that undergoes phase separation at high temperatures,î in Busielloís words.

ìWe had a theoretical framework and a practical problem,î Busiello added.

Innovating on traditional Italian recipes, even on solid scientific grounds, is a high-risk endeavor. Given the touchy subject, the study authors are of course all Italians, by design.

ìIf we have to piss off a bunch of people, at least let it be eight Italians who did it,î Di Terlizzi said.

To investigate the behavior of cacio e pepe sauce under heat, the researchers conducted experiments recreating the cooking process in a controlled setup.

ìWe prepared small batches of sauce using precise amounts of cheese, starch, and water, and gradually heated them using a sous vide device to carefully control the temperature,î Di Terlizzi explained.

ìAt each stage, we took a small sample of the sauce, placed it in a petri dish and photographed it from above to observe how clumps formed. This allowed us to track how changes in temperature and ingredients affected the smoothness of the sauce.î

Avoiding the ëMozzarella phaseí
The researchers found that the concentration of starch in the sauce is the key factor influencing its stability. If the proportion of starch falls below 1% of the total cheese weight, the cheese will enter what the authors call the ìMozzarella phaseî ó in which clumps are inescapable and the dish is ruined ó at lower temperatures. A 2% to 3% starch-to-cheese ratio yields the best results.

In the recipe for two published in the study, the researchers used 5 grams (0.18 ounce) of cornstarch or potato starch dissolved in water, heated up gently to form a gel, then cooled down with more water before being blended with 200 grams (7 ounces) of pecorino cheese.

Sodium citrate, a common additive used to make smooth mac and cheese, also worked well in their recipe, although according to Di Terlizzi it lent the dish a slightly ìcheese singleî aftertaste.

The scientifically engineered pecorino cream can withstand temperature changes better than the classic cheese-starchy water mixture made with pasta cooking water and can even be reheated.

Temperature is in fact another key factor that can make or break the sauce, which has to do with how the proteins in the cheese behave when heated.

Writer Francesca Giuliani Hoffman said the more stable, smooth sauce in the scientifically optimized recipe she prepared at home meant the final mixing of the ingredients was less time-sensitive.

ìThe sauce is stable if created at low temperatures and the starch bonded with the proteins. If, after that happens, you expose the sauce to high temperatures, proteins can no longer interact,î Di Terlizzi said.

If the emulsion of cheese and starch happens at high temperatures though, ìthereís no guarantee that proteins will bond with other proteins, which causes the aggregation, before they bond with the starch.î

The scientifically optimized recipe will yield solid results for large batches of pasta, as the stable sauce will give you more flexibility dealing with a large volume of piping hot noodles, cooling down more slowly than a smaller batch of pasta would.

When trying the scientifically optimized recipe, donít throw away all the pasta cooking water! Youíll still need some of it in the final mixing of all ingredients (the ìmantecaturaî in Italian). Just be careful to let it cool down slightly.

Testing the physicistsí recipe
When I tested the recipe, the instructions felt straightforward, and the process was quick, though it required a few more steps than what Iím used to (such as forming the starch gel on the stove).

It was frankly odd to work with a pecorino cream that felt so smooth ó it almost reminded me of a jarred sauce. Nothing changes as far as the pepper goes. Just crack as much of it as youíd like and toast it in a pan to release its aroma.

My husband and I enjoyed the dish. It tasted great, and dealing with a pecorino cream that needs much less babying at the stove and allows for a much less time-sensitive mantecatura is a definite plus. Also, who doesnít love the idea of a cacio e pepe party for a crowd?

My only qualm is that knowing there was starch added in the sauce, my perception of the dishís mouthfeel was definitely skewed, but that wasnít the case for my husband.

As a proud Roman home cook, my pursuit of a perfect classic cacio e pepe will be a life-long experiment, but the scientifically optimized recipe exceeded my expectations and would be a good initiation for home cooks who have been put off by the dishís treachery thus far.

A chefís advice for the traditional dish
But what exactly makes the traditional way of making this dish, by emulsifying the cheese with pasta cooking water, so challenging?

Itís practically impossible to know just how much starch is naturally present in the pasta cooking water, so the success of the crucial emulsion is more of a gamble, but there are tricks to mitigate catastrophe.

One, coming from Massari, is to use less water to boil the pasta.

ìFor cacio e pepe, I recommend using about 6 to 8 cups of water for 7 ounces of pasta, which translates to a ratio closer to 1 part pasta to 6ñ7 parts water by weight ó significantly less than in traditional pasta cooking,î the chef said.

A classic rule of thumb for cooking pasta, according to Massari, is to use about 1 quart of water for every 3Ω ounces of pasta, and 2 teaspoons of salt.

The researchers, who used an arbitrary 10-to-1 ratio of water to pasta in their experiments, also said that reducing that volume of water by two-thirds generally concentrated the natural pasta starch to a safe degree.

Massari also recommends emulsifying the cheese and pasta water below 60 degrees Celsius (140 degrees Fahrenheit), which is in line with the new studyís findings on temperature.

ìI first create a cold cheese cream, using finely grated Pecorino and a small amount of the pastaís starchy cooking water, blending until smooth. Then, I toss the pasta off the heat with the cream and freshly cracked black pepper, adding extra water to adjust the texture,î Massari said. ìThe result should be a silky, cohesive sauce that clings beautifully to every strand of pasta, not a broken or heavy coating.î

ìThe natural starch from properly handled pasta is more than sufficient to achieve a creamy, stable, and authentic sauce without compromising the nutritional integrity of the dish,î Massari added.

Another chefís trick to buy you some time while attempting the recipe the traditional way is ìpasta regenerationî ó which involves partially cooking the pasta for about 70% of its time, immediately shocking it in ice water to stop gelatinization and finishing it later before serving.

ìThis method preserves al dente texture while enhancing the final release of surface starch, which is crucial for stabilizing delicate emulsions,î Massari explained.

Celebrating with their tested recipe
The researchers said their scientifically optimized recipe has surged to meme status, online and offline.

ìSome social media users were hypercritical about the recipe we proposed, despite it being used before in prestigious restaurants,î Di Terlizzi told CNN. ìOverall, I can say that excitement prevailed, especially in the scientific community,î he added.

ìWe wonít say we invented the definitive method,î Di Terlizzi said, but this method will save you from ruining good, expensive and hard-to-source pecorino cheese.

For the researchers, thatís personal: ìWeíre in Germany. We have that shipped to us all the way from Italy. We canít just buy it at the store every day,î Di Terlizzi said. ìSo, when the dish turns out badly, that bothers us.î

A big pasta dinner celebrated the publication of the paper, with the researchers preparing at least 4 pounds of pasta for a crowd.

ìWe were on pins and needles because our diners all knew about the experiment ó but it worked perfectly,î Busiello said.

Bartolucci added, ìThat was our trial by fire.î

The scientifically optimized cacio e pepe recipe we tested
This is CNNís summary of the recipe presented in the study. You can find Pecorino Romano DOP ó which stands for Protected Designation of Origin, a certification of a productís origin and quality assigned by the Italian government and the European Union ó and tonnarelli pasta at Italian grocers and online specialty stores.

Serves 2

Ingredients

ï Salt

ï 5 grams (2 teaspoons) cracked black peppercorns, plus more for serving

ï 5 grams (2 teaspoons) cornstarch or potato starch

ï 200 grams (1 Ω cups, firmly packed) pregrated Pecorino Romano DOP (such as Fulvi, Locatelli or Cello), plus more for serving

ï 300 grams (10.6 ounces) pasta, preferably tonnarelli (spaghetti or rigatoni also work well)

Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.

2. While the water comes to a boil, add peppercorns in a single layer to a dry pan over medium-low heat. Toast until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove pepper from heat immediately.

3. Make the starch gel. In a small saucepan, dissolve the cornstarch by whisking it into 50 grams (3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon) cold water. Heat the mixture gently over low heat until it thickens and turns nearly clear. Remove the starch gel from heat and whisk in 100 grams (6 æ tablespoons) water to cool. The mixture will return to a liquid state.

4. Make the pecorino cream. Add the starchy water, grated cheese and peppercorns to the bowl of a food processor and pulse to combine until a smooth cream forms.

5. Cook the pasta according to the package directions until al dente, reserving 237 milliliters (1 cup) of pasta water before draining. Drain the pasta and let cool for up to 1 minute.

6. Mix the pasta with the sauce, ensuring even coating, and adjust the consistency by gradually adding pasta water as needed. Keep the sauce slightly runny as it tends to thicken as it cools. If needed, the dish can withstand gentle reheating (up to 80 or 90 C, 176 to 194 F) to reach serving temperature.

7. Sprinkle with additional grated cheese and pepper and serve immediately.

Chef Michele Casadei Massariís Cacio e Pepe
ìI recommend using high-quality spaghettoni pasta made from durum wheat semolina, bronze-extruded and slow-dried at low temperatures,î Massari told CNN. ìI prefer using Matt, a heritage durum wheat cultivated mainly in Puglia and Sicily.î

You can find matt spaghettoni, Sarawak black peppercorns and Pecorino Romano DOP at online specialty stores.

Serves 2

Ingredients

ï Sea salt, preferably coarse Sicilian sea salt

ï 5 grams (1 teaspoon) freshly cracked Sarawak black peppercorns, plus more for serving

ï 100 grams (1 cup, firmly packed) pregrated Pecorino Romano DOP (such as Fulvi, Locatelli or Cello), plus more for serving

ï 200 grams (7 ounces) spaghettoni, preferably matt durum wheat spaghettoni

Directions

1. Bring 6 to 8 cups of lightly salted water to a boil in a large pot. Toast the black pepper in a dry pan over medium-low heat until fragrant. Remove pepper from heat immediately.

2. Cook the spaghettoni according to the package directions until slightly al dente, reserving 237 grams (1 cup) of cooking liquid while itís cooking.

3. While the pasta is cooking, prepare a cold emulsion by mixing grated Pecorino Romano with a small ladle of warm pasta water (ideally under 60 C, or 140 F) in a medium bowl until it forms a creamy base.

4. Drain the pasta slightly al dente, then transfer it to the pan with the pepper.

5. Toss the pasta with the Pecorino cream, gradually adjusting with more pasta water to create a glossy, smooth sauce that perfectly coats the noodles. Add more black pepper and cheese before serving. Serve immediately.

Parkinsons disease prevention may begin at the dinner table,"Eating about a dozen servings of ultraprocessed food each day could more than double your risk of developing Parkinsonís disease, according to a new study.

A single serving in the study was 8 ounces of diet or sugar-sweetened soda, a single hot dog, one slice of packaged cake, a mere tablespoon of ketchup or 1 ounce of potato chips ó a typical small bag of chips is 1.5 ounces.

Eating more ultraprocessed food ups the risk of premature death, study finds

ìOur research shows that eating too much processed food, like sugary sodas and packaged snacks, might be speeding up early signs of Parkinsonís disease,î said senior study author Dr. Xiang Gao, a distinguished professor and dean of the Institute of Nutrition at Fudan University in Shanghai, China, in a statement.

This latest study is part of the ìgrowing evidence that diet might influence the development of Parkinsonís disease,î Gao said.


While the study found that people who ate more ultraprocessed foods tended to report more early symptoms, it did not find a direct increase in the risk of Parkinsonís disease itself, said Dr. Daniel van Wamelen, a clinical senior lecturer in neuroscience at Kingís College London. He was not involved in the new research.

ìThe study did not track whether participants were diagnosed with Parkinsonís later on,î van Wamelen said in a statement. ìThat said, having more of these symptoms suggests a higher risk over time.î

Brain health begins ëat the dinner tableí
The study analyzed years of health and diet data on nearly 43,000 participants of the Nursesí Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, two studies in the United States that have been gathering information on health behaviors for decades. The average age of people in the study was 48, and none had Parkinsonís disease at the beginning of the study. All self-reported what they ate every few years ó a limitation of the new research as participants may not have remembered their food intake accurately.

Ultraprocessed foods measured by the study included artificially or sugar-sweetened beverages; condiments, sauces and spreads; packaged sweets snacks or desserts; yogurt or dairy-based desserts; breads and cereals; and packaged savory snacks.


The study found a link between early signs of Parkinsonís disease and all types of ultraprocessed foods except breads and cereals ó a finding that indicates an underlying feature among most classes of ultraprocessed foods that may explain the results, the study said.

One reason could be ultraprocessed foods typically have less dietary fiber, protein and micronutrients ó but do have added sugar, salt, and saturated or trans fats, the study said. Ultraprocessed foods also may impact the balance of flora in the gut, while additives may increase inflammation, free radicals and neuron death, the study said.

ìWith a sample size exceeding 42,800 participants and a long follow-up period up to 26 years, this study stands out not only for its power but also for its methodological rigor,î wrote the authors of a corresponding editorial published with the study.

The editorial was coauthored by Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, an associate professor of clinical neurology at Columbia University in New York City, and dietitian Maria Maraki, an assistant professor of sports medicine and exercise biology at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece. Neither were involved in the new research.


ìThe prevention of neurodegenerative diseases may begin at the dinner table,î they wrote. ìExcessive UPF consumption not only is a risk factor for metabolic diseases but may also accelerate neurodegenerative processes and associated symptoms.î

Early symptoms appear years before motor function declines
In the new study, published Wednesday in the journal Neurology, researchers looked at the prodromal stage of Parkinsonís disease ó early signals that appear years to decades before the tremors, stiff muscles, slow gait and changes in posture that are hallmark symptoms of Parkinsonís.

Body pain, constipation, signs of depression, changes in the ability to smell or see colors, and excessive daytime sleepiness can all be early signs of Parkinsonís disease, according to the Parkinsonís Foundation.


An extremely unusual sleep disorder, in which people can move during REM, or the rapid eye movement stage of sleep, is also a key early sign, according to research. The body is typically paralyzed during REM sleep so it cannot get up and act out any dreams.

The study found that people who ate about 11 servings a day of ultraprocessed food ó compared to people who only ate three ó had a 2.5-fold greater likelihood of exhibiting three or more of the early signs of Parkinsonís.

In addition, eating more ultraprocessed foods was tied to an increased risk for nearly all symptoms except constipation, according to the study. This finding held true even after researchers accounted for other factors, such as age, physical activity and smoking, that might impact the results.


ìParkinsonís is an incurable disease,î Gao said in an email. ìIn our previous study based on the same populations used for the current analysis, we found that a healthy dietary pattern and physical activity could slow the disease progression.

8 activewear brands you should add to your workout wardrobe,"CNN
 ó 
The increasing popularity of stylish, trendy athletic wear has made ¸ber-comfortable clothing something thatís not just for the gym. Itís infiltrated all corners of culture, from high fashion runways to the offices of Silicon Valley executives ó and really, itís appropriate for any occasion when you just want to be comfortable.

A key thing to keep in mind when searching for your next piece of activewear is the type of activity or exercise you prefer: Whether youíre a runner, yogi, lifter, cyclist or anything else, thereís a trendy athleisure brand out there for you. We were able to test some of these pieces hands-on so we could really see where each brand shines bright. So if youíre ready to upgrade your closet and kill those workouts in style, check out these eight activewear brands that we absolutely love ó from established ones to newer direct-to-consumer options.

Alo Yoga
Alo Yoga was created in 2007 as an activewear brand specifically for yoga lovers, but it has since evolved into one beloved by everyone from the barre-obsessed and Pilates loyalists to celebrities as a street style option. And thereís a really good reason for that.

aloleggings
The brandís super-soft and comfortable activewear is probably the most luxurious-feeling gym clothing Iíve ever worn. It may not be the best option for someone who runs marathons or works with heavy weights, but it provides a little luxury if you prefer lower-impact exercises like yoga or barre. When it comes to the leggings, both the 7/8 High-Waist Airbrush Legging ($78; aloyoga.com) and the High-Waist Airlift Legging ($118; aloyoga.com) are extremely soft, comfortable and flattering.

The High-Waist Airbrush Legging is probably Alo Yogaís most classic legging. There are no side seams, and itís made from the brandís signature Airbrush fabric that features moisture-wicking antimicrobial technology. Itís the perfect option to take you from the gym to just about anywhere and has been spotted on celebrities like Gigi Hadid. The High-Waist Airlift Legging feels like a second skin; itís buttery and sleek while still supportive. Theyíre super high-waisted, making them a great choice to pair with a whole range of crop tops or sports bras.

Alo Yoga tops
Alo Yoga tops Alo Yoga
While we didnít test any of Aloís current tops, weíve worn some of its older long-sleeve products, which felt warm and lightweight. The brand also has tons of other tops, including the bestselling Real Bra Tank ($72; aloyoga.com), that can keep you supported and stylish through all your workouts. This tank has a built-in shelf bra that provides light to medium support so you can go straight from yoga class to the cafÈ around the corner without skipping a beat.

Working out in these pieces, and in Alo Yogaís products in general, definitely feels a little more special than wearing your typical workout clothes. And though theyíre probably not the most supportive workout options on the market and better suited for lower-impact activities, we can guarantee that theyíll garner tons of compliments both outside and inside the studio.

Girlfriend Collective
Girlfriend Collective is a brand that prioritizes slow fashion ó which means investing time and energy ó to produce clothing thatís more ethical and easier on the planet. Take the Compressive High-Rise Legging, for example, Girlfriendís signature legging thatís made from 25 recycled water bottles. And though many synthetic fabrics (like nylon and polyester) are made from plastic, Girlfriend chooses materials ìthat would otherwise clog landfills and threaten wildlife.î

girlfriendlead
But youíre not sacrificing quality when you shop at Girlfriend. In fact, itís quite the opposite. The Compressive High-Rise Legging ($68; girlfriend.com) and Paloma Bra ($38; girlfriend.com) are some of the most inexpensive options on this list, which makes their super-high-quality feel that much more impressive.

The Compressive High-Rise Leggings really do some incredible work when it comes to lifting your backside. Theyíre also extremely high-waisted, which is great if you donít want to worry about pulling up your leggings during a workout. Both the leggings and the Paloma Bra are sweat-resistant and comfortable in warmer environments, though theyíre not the most lightweight, which we actually prefer for everyday wear.

The Paloma Bra is fairly long as well, so if youíre buying these two pieces together ó which we highly recommend, because everyone will be asking where you got your adorable set ó your whole stomach wonít be exposed. Another interesting element is the lack of visible branding; there are no loud logos on the back of the leggings, which we found refreshing.

girlfriend2
The best part is the customization thatís available, both in terms of fit and style. The Paloma Bra is available in sizes XS through XXXL, and the Compressive High-Rise Legging runs from sizes XXS to 6XL, with the additional option of choosing from three inseam lengths. Yes for inclusivity! And when it comes to colors, thereís absolutely something for everyone.

One of our favorite elements of Girlfriendís better-for-the-planet philosophy is exemplified in the ReGirlfriend program, which encourages customers to send in old Compressive bras, leggings and shorts for a $15 store credit. Girlfriend then recycles the old materials into new ones, which helps close the loop on creating more waste. So maybe there isnít too much harm in ordering a piece in every single color?

Lululemon
If youíre looking for brand recognition, youíll be hard-pressed to find a piece of activewear more ubiquitous than Lululemon leggings. Popular with yogis, runners and influencers alike, athletic wear from the popular brand is famed for its fashionable look and unbelievably soft materials.

Lululemonís Align Leggings ($98; lululemon.com) pretty much have their own cult following, thanks to buttery soft Nulu fabric and their flattering shape. If you havenít splurged on a pair of Lululemon leggings yet, the Align collection might just be the place to start. Not only does it include leggings, but it also features bike shorts, super-high-rise options, wide-leg pants and even tops perfect for all types of exercises.

Lululemon

But Lululemon offers so much more than the Align collection, with pieces for any sort of lifestyle, whether youíre going on runs every day or just want some comfy clothes to lounge around in. Its series of sports bras are nearly as popular as its leggings, and its Energy Bra line is fit to handle any workout. Available in cup sizes B through D, these versatile sports bras come in high neck and long line options too.

If youíre embracing the WFH life, Lululemon has tons of oversize, comfy options for you as well. From cozy hoodies and sweaters to luxurious joggers and pants, you can find anything you need to snuggle up indoors all day.

Lululemon is one of the most popular brands in the athleisure space, and for good reason. Its wide selection of stylish, comfortable and versatile apparel will carry you through nearly any workout.

FP Movement
Free Peopleís activewear collection features a uniquely boho style that sets it apart from other brands. From the wide range of distinctive colors to stretchier, looser fabrics and cuts, the little details in the brandís pieces make them a fun step up from your typical athleisure basics.

freepeople1
The playful element of the brandís aesthetic is apparent in its Good Karma set, which includes the Square Neck Good Karma Bra ($48; freepeople.com) and High-Rise 7/8 Length Good Karma Leggings ($78; freepeople.com). Both pieces are available in a huge range of colors, from wardrobe-necessary neutrals to bolder, brighter options like neon yellow, tropical pink and a super-bright blue.

Theyíre made from a combination of spandex and nylon, and as a result theyíre incredibly stretchy and body-hugging ó which is important since the pieces are available in only two sizes. While they held up well during our workout classes, we found ourselves turning to them outside of exercising as well. These pieces easily double as everyday clothing, and the wider waistband on the leggings lends a slightly more dressed-up look.

When it comes to special little touches, the High-Rise 7/8 Length Youíre a Peach Leggings ($98; freepeople.com) absolutely won our hearts. To start, theyíre the perfect leggings to work out in. Theyíre thick enough to be completely squatproof ó no need to worry about your underwear showing through ó and theyíre made of the type of reliable material that you donít have to worry about ripping.

freepeople2
The 7/8 length is perfect even for those who are petite, and the ruched detail adds a fun touch. The leggings have a high waist that sits perfectly, and the real showstopper? The light-reflective accents that both keep you visible if youíre working out at night and accentuate your curves.

And finally, the Hit the Slopes Fleece Jacket ($148; freepeople.com) is a unique and stylish take on a typical fleece jacket. The button snaps are really high quality, and the multiple zippered pockets mean you never have to bring a bag or purse to the gym again.

Carbon38
Carbon38 both curates super-stylish activewear and creates its own line of products. And when it comes to head-turning, high fashion-inspired pieces that will have the trendy women in your life in awe of a cropped sweater, Carbon38 is absolutely your destination.

CARBON381
The signature High Rise 7/8 Takara Legging ($105; carbon38.com) is something we havenít really seen before. The material is sleek, with a glossy finish that isnít quite as dramatic as it looks in pictures on the site (so no worries if it looks a bit intimidating in the image ó itís gorgeous but not totally liquidy). We paired it with the Cami Bra ($68; carbon38.com), which matches perfectly, for probably the most fashionable workout set weíve ever seen, let alone tried on.

The material is compressive, and the large waistband on the High Rise 7/8 Takara Legging is super comfortable. Again, this might not be the activewear you run a marathon in, but itís perfect for meeting friends for lunch. And thatís what distinguishes Carbon38 to us as an activewear brand ó itís really a fashion brand that uses activewear as a way to incorporate comfy but trendy pieces into your everyday life.

carbon382
The Crop Tank ($39; carbon38.com) is, simply put, one of the softest tank tops weíve ever tried. Itís the perfect cropped length to pair with high-waisted leggings, and just sheer enough to show off whatever cute sports bra you have on underneath.

Spanx
Spanx started out with shapewear, but since its beginnings, the brand has expanded and now makes stellar leggings and activewear as well.

Its Faux Leather Leggings ($98; spanx.com) are immensely popular, and itís easy to see why. We tried them out for ourselves and adore how stretchy, breathable and stylish they are. They have a high-waisted design and contoured waistband, and theyíre center seam-free ó so whether youíre out running errands or doing some yoga at home, youíll be comfortable and chic.

If youíre looking for more traditional activewear, Spanx has got you covered there too. The brand offers sports bras, bike shorts, more leggings and even an exercise skort. The Get Moving Skort ($72; spanx.com) is another one of Spanxís most popular items, equipped with a built-in liner that wicks away sweat and moisture. Plus, it even has pockets so you can keep your phone and keys nearby when youíre out working up a sweat.

The brand also offers a wide range of sizes and inseams, including petite and tall fits, which is a huge bonus if you can never find a pair of leggings that fit just right. So if you want ultimate comfort and style during even your hardest workouts, look no further than Spanxís collection of leggings, tops and other essentials.

Sweaty Betty
When it comes to sweatproof activewear for anyone who loves a good workout, Sweaty Betty is the winner in our book. The brand has been around for over 20 years now, and in that time it has absolutely nailed apparel thatís both ideal for the studio or gym and perfect for everyday wear.

sweatybetty1
We wore the Power Mesh 7/8 Workout Leggings, which have since been replaced with a meshless pair called the Power 7/8 Workout Leggings ($100; sweatybetty.com). The pair we tried were made from a sleek fabric that feels like itís optimized for performance. They were extremely sweatproof, and the material almost gets more comfortable as you work out. The current Power Workout Leggings are made from the same material.

Something to note, however, is that the Power 7/8 Workout Leggings arenít high-waisted, which makes them a great option if you prefer to wear leggings with a longer tank top as opposed to a sports bra or crop top. Weíre a big fan of the back zip pocket, which (though it didnít fit our iPhone XR) is the perfect size for keys, a credit card and some cash.

sweatybetty2
We also tried the Athlete Seamless Workout Tank ($48; sweatybetty.com) and the Stamina Sports Bra ($40; sweatybetty.com), and the Athlete Seamless Workout Tank is exactly what it sounds like: a super-versatile tank ideal for just about any activity we can think of. Itís sweat-wicking, flattering and works perfectly with any pair of leggings.

While some gym clothes sort of hug your curves and accentuate them, we found that all the Sweaty Betty products were more compressing and really held everything in. For this reason, we imagine the leggings and tank top would be great for runners, boxers and those who prefer higher-impact workouts.

The Stamina Sports Bra is designed to offer medium support up to a C cup, and we found it ideal for lower-impact activity. That being said, itís a sports bra so comfortable you can wear it to the gym and keep it on all day long. Itís not restrictive or bulky, and it paired perfectly with the Athlete Seamless Workout Tank. The pieces we tried performed so well during sweaty workouts and still felt clean and lightweight post-sweat sesh.

Outdoor Voices
Outdoor Voices is a brand that has completely embraced all things athleisure as a lifestyle. It stresses the idea of ìfreeing fitness from performanceî and believes activity can be a part of anyoneís everyday life ó and its activewear reflects that.

Outdoor Voices carries a wide range of activewear for different types of activity. Our absolute favorite piece from the collection is the Exercise Dress ($100; outdoorvoices.com), which weíve written about in depth before. In many ways, it exemplifies everything that Outdoor Voices has nailed as an activewear brand: Itís super versatile, great for activity that intertwines with your everyday life (like hiking, jogging, walking with friends or biking) and brings something playful, simple and unique to the activewear space.

ov1
In true Outdoor Voices fashion, itís not about performance ó itís about comfortable, functional pieces that work with whatever your lifestyle is.

In terms of more traditional workout gear, we tested the Doing Things Bra ($58; outdoorvoices.com) and found it to be comfortable and supportive, though it wasnít completely sweatproof in our experience. During a barre class, we had some sweat gather in the middle of the sports bra and show through. So we would definitely recommend this for outdoor or more casual activity where you wonít be sweating heavily.",13-Jan-21,health, Noelle

Florida becomes second state in US to ban fluoride in public drinking water,"Florida has become the second state in the nation to ban the addition of fluoride to public drinking water.

On Thursday, Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the Florida Farm Bill, which includes language banning the use of any additive in a public water system that does not meet the new definition of a ìwater quality additiveî: a chemical or substance used in public water to specifically address drinking water standards, contaminants or quality.

ìYes, use fluoride for your teeth, thatís fine. But forcing it into the water supply is basically forced medication on people,î DeSantis said. ìThey donít have a choice. Youíre taking that away from them.î

More than 70% of Floridians who use community water systems receive fluoridated water, according to Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, who issued guidance in November recommending against community water fluoridation, citing its potential health effects.

What to know about fluoride in drinking water

Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral thatís found in soil, rocks and water to varying degrees. It is also a byproduct of fertilizer production. On the recommendation of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, many cities have added fluoride to their treated drinking water for decades to help protect teeth from cavities.


The CDC reiterated its faith in the health benefits of fluoride in 2015, naming water fluoridation one of the ì10 Greatest Public Health Achievements of the 21st Century.î The ADA has also emphasized that ìeighty years of community water fluoridation at optimal levels has proven to be safe and effective at reducing tooth decay to improve oral health.î

However, research has showed that exposure to fluoridated water during pregnancy is associated with increased neurobehavioral problems in children, and a federal review concluded that higher levels are linked with lower IQ in kids.

Utahís ban on fluoride in public water is a simple change that raises complicated new health risks, experts say


US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pledged to roll back CDC recommendations that fluoride be added to municipal drinking water and has promised that a panel of experts will review the guidelines and make new recommendations.


Kennedy canít formally prevent communities from adding fluoride to their drinking water, but some states and cities have followed his lead. In March, Utah became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water.

The US Food and Drug Administration also said this week it is starting the process to remove prescription fluoride tablets and drops from the market. Theyíre typically prescribed for babies and children who are at high risk of tooth decay because they drink water that doesnít contain added fluoride."," May 16, 2025",health,Katherine Dillinger,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/15/health/florida-fluoride-ban,,,,,,,,,,,,florida become second state nation ban addition fluoride public drinking water thursday gov ron desantis signed florida farm bill includes language banning use additive public water system meet new definition ‚Äúwater quality additive‚Äù chemical substance used public water specifically address drinking water standards contaminants quality ‚Äúyes use fluoride teeth that‚Äôs fine forcing water supply basically forced medication people‚Äù desantis said ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt choice you‚Äôre taking away them‚Äù floridians use community water systems receive fluoridated water according florida surgeon general dr joseph ladapo issued guidance november recommending community water fluoridation citing potential health effects related article datafluoridefinaljpg know fluoride drinking water fluoride naturally occurring mineral that‚Äôs found soil rocks water varying degrees also byproduct fertilizer production recommendation us centers disease control prevention world health organization many cities added fluoride treated drinking water decades help protect teeth cavities cdc reiterated faith health benefits fluoride naming water fluoridation one ‚Äú greatest public health achievements st century‚Äù ada also emphasized ‚Äúeighty years community water fluoridation optimal levels proven safe effective reducing tooth decay improve oral health‚Äù however research showed exposure fluoridated water pregnancy associated increased neurobehavioral problems children federal review concluded higher levels linked lower iq kids related article dissected human teeth displayed office dentist dr james bekker april salt lake city utah ap photohannah schoenbaum utah‚Äôs ban fluoride public water simple change raises complicated new health risks experts say us health human services secretary robert f kennedy jr pledged roll back cdc recommendations fluoride added municipal drinking water promised panel experts review guidelines make new recommendations kennedy can‚Äôt formally prevent communities adding fluoride drinking water states cities followed lead march utah became first state ban fluoride public drinking water us food drug administration also said week starting process remove prescription fluoride tablets drops market they‚Äôre typically prescribed babies children high risk tooth decay drink water doesn‚Äôt contain added fluoride
"Lawmakers press Kennedy on mass cuts, canceled medical research","Lawmakers repeatedly pressed US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy on canceled medical research and mass layoffs during Wednesday hearings on Trump administration proposals that could lead to even broader cuts.

Democrats on the House Appropriations Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies subcommittee repeatedly asked the secretary to explain cuts this year to health care programs, medical research and staffing before discussing a 2026 budget that would shrink the health agencies further. Kennedy also testified before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on Wednesday afternoon.

Kennedy insisted he would spend the funds that Congress appropriated in the 2026 budget according to law. But Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee, including ranking member Steny Hoyer and health subcommittee ranking member Rosa DeLauro, were focused on the agencyís spending this year, for budgets already authorized.

ìWe have to really keep a clear line here between a questionable proposal for ë26 and what is going on right now against the legislation that we have passed and that has been signed into law,î DeLauro said.

Trump administration cut $2.7 billion in NIH research funding through March, Senate committee minority report says

The administrationís cancellation of National Institutes of Health grants amounted to $2.7 billion in eliminated research, much higher than previous estimates, according to a report issued by Democrats on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on Tuesday.


In a post on X on Tuesday, HHS called the report ìunequivocally falseî and said it was politically motivated.

The secretary defended HHS funding and job cuts in the House subcommtitee hearing, saying that the slashes had reduced redundancy and that the proposed 2026 budget would streamline programs further.

But he also seemed to distance himself from the eliminations led by the US Department of Government Efficiency and said he had protected certain programs, including HeadStart.

ìThere were many instances where I said ëThat would hurt us,í î he told the House committee.

Questions on vaccination
Kennedy also told House lawmakers Wednesday that Americans should not take advice from him on vaccinations.


ìMy opinions on vaccines are irrelevant,î he said. ìEverybody should make that decision. I seem like Iím being evasive, but I donít think people should be taking advice, medical advice, from me.î

The comments came after Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wisconsin, asked Kennedy whether he would vaccinate his children against measles today. ìProbably for measles,î the secretary answered before adding that vaccination is a personal choice.

Pocan followed up with questions about whether Kennedy would vaccinate his children against chickenpox and polio today. Kennedy noted that chickenpox shots are not required in Europe and said again he did not want to be seen as advising families.

ìWhat weíre trying to do is to lay out the pros and cons accurately, as we understand them,î he said.

Lawmaker asks RFK Jr. if heíd vaccinate his kids

Kennedy has previously disclosed that his children received the recommended childhood schedule of vaccines when they were younger. As founder of the nonprofit Childrenís Health Defense, he has also criticized that schedule and claimed that the side effects of certain vaccines ó including unproven links to autism ó outweigh their benefits.


The secretary announced in April that health agencies would start a massive research and testing effort to distill the causes of autism, citing ìenvironmental toxinsî and other exposures.

Efforts to tackle racial disparities
In his opening statement at the House subcommittee hearing, Kennedy said that one of the top priorities for the agencyís budget was to ìeliminate DEI funding and redirect resources toward real poverty reduction.î

Democratic Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey pushed him on the topic, highlighting vast racial disparities in maternal mortality in the US and other health issues.


ìFew things enrage me more than the racist attacks I see this administration carrying out by embarking on an ignorant crusade to rid the government of any programs that are working to improve the lives of Black Americans,î Watson Coleman said. ìThe administration has moved to ban the words Black, race, bias, minority, oppression, prejudice, discrimination, disparity and racism. Any grant application on federal programs that include these words had them immediately stripped.î

HHS cuts 10,000 employees in major overhaul of health agencies

These actions are an attempt ìto legitimize racial discrimination,î she said, and low-income minorities will suffer the consequences most.

ìIt should not be controversial to make right a health care system that was not built to help people like me, to take my concerns, my pain, my health very seriously in this country,î Watson Coleman said. ìHow exactly will HHS banning the words that we use to describe ourselves make us healthier?î


Kennedy said that President Donald Trump has a vision for a ìcolorblind administration,î akin to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.ís ideals.

ìThe commitment is there. Weíre just reorganizing,î he said.

But he balked when Watson Coleman pressured him for rationale behind eliminating a program to help low-income households with their energy bills to have heat in the winter and stay cool in the summer: the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP.

ìMy time has expired,î Kennedy said.


ìWell then, so has your legitimacy,î Watson Coleman said.

Only when prompted to follow up did Kennedy offer a brief explanation, saying that the administrationís broader energy policy aims to bring energy costs down in general.

ìIf it doesnít happen, then Congress is welcome ñ and they should ñ appropriate the money for LIHEAP, and I will spend it,î Kennedy said. îI already allocated $400 million from LIHEAP during the last 100 days, and I will continue to do and get that funding to the people who need it in this country if the fuel costs do not go down.î

Lead program cuts
Kennedy suggested at the Senate hearing that experts in the US Centers for Disease Control and Preventionís lead poisoning prevention program were fired in error during the agencyís sweeping cuts in April.


During questioning by Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, on the impact that the lead program cuts might have on a lead contamination crisis in Milwaukee public schools, Kennedy agreed that childhood lead poisoning is ìan extremely significant concern.î

Baldwin then asked, ìDo you intend to eliminate this branch at CDC? Yes or no?î

ìNo, we do not,î Kennedy said.

Itís the second time Kennedy has suggested that lead experts at the CDC were cut in error. When asked during an appearance in April about cuts to the program, he responded, ìThere are some programs that are being cut that are being reinstated. I believe thatís one of them.î


An HHS spokesperson later said that the CDCís lead program wouldnít be reinstated but that the work would continue through a different CDC office, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.

However, experts in the CDCís lead program have not been rehired, according to Dr. Eric Svendsen, who was director of the CDCís Division of Environmental Health Science and Practice, which included the lead poisoning prevention program.

The entire division and all of its programs were cut during the April 1 layoffs. ìWe are all still RIFd,î Svendsen confirmed Wednesday.

Asked for clarification Wednesday, an agency official told CNN, ìAs HHS finalizes its detailed reorganization plans, the Department will be looking into all strategic programs and priorities for the Secretary and the nation. The work of this program will continue.î

Kennedy has reinstated some other workers at CDC. In an exchange with Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington earlier Wednesday, Kennedy said that he had reinstated 328 workers with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in Morgantown, West Virginia, and another site. Those offices worked on mine safety and on health issues in first responders after the response to the September 11 attacks, he said.


ìThe work on mine safety will continue,î Kennedy said. ìWe understand itís critically important function. And I did not want to see it end.î

Murray said other NIOSH workers, including those at an office in Spokane, Washington, have not been reinstated, however.

ìI would just say you canít fire 90% of the people and assume the work gets done,î she said.

Micah Niemeier-Walsh, vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3840, representing NIOSH employees in Cincinnati, said in a statement Wednesday that ìSome NIOSH employees have been reinstated, however, many critical functions of NIOSH remain negatively impacted by the Reductions in Force. Ö The union is determined to continue to advocate for full reinstatement of all NIOSH employees. All NIOSH programs are important for the health and safety of working peoeple in this country.î


Some workers at the US Food and Drug Administration have also had their firings reversed, including staffers handling Freedom of Information Act requests, those who negotiate user fees and some laboratory staff.

Additionally, more than a dozen scientists at the FDAís Moffett Lab in Illinois focusing on food safety had their RIF notices reversed, according to a person familiar with the situation who declined to be named because theyíre not authorized to speak on behalf of the agency.

Other attendees sat through the hearing with large stickers on their clothing saying ìAnti-vax, Anti-Science, Anti-Americanî next to an image of Kennedy.

Kennedy resumed his prepared remarks after the protestors exited.

ìLet me be clear,î he said, ìwe intend to make the Trump HHS not just the most effective but also the most compassionate in US history.î

"After NIH staffing cuts, cancer patient in clinical trial worries she may lose crucial time","With tWith the future of her cancer treatment in limbo, Natalie Phelps doesnít know how much longer she can wait.

Last month, after months of seeking treatment options for her colorectal cancer, the 43-year-old mother of two was accepted into an ongoing study at the National Institutes of Health. She thought the research would allow her to receive an experimental immunotherapy ñ but she now faces an excruciating wait and an equally excruciating choice.

First, her tumor must grow to at least 1 centimeter in size in order to receive treatment, she said. But even after she meets that criteria, an abrupt reduction in the NIH workforce means her treatment will take much longer to develop than initially expected. Sheís worried that that extra time may make a huge difference in her health.

The Trump administration has been conducting a review of funding and a restructuring of the US Department of Health and Human Services, resulting in massive waves of job cuts across federal health agencies under HHS, including the NIH, the nationís medical research agency.

Immunotherapy helps certain cancer patients avoid surgery: ëWe hope this is the futureí

Part of the HHS transformation involves decreasing the NIH workforce by about 1,200 ìby centralizing procurement, human resources, and communications across its 27 institutes and centers,î according to the Trump administration. The administration announced in late March that the HHS restructuring would save taxpayers $1.8 billion per year through an overall reduction of about 10,000 full-time employees.


Phelps said that some of the scientists working on her NIH trial were among the cuts.

Phelps was diagnosed with stage IV colorectal cancer in 2020, at age 38. She was nearly eight months pregnant at the time and originally thought her symptoms ñ abdominal pain, irregular bowel movements and mucus in her stool ñ were probably due to pregnancy or hemorrhoids. But as her symptoms worsened, she had a colonoscopy that found a tumor in her rectum. Further testing confirmed that it was cancer and that it had spread to her liver.

Phelps has had surgery to remove the initial tumor, radiation therapy, three liver surgeries and 48 rounds of chemotherapy. Yet the cancer has continued to spread, she said, which is why she has been eager to try immunotherapy through the NIH trial ñ and is worried about the wait.

Trial delay ëcould cost them their lifeí
Immunotherapy is a form of cancer treatment that harnesses a personís own immune cells to target and fight the disease. The NIH trial specifically involves a T-cell receptor-based therapy in which Phelpsí immune cells were collected through a blood draw, she said. Once her tumor grows to meet the criteria, the cells will be engineered to target her cancer, she said.


But the time it may take to engineer the cells for that next step has expanded from four to eight weeks because there are not as many researchers working on the trial as before the NIH staff cuts, Phelps said.

ìSo hereís the tricky part: Should I continue staying off chemo and hope a tumor grows to meet the 1-centimeter threshold, or give up on clinical trials for now?î Phelps said. Giving up on the trials would mean a return to traditional chemotherapy and radiation to treat her cancer.

She was told that the NIH team will work to engineer her cells at a faster rate than others in the trial so it wonít take eight weeks, but the process will still take weeks.

Overall, ìgoing from four to eight weeks is a huge deal for people with metastatic cancer,î Phelps said, adding that it could lead to further complications or even be life-threatening.


ìJust to give you a personal example, at the end of March, my scan showed I had disease that was stable, and my blood work showed that my tumor antigens were coming down. It was at a number of 43 for something called a CEA,î Phelps said. This carcinoembryonic antigen test measures levels of the CEA protein in the blood, as certain cancers like colorectal may cause high levels.

ìOne month later, my disease had spread to my bones, all of my lymph nodes, and my CEA marker was 203. Thatís in one month, in four weeks,î she said. ìFor some patients, it might not be a huge deal. For other patients, like me, it is, and it could cost them their life.î

The reductions in NIH funding and staff are happening at a time when colorectal cancer cases have been rising among younger adults. A report released in 2023 by the American Cancer Society said that the proportion of colorectal cancer cases among adults younger than 55 increased from 11% in 1995 to 20% in 2019.

ìThe rates of cancer amongst people younger than 50 are on the rise, and they tend to be aggressive and later-stage cancers,î Phelps said. ìSo it makes zero sense, if you care about keeping America healthy, to reduce your medical research at a time when you have cancer rates rising in your younger population that are the ones working and driving the economy.î


Phelps added that if she could wave a magic wand, she would wish for ìall the cancer research to be restored to where it was before this administration started.î

ëYou donít care about Natalieí
US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was asked at a Senate committee hearing Wednesday about NIH staff cuts and Phelpsí case specifically.

Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, said during the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing that Phelpsí ìbest hopeî is the NIH clinical trial.


Kennedy said that if Murray contacts his office, he can help.

ìI donít think that should happen to anybody,î Kennedy said of Phelpsí case.

ìWell, what have you ñ and I mean you personally ñ done to assess how those staff cuts are impacting patient care? She is one of many,î Murray asked.

ìI provided the guidelines that said no clinical trials should be affected by the cuts,î Kennedy responded.


ìMr. Secretary, I just have a short amount of time ñ they are impacting clinical trials,î Murray interrupted.

ìYou asked me the question. Do you want me to answer it?î Kennedy retorted.

Lawmakers press Kennedy on mass cuts ahead of future budget

Their heated exchange continued.


ìI offered to help her, but you donít care. You donít care about Natalie,î Kennedy said. ìIíve offered to help Natalie.î

Murray then pressed him about proposed cuts at the NIH.

ìI think the cuts that are now proposed by NIH are going to hurt,î Kennedy said. ìThereís no agency head in the government, like myself, that wants to see their budget cut.î

Murray asked for a personal update on Phelpsí case from Kennedyís office in the next 24 hours, as well as details about the state of NIH clinical care.


Later in the hearing, Kennedy said that his team had identified Phelpsí case and that she has not met the criteria to receive treatment in the trial.

ìIt had nothing to doî with the reduction in force at the NIH, he said. ìNone of our clinical trials were shut down because of the RIF. That was a canard.î

Murray later responded that she spoke with Phelps directly and that it was her doctor at the NIH who told Phelps that staffing cuts were having an impact.

ìThe issue, as I stated clearly, was the delay in care,î Murray said. ìMy staff has put in inquiries with HHS leadership, and theyíve been unresponsive so far. And just to make it clear, this is just one case of many.î

Federal health overhaul
HHS ìremains committedî to advancing cancer research, spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in an email.


ìHHS deeply values cancer research and remains committed to advancing life-saving scientific studies that improve patient care and outcomes to Make America Healthy Again,î he said.

When plans for the restructuring of HHS were announced in late March, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. described them as an effort to allow the department to do more at a lower cost to taxpayers.

ìThis overhaul will be a win-win for taxpayers and for those that HHS serves,î he said.

Trump administration cut $2.7 billion in NIH research funding through March, Senate committee minority report says

A new Senate HELP Committee minority staff report, released Tuesday and authored by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, found that the Trump administration cut $2.7 billion in NIH research funding in the first three months of this year ñ including a 31% reduction in cancer research funding from January through March compared with the same timeframe last year.


In a post on X in response, HHS called Sandersí report ìunequivocally falseî and ìa politically motivated distortion that undermines the thousands of dedicated public health professionals across HHS, who remain steadfast in their commitment to delivering results for the American people.î The post added that HHS is ìstreamlining programs, eliminating redundancies, and ñ above all else ñ prioritizing gold standard science.î

Itís estimated that at least 1 in 5 people with cancer in the US participate in some form of medical research.

ìClinical trials are a key part of delivery of care to patients. At a large academic center, such as all the large cancer centers, clinical trials are deeply ingrained into patient care ñ and without clinical trials, advances in delivery of care to patients will not be made. Itís only through clinical trials that high-quality data about new treatments and cures can be developed,î said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, who has been following the changes at the NIH.

ìI can also say that terminating multiyear research projects midway leads to a lot of waste of taxpayersí dollars, because there has already been substantial investment in a project,î he said. ìSo if you end a study when itís halfway done or three-quarters of the way done, then thereís no benefit to either science or to patients after there has already been substantial investment.îhe future of her

Cassie Ventura faces intense cross-examination today in Sean Diddy Combs trial. Here are the takeaways from day 2 of her testimony,"After being in the hot seat for about nine hours over two days, Cassie Ventura is done with direct questioning from prosecutors.

Next comes the cross-examination from Sean ìDiddyî Combsí defense team.

Building on her testimony a day earlier, on Wednesday the pregnant 38-year-old pop singer described in disturbing detail what happened after her 2016 assault in a Los Angeles hotel, offered visual proof of other alleged assaults, acknowledged she settled a civil lawsuit for $20 million and explained to the jury why she decided to speak out.

ìI canít carry this anymore,î she said. ìI canít carry the shame, the guilt, the way we ñ the way I was guided to treat people like they were disposable. Whatís right is right, whatís wrong is wrong. Iím here to do the right thing.î

Ventura is the prosecutionís star witness and her testimony is key to the charges against the hip-hop mogul. Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. If convicted, he could face a sentence of up to life in prison.


Prosecutors have said Combs and his inner circle used threats, violence, drugs, bribery, arson, kidnapping and lies to coerce Ventura and another woman into participating in drug-fueled sexual parties known as ìFreak Offsî and to protect the music mogulís reputation.

The defense acknowledged Combs has been violent with former girlfriends and has a ìdifferentî sex life. However, they said the women consented to these sexual arrangements and noted he was charged with racketeering and sex trafficking, not domestic violence.

Here are the key takeaways from Wednesdayís testimony.

Ventura talked to police after 2016 hotel assault
The central evidence in the case has been the surveillance video of Combs beating Ventura at a Los Angeles hotel in March 2016, and on Wednesday, Ventura provided further details on what happened in the immediate aftermath.

She left the hotel and took an Uber home while Combs sent her a series of text messages, saying ìcall me,î ìI got 6 kidsî and claiming that he was being arrested, according to text messages read aloud in court.


ìI have a black eye and a fat lip. You are sick for thinking itís okay to do what youíve done please stay far away from me,î she wrote in one message.

ìIf you donít pick up you will never hear my voice again,î he wrote.

Venturaís friend called the police, and Ventura spoke with them, but she ìwasnít readyî to name Combs, she testified.

ìJust in that moment I didnít want to hurt him that way. It was just too much going on,î she said.


Video of the assault was first published by CNN last year. The jury has watched surveillance video of the assault at least six times so far.

Ventura details her injuries, with photos and a scar
Ventura said she suffered wounds and other medical issues from the ìFreak Offsî and from Combsí assaults, and the jury saw some of them in real-time photos and an eyebrow scar.


The jury was shown two selfie photos of Ventura that she said were taken on the Uber ride home from the hotel in March 2016. She had a ìfat lipî and was wearing sunglasses ìbecause I had a black eye underneath,î she testified.

The hotel assault came just before Ventura was set to attend the movie premiere for her film ìThe Perfect Match.î Prosecutors showed the jury a photo of Ventura dressed in a gown and wearing large black sunglasses she said were to hide her black eye, and they showed a photo of Ventura and Combs at the premiere in which some of her injuries were still visible.

ìI had bruises on my body that werenít completely covered by the makeup,î Ventura testified. ìI had quite a bit of makeup on my face.î

Takeaways from Cassie Venturaís testimony in Sean ëDiddyí Combsí racketeering trial

In addition, Ventura showed the jury a scar on her eyebrow that she said came after Combs threw her down onto the corner of a bed in 2013. Ventura sent an image of the injury to Combs that day with the text, ìSo you can remember.î


The jury also saw photos of injuries Ventura sustained from an altercation in December 2011 and photos of her with a black eye mostly concealed by sunglasses in Jamaica in 2013 or 2014.

The ìFreak Offsî ñ and the drugs she took to endure them ñ caused her gastrointestinal problems, mouth sores and frequent urinary tract infections, she testified. She became ìheavily dependent on opiatesî during the relationship and eventually went to rehab, she testified.

In 2023, she was having horrible flashbacks and became suicidal, she testified. She tried to walk into traffic, but her husband stopped her, she testified as she broke down into tears.

Lawsuit was settled for $20 million
On November 16, 2023, Ventura filed a bombshell lawsuit against Combs alleging he assaulted, raped and sex trafficked her. Combs denied wrongdoing, and the two settled the lawsuit a day later, but her lawsuit set off a series of other civil suits against Combs alleging wrongdoing.


In court Wednesday, she said the settlement was for $20 million.

Earlier that year, Ventura had written a book about her experience with Combs, sent it to the rapper through a lawyer and told him that he could buy the rights to it for $30 million.

ìI wanted to be compensated for the time, the pain, the many, many years of having to fix my life,î she said.

The eight-figure dollar amount is likely to be key to the defenseís attempt to question Venturaís motives. In opening statements, defense attorney Teny Geragos noted some of the accusers ìwent to a civil lawyer for a money grabî instead of going to law enforcement.

Ventura says she sometimes fought back
While Ventura did not fight back against Combs during the 2016 hotel assault, she testified there were other times when she did so, particularly in the beginning of their relationship.


ìI learned that it could escalate the fight more and make it worse for myself,î she said.

Fighting back would ìmake him more violent, make him stronger, make him want to push me harder in that situation,î Ventura said.

She testified that there were times when she initiated physical fights with Combs, but she never saw any injuries on him afterwards.

After a party at a club in Los Angeles, Combs called her ìa slut or b*tchî when they got in the car, and she drunkenly punched him in the face, she said. Combs then beat her and stomped on her face as she lay on the floor of the vehicle, Ventura testified. She tried to run away, but Combsí security caught up with her and brought her into the house, she testified.


ì(I) just didnít look like myself at all, just knots and bleeding, swollen everything. I looked horrible,î she said.

Combs told her she had to ìsneak out of the houseî and go with security to stay at a hotel, she said. She snuck into the hotel ìcovered up, because no one could see me like that,î and stayed there for a week, she added.

Ventura testified that she didnít think it was ìsafeî for her to try to leave.

ìI understood Seanís capabilities, his access to guns, and the threats that he made prior to that,î she said.

ëFreak Offí videos were used as blackmail, Ventura says
Combs took videos of the ìFreak Offsî and used those as blackmail to threaten and coerce Ventura, according to her testimony.


In one instance, they had an argument at the Cannes Film Festival, and on the flight home he played videos of ìFreak Offsî that she thought had been deleted, she testified. Combs told her ìthat he was going to embarrass me and release them,î Ventura said, a threat he allegedly made frequently.",14-May-25,Entertainment,"Lauren del Valle, Nicki Brown, Eric Levenson, Kara

ìThe mighty E Street Band is here tonight to call upon the righteous power of art, of music, of rock ní roll in dangerous times,î Springsteen said at the beginning of a concert in Manchester, northern England, on Wednesday.

ìIn my home, the America I love ó the America Iíve written about that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years ó is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration,î he said.


ìTonight, we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American spirit to rise with us, raise your voices against authoritarianism,î added Springsteen.

The rock star spoke out several times during the show, later posting clips of his comments to his Instagram account.

ìThe last check on power, after the checks and balances of government have failed, are the people ó you and me. Itís in the union of people around a common set of values. Now thatís all that stands between democracy and authoritarianism. So at the end of the day, all weíve really got is each other,î he continued.


He later criticized some of the US administrationís most recent policies.

ìIn America, the richest men are taking satisfaction in abandoning the worldís poorest children to sickness and death. This is happening now,î he said.

ìIn my country, they are taking sadistic pleasure in the pain that they inflict on loyal American workers, theyíre rolling back historic civil rights legislation that led to a more just and plural society,î he said.

Bruce Springsteen slams Trump while urging Americans to vote for Harris

ìTheyíre abandoning our great allies and siding with dictators against those struggling for their freedom. Theyíre defunding American universities that wonít bow down to their ideological demands. Theyíre removing residents off American streets, and without due process of law, are deporting them to foreign detention centers and prisons. This is all happening now,î added Springsteen.

The singer also criticized US lawmakers for failing to protect the American people from what he called ìan unfit president and a rogue government,î and having ìno concern or idea of what it means to be deeply American.î

ìThe America that Iíve sung to you about for 50 years is real and, regardless of its faults, is a great country with a great people, so will survive this moment,î said Springsteen.

The Manchester show was the first on the European leg of Springsteen and the E Street Bandís ìLand of Hope and Dreamsî tour, which will also take in dates in France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the Czech Republic.

Springsteen previously criticized Trump and urged Americans to vote for Kamala Harris at a campaign rally for the Democratic candidate last year.

His criticism of Trump comes after Hollywood star Robert De Niro took aim at the US president at the Cannes Film Festival on Tuesday.

ìIn my country, we are fighting like hell for the democracy we once took for granted,î said De Niro.

ìThat affects all of us here, because the arts are democratic, art is inclusive and brings people together, like tonight. Art looks for truth. Art embraces diversity, and thatís why art is a threat,î added De Niro, who is an outspoken critic of the US president.

ìThatís why we are a threat to autocrats and fascists,î he added.

De Niro ended his speech with a call for people to stand up to Trump ìwithout violence, but with great passion and determination.î

"How Cassie Venturas husband, Alex Fine, and Sean Diddy Combs kids and mother are showing up for them in court","Back in August 2019, Alex Fine posted a video of his wife Cassie Ventura, holding and comforting him after he ran 50 miles to raise money for his domestic violence charity.

ìJust the person I needed with me the whole time,î Fine wrote in the caption of his post. ìWow I am so lucky to be able to hug her after this. She makes me better in every way.î

Fine is now showing his support for his wife, as Ventura, who is weeks from delivering their third child, testifies against the man she says made her life torturous, her former boyfriend and producer Sean ìDiddyî Combs.


Fine, who married Ventura the same month he posted the video, was in the courtroom Tuesday. He was seen staring at Combs before Ventura took the stand to testify about her past relationship with Combs and their ìFreak Offs,î which she said included her having sex with male escorts while Combs watched for his pleasure.

Combs has blown air kisses and gestured to his family supporters in court this week. He has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.

Combs and Ventura each appear to be leaning into the support of their respective families as the public hears graphic testimony about their time together, which included a 2016 surveillance video that shows Ventura being physically assaulted by her then-boyfriend, Combs.


ëMen who hit women arenít mení
Fine was reportedly first hired as a personal trainer for Combs before landing Ventura as his client as well.

Ventura, now 38, first met Combs, now 55, when she was a 19-year-old singer. Their longterm relationship played out, off and on, between 2007 and 2018.

She told Vogue in 2019 that she and Fine had met at a gym and didnít date long before they discovered they were pregnant with their first child.

ìWe decided to plan a wedding for this past summer after debating between getting married before or after the baby came,î she said at the time.

Fine has often shared his admiration for his wife on social media and was there for her after she filed a civil lawsuit against Combs in November 2023, which was quickly settled without Combs admitting wrongdoing.

In it, Ventura alleged that during their relationship Combs controlled all aspects of her personal life, forced her to engage in sex acts with other men and ìintroducedî her to a lifestyle of ìexcessive alcohol and substance abuse.î

When she tried to end things with Combs in 2018, she alleged that he forced his way into her home and raped her. Combs has denied her allegations.

According to her complaint at the time, Ventura still suffered from ìimmense emotional distressî and at one point she checked into an inpatient rehabilitation center after having suicidal thoughts she linked to abuse.

Her husband has a personal connection to domestic violence beyond Ventura.

In a March 2020 post on his Almost Home site, Fine wrote, ìWhen I got the news that my mom had been the victim of domestic abuse and violence, I really didnít know how to handle it.î

Fine said his ìangerî over the abuse his mother endured deeply affected him.

ìI didnít want to give in to those paralyzing feelings,î he wrote. ìSo, I decided to channel my anger and feelings of helplessness by running fifty miles to bring awareness and hopefully raise some money for other victims of domestic violence.î

That was the race of which he shared footage of Ventura with him after he finished.

After CNN first published 2016 surveillance footage of Combs assaulting Ventura at the now-closed InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles, Fine shared a letter he wrote about domestic violence on social media.

ìMen who hit women arenít men,î Fine wrote. ìMen who enable it and protect those people arenít men. As men violence against women shouldnít be inevitable, check your brothers, your friends and your family.î

He also offered support to those who have been abused, writing, ìWe want you to succeed and to flourish.î

ìTo all the women and children, Iím sorry you live in a world where youíre not protected, and you donít feel equal,î he wrote. ìI want to raise my daughters in a world where they are safe and loved.î

Fine had a warning for men who commit domestic violence.

ìTo the abusers, youíre done, youíre not safe anymore, youíre not protected anymore, the men by your side are just as weak,î Fine wrote.

He may be called as a witness in Combsí trial. There was debate raised by the defense team as to whether Fine should be allowed to be present during his wifeís testimony, which began Tuesday, but the judge allowed him to attend.

Prior to Venturaís testimony, Combsí defense team made a request to have Ventura, who is more than eight months pregnant, seated at the witness stand before the jury entered the courtroom.

ìThere is a quality to her walking in front of the jury that I think is easily avoidable,î Combsí attorney, Marc Agnifilo, requested in court on Monday.

Judge Arun Subramanian ultimately denied the request.

A representative for Combs declined to comment.

Hearts from the Combs family
Combsí mother, Janice Combs, and his six adult children have shown up to the courthouse, ìunitedî in their support for the embattled music industry vet, a source close to the Combsí family told CNN this week.

ìEveryone is upbeat. Everyone is holding faith,î the individual added.

The mogul has been vocal in the past about his love of family.

In 2022, Combs appeared on his then-girlfriend Caresha ìYung Miamiî Brownleeís series ìCaresha Pleaseî and talked about being a single dad in the wake of the 2018 death of Kim Porter, mother of three of his children.

ìFatherhood has been really, really real,î he said at the time. ìëCause I was like a part-time father, you know what Iím talking about?î

All that changed when Porter died in 2018, following a bout of pneumonia at the age of 47. Combs stepped up to be more involved in the care of their twin daughters and son.

The Combs children are:

ï Quincy Brown, 33: Brown is the son of Porter and singer Al B. Sure, but was raised by Combs. The actor who starred in the Fox musical drama ìStarî has stepped up to assist Combs raising Brownís twin sisters, who are two of Combsí four daughters.

ï Justin Dior Combs, 31: The eldest of the children, Justin was born to Combs and his former girlfriend, fashion stylist Misa Hylton. The younger Combs played football for UCLA and was often featured in dance videos with his father and younger brother, Christian.

ï Christian ìKingî Combs, 27: Diddyís look-alike son followed his father into the music industry as a rapper. He was accused of sexual assault in a lawsuit last year. His father is not accused of sexual assault in the lawsuit but is included on allegations of liability and aiding and abetting. Aaron Dyer, an attorney for the father and son, said in a statement to CNN at the time that they believe the lawsuit contains ìmanufactured lies and irrelevant facts.î Porter is Christianís mother.

ï Chance Combs, 18: The eldest daughter of Combs, she was born to the mogul and Atlanta-based businesswoman Sarah Chapman in July 2006. Chance Combs was her fatherís date for the 2022 Academy Awards and shared that she was an aspiring actress. ìZendaya is one of my biggest inspirations and someone that I really want to work with in the future,î the teen told Laverne Cox on the red carpet as her father proudly looked on.

ï DíLila and Jessie Combs, 18: The twins were born to Porter and Combs a few months after Chance was born. Porterís discovery of Chapmanís pregnancy contributed to the end of her longtime on-again, off-again relationship with Combs, she told Essence magazine shortly after they split. ìI left because at this point in my life I want something different for myself,î she said at the time. ìI invested ten years, I have children, and Iíve always stood by him. But now itís time for me and what I want to do for Kim.î

ï Love Sean Combs, 2: The youngest of Combsís brood was born to cybersecurity expert Dana Tran. Her father had earlier restyled himself as ìLoveî and since their daughterís birth, Tran has shared plenty of content featuring the little one on her Instagram account. The toddler has not been seen in court this week.

In October, the elder children released a joint statement to rally around their father. ìWe stand united, supporting you every step of the way. We hold onto the truth, knowing it will prevail, and nothing will break the strength of our family.î

His daughters briefly left the courtroom on Monday, during testimony from a man who said he was paid to have sex with Ventura as Combs watched and masturbated. They returned but left again when the graphic testimony continued. One of Combsí sonís placed his arm around his paternal grandmother during some of the testimony.

A prom is scheduled Saturday for the Los Angeles-area private school attended by his twin daughters, who were not in court on Wednesday.

On Tuesday, one of his daughters made a heart shape with her hands as she faced her father. Combs retuned the gesture before catching the eye of his mother to whom he blew a kiss. His mother then blew a kiss back to him.

Robert De Niro hits out at Trump in Cannes speech,"Hollywood actor Robert De Niro has used his award acceptance speech at the Cannes Film Festival to criticize US President Donald Trump.

De Niro, 81, was receiving the Palme díOr lifetime achievement award at the event in the south of France on Tuesday when he called Trump a ìphilistine president.î

ìIn my country, we are fighting like hell for the democracy we once took for granted,î said De Niro to an audience including some of the biggest names in showbiz.


ìThat affects all of us here, because the arts are democratic, art is inclusive and brings people together, like tonight. Art looks for truth. Art embraces diversity, and thatís why art is a threat,î added De Niro, who is an outspoken critic of the US president.

ìThatís why we are a threat to autocrats and fascists. Americaís philistine president has had himself appointed head of one of our premier cultural institutions (the Kennedy Center). He has cut funding and support to the arts, humanities and education,î he continued.

De Niro also took aim at Trumpís reported plan to impose tariffs on movies produced outside the US


ìYou canít put a price on creativity, but apparently you can put a tariff on it. Of course, this is unacceptable. All of these attacks are unacceptable,î he said.

Elizabeth Hurley says she and Billy Ray Cyrus are happy together,"Elizabeth Hurley is sounding pretty giddy about her relationship with Billy Ray Cyrus.

The model and actress recently spoke with European news outlet RTL TV at the Breast Cancer Research Foundationís 2025 Hot Pink Party about her romance with the country singer, People magazine reported.

ìI have to go back to England tomorrow, but Billy will come to England soon,î she told the outlet.

ìHappy Easter ??,î the caption on the photo read.

CNN reached out to representatives for the two for comment.


Hurley told RTL TV that she and Cyrus have much in common.

ìWe are very happy, we both love country music, we both love the country, and we both love our kids,î she said. ìWeíre happy together.î

And while their romance may be new, the pair have known each other for awhile.

They worked together in 2022 as costars in the holiday film ìChristmas in Paradise.î Hurley shared a video about the project at the time.

ìShooting the poster for Christmas in Paradise with the heavenly @mrkelseygrammer and glorious @billyraycyrus,î she wrote in the caption of that post.

When he announced their engagement in 2022, the singer and actor described Firerose as ìthe real deal.î

That news came after his former wife, Tish Cyrus, filed for divorce from him in April 2022, after 28 years of marriage. According to her filing, they had not lived together for two years.

Billy Ray Cyrus said at the time there were no hard feelings in terms of the split from the woman with whom he shares five children: sons Trace and Braison and daughters Brandi, Miley and Noah.

Hurleyís only child, her 23-year-old son model and actor Damian Hurley, reacted positively in the comments of the post of his mother with Cyrus. The younger Hurley wrote celebratory emojis, including a red heart.

French actor Grard Depardieu found guilty of sexual assault,"A court in Paris on Tuesday found French actor GÈrard Depardieu guilty of sexually assaulting two women on a film set in 2021 and handed him an 18-month suspended prison sentence, in a fall from grace for a towering figure of French cinema.

In one of the highest-profile #MeToo cases to come before judges in France, Depardieu repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and his lawyer said he would appeal the courtís decision.

Depardieu, 76, was a towering figure in French cinema, starring in more than 200 films over five decades, including ìGreen Card,î ìThe Last Metroî and ìCyrano de Bergerac.î

His trial marked a moment of reckoning for the #MeToo protest movement over sexual violence, which has failed to gain the same traction in France as in the United States, although there are signs that social attitudes are changing.

One of the two plaintiffs, Amelie K, a set decorator now aged 54, told the court the actor had groped her all over her body as he trapped her between his legs and made explicit sexual comments on set in 2021.

ìI was terrified, he was laughing,î she recounted.


Depardieu, who denied sexual assault, had argued before the court that he did not consider placing a hand on a personís buttocks sexual assault and that some women were too easily shocked.

Handing down his sentence, the presiding judge, Thierry Donard, said of Depardieu: ìHe does not seem to have grasped either the concept of consent or the deleterious and traumatic consequences of his behaviour towards the women he assaulted.î

He ordered Depardieu, who was not in court for the verdict, to be put on a list of sex offenders.

#MeToo reckoning
Depardieu has figured prominently in the debate over the #MeToo movement in France, as he faced a growing number of sexual assault allegations that put a spotlight on how women are treated in the movie industry.

Prosecutors say he should face trial in a separate rape investigation, following allegations brought by actress Charlotte Arnould, 29, who said she could not bear remaining silent any longer.

More than a dozen women have accused Depardieu of sexual violence, though not all have filed complaints.

Depardieu has consistently denied wrongdoing. ìNever, absolutely never, have I abused a woman,î he wrote in an open letter in the daily Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023.

The Depardieu trial laid bare a generational divide in France over sexism.

Earlier during the investigation, a group of 50 French stars, including Carla Bruni, wife of former President Nicolas Sarkozy, denounced what they called the ìlynchingî of Depardieu.

Brigitte Bardot, 90, told BFM TV this week that ìthose who have talent and grope a girl get thrown into the gutter.î

Womenís rights campaigners say they have seen a shift in attitudes in France - notably following the case of Gisele Pelicot whose ex-husband was convicted last year of inviting dozens of men to rape her after drugging her unconscious.

ìItís truly a victory and a step forward. Weíre making progress,î Amelie K. told reporters after the verdict.

Cassie Ventura and Alex Fines powerful love story is rooted in a shared adversity," 
Cassie Ventura has Sean ìDiddyî Combs to thank, in part, for finding the true love of her life.

Venturaís husband, Alex Fine, was Combsí personal trainer before he became Venturaís trainer, which led to them falling in love. The two wed in 2019, after her tumultuous relationship with Combs played out, off and on, between 2007 and 2018.

Based on their social media posts and interviews, the relationship Fine and Ventura share is in direct contrast to the horror she says she suffered at the hands of Combs. As she has testified about those allegations in the federal sex-trafficking trial against Combs this week, Venturaís husband has been in court supporting her, much like he vowed to do in an open letter he shared on social media in 2019.

ìI promise you that I will do every single thing in my power to support you and help you,î he wrote at the time. ìI promise that you will never be alone. I promise that you will be loved beyond expectation and we will show our children how to be in a healthy relationship.î

Loving ìPoonieî
Fine has a nickname he utilizes as his social media handle on Instagram.

ìIím Alex to everyone, but to close friends Iím ëPoonie,í a nickname Iíve had since I was young,î he told Zero magazine.


In Fine, Ventura found a man who could sympathize with the violence she has said she was subjected to by Combs. Attorneys for Combs have said the violence in his relationship with Ventura was ìmutual.î

In a March 2020 post on his Almost Home site, Fine explained why he chose to run a 50-mile marathon to raise money for his domestic violence charity, inspired by experiences his beloved mother had suffered.

ìWhen I got the news that my mom had been the victim of domestic abuse and violence, I really didnít know how to handle it,î he wrote at the time.

Fine said his ìangerî over the abuse is mother endured deeply affected him.

ìI didnít want to give in to those paralyzing feelings,î he wrote. ìSo, I decided to channel my anger and feelings of helplessness by running fifty miles to bring awareness and hopefully raise some money for other victims of domestic violence.î

That type of sensitivity was on hand when he proposed to Ventura in 2019.

ìI knew that Alex was designing a ring, but I honestly wasnít expecting a super elaborate proposal because we already had the wedding date set, but he planned such a beautiful experience for me,î she told Vogue. ìI was so surprised!î

A cowboy at heart, the trainer turned model and actor was on location with the Compton Cowboys and asked Ventura to meet him for what turned out to be a surprise proposal.

ìHe told me to come ready because we were driving straight to dinner to celebrate my birthday early that night as my family was coming into town,î she recalled. ìI was running a little late, so he called me to check in.î

Ventura said she heard a Stevie Wonder song playing and spotted ìthe guys on their horses waving at me.î

ìI looked up and saw our initials tied up above them, then Alex came around on his horse. When he got down on one knee, everything just stopped,î she told the publication. ìI felt like I lost my sense of hearing; I just saw his mouth moving, and he said ëI want to spend the rest of my life with you.íî

They then went to Playa del Rey, where Fine had arranged for two of their friends to set up dinner and a bonfire on the beach.

ìI will never forget how special Alex made me feel that night,î Ventura said.

ìBeing a dad and husband is the greatest thing Iíve ever doneî
Fine has continued to show Ventura that she is unrivaled in his affection.

They are the parents of two daughters, Frankie 5, and Sunny, 3. Ventura is due to give birth to their third child soon.

ìIím a father, husband, and actor,î he told Zero. ìFamily and work take the most importance and focus in my life. I became the man I am today a lot from the environment I grew up in. My mom and dad are the best.î

ìBeing a dad and husband is the greatest thing Iíve ever done and I donít know how I got to be so blessed,î Fine said.

Ventura has returned the praise.

In honor of Fatherís Day last year, she shared a series of photos and video of Fine.

ìThere is just no one like you,î Ventura wrote in the caption.

Fine paid a public tribute to his wife on their third wedding anniversary.

ìIím so lucky that I got to marry my best friend and most beautiful wife in the world. Every morning I wake up and see you and the babies I get so happy,î he wrote in the caption of a series of wedding photos.

On Wednesday, Fine appeared stoic as he left the Manhattan courthouse of the Combs trial, where his wife has spent more than eight hours testifying so far about her troubled past relationship with the embattled music industry vet.

ìSheís holding up strong,î Douglas Wigdor, Venturaís attorney, told reporters outside court.

When asked how Venturaís husband was doing, he said, ìput yourself in his shoes.î

Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. His defense team has said they may call Fine to the stand to testify.

Kardashian tells court she absolutely thought robbers would kill her in $10 million heist," 
Kim Kardashian, testifying in the trial of the burglars accused of tying her up and robbing her at gunpoint nearly nine years ago, told a Paris court on Tuesday that she ìabsolutely thoughtî her assailants would kill her.

ìI have babies, I have to make it home, I have babies,î Kardashian recalled pleading with the armed men, who had broken into her hotel room while she slept during Paris Fashion Week in 2016.

Facing her alleged attackers for the first time since the heist, the billionaire reality TV star detailed how she was robbed of nearly $10 million in cash and jewelry, including a $4 million engagement ring ñ gifted to her by her then-husband Kanye West ñ that was never recovered.

Kardashian was mostly calm during her testimony, which lasted more than two hours, but was on occasions reduced to tears as she described how the burglary had upended her life and changed how she organizes her security.

The defendants ñ nine men and one woman whose ages range from 35 to 78 ñ are facing charges including armed robbery, kidnapping and conspiracy. Eight of them deny involvement, while two have pleaded guilty to some of the charges.

Kardashian arrived at court in the French capital with her mother, Kris Jenner, wearing a diamond-encrusted necklace ñ in a seeming nod to the jewels taken from her on the night of the burglary.

On the night in October 2016, Kardashian recalled being woken up by the assailants and at first not knowing what the men were demanding.

ìThere was a lot of terrorist attacks happening in the worldî around the time, Kardashian said. ìI thought thatís what it was.î One of the reasons the trial has taken so long to start is because of a backlog of major cases in France, including those related to the 2015 Paris terror attacks.

After the men had rifled through her jewelry box and snatched the engagement ring by the side of her bed, Kardashian said one of the robbers pressed a gun to her back and bound her hands together with a zip tie. She recalled being ìhysterical,î begging the robbers to let her live.

Having been woken up while wearing just a bathrobe, Kardashian said she feared the men would rape her. ìI was naked under the robe. Everything was exposed and I was sure he was going to rape me. I said a prayer and got ready for it to happenÖ but he closed my legs and taped them,î she said.

Kardashian then said she feared she would be killed ñ and that her sister, Kourtney, and friend, Simone Harouche, who was sleeping in an adjoining room downstairs, would have to find her body.

ìI knewÖ theyíd see thatÖ that Iíd be on the bed, shot dead on the bed and they would see that and have that in their brain forever,î Kardashian said.

Harouche, who has known Kardashian since they were 12 years old and is a key witness in the trial, testified earlier Tuesday. She said she had been hired as Kardashianís stylist in Paris for the fashion week, and was woken by the sound of the heist.

Fearing the burglars would next try to enter her room, Harouche locked herself in the bathroom and texted Kourtney and Kardashianís bodyguard, Pascal Duvier.

Duvier testified last week that he found Kardashian ìcrying hystericallyî when he arrived at the hotel.

Once the burglars had left, Harouche described how Kardashian, having clearly ìsuffered major trauma,î was frenetic and terrified that the men could soon return.

ìI heard her hopping down the stairs. She came into my room and she had tape around her feet,î Harouche said. ìShe was just screaming and kept saying: ëWe need to get out of here. What do we do if they come back? We might need to jump out the window.íî

The night ìchanged her life forever,î Harouche said. ììIíve seen her in grief, through a divorce, the worst of times. Iíve never seen her like this.î

After the experience, Harouche said she no longer wanted to expose herself to the risk of working with celebrities. ìI changed professions and now I do interior design,î she added.

Kardashian testified for more than two hours Tuesday, before being questioned by lawyers for the defendants.

Dubbed the ìGrandpa Robbers,î of the original 12 suspects, one has since died, and another defendant who has Alzheimerís disease has been ruled unfit to stand trial. If convicted, some of the remaining defendants could face up to 30 years in prison.

Several are repeat offenders, and much of the start of the trial ñ which opened on April 28 ñ has focused on their previous criminal acts.

Toward the end of Kardashianís testimony, the presiding judge read her a letter from Aomar AÔt Khedache, the alleged ringleader of the group, apologizing for the trauma he had inflicted. Although he was in the courtroom, the 68-year-old Khedache is partially deaf and unable to speak, his lawyer told CNN before Tuesdayís hearing.

ìI want to come to you as a human being and say how much I regret my act,î he wrote.

Visibly moved, Kardashian said she ìforgivesî him, ìbut it doesnít change the emotion and the feelings and the trauma.î

Morgan Wallen says he was just ready to go home while addressing abrupt exit on SNL,"
Morgan Wallen has no bad blood with ìSaturday Night Liveî after his abrupt exit at the end of a March episode sparked speculation online.

The ìLast Nightî singer addressed the moment while appearing on an episode of ìSundae Conversation with Caleb Pressleyî on Sunday, giving a simple explanation as to why it appeared he was so quick to leave the show.

ìI was ready to go home,î Wallen added. ìI had been there all week.î


Wallen was the musical guest on the March 29 episode of ìSNLî and confused some viewers at the time when he suddenly left the stage during the showís credits, where the cast and guests traditionally linger and hug each other. After giving the episodeís host Mikey Madison a brief hug, Wallen walked off the stage toward the side of the camera without acknowledging any of the showís cast members.

That same night, shortly after his departure, Wallen posted a photo of a plane on a runway with text across it that read, ìGet me to Godís countryî on his Instagram Story.

The post caused speculation about his experience, which spawned an internet reaction as well as an amusing mention in the following weekís ìWeekend Updateî segment of the show.


A source familiar with the situation previously told CNN that the country singer used the same path to enter and exit the studio as he had all week during rehearsals, and simply walked that same way after hugging Madison.

After the episode, longtime ìSNLî cast member Kenan Thompson told Entertainment Weekly in an interview that Wallenís exit was not ìthe norm.î

ìIt just felt so abrupt,î Thompson said. ìAnd it was already such a small grouping on the stage anyway. So it was just like, oh wow, that was pretty visible.î",12-May-25,Entertainment,Alli Rosenbloom,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/12/entertainment/morgan-wallen-addresses-snl-exit,,,,,,,,,,,,morgan wallen bad blood ‚Äúsaturday night live‚Äù abrupt exit end march episode sparked speculation online ‚Äúlast night‚Äù singer addressed moment appearing episode ‚Äúsundae conversation caleb pressley‚Äù sunday giving simple explanation appeared quick leave show ‚Äúi ready go home‚Äù wallen added ‚Äúi week‚Äù wallen musical guest march episode ‚Äúsnl‚Äù confused viewers time suddenly left stage show‚Äôs credits cast guests traditionally linger hug giving episode‚Äôs host mikey madison brief hug wallen walked stage toward side camera without acknowledging show‚Äôs cast members night shortly departure wallen posted photo plane runway text across read ‚Äúget god‚Äôs country‚Äù instagram story post caused speculation experience spawned internet reaction well amusing mention following week‚Äôs ‚Äúweekend update‚Äù segment show source familiar situation previously told cnn country singer used path enter exit studio week rehearsals simply walked way hugging madison episode longtime ‚Äúsnl‚Äù cast member kenan thompson told entertainment weekly interview wallen‚Äôs exit ‚Äúthe norm‚Äù ‚Äúit just felt abrupt‚Äù thompson said ‚Äúand already small grouping stage anyway just like oh wow pretty visible‚Äù

Rihanna new music alert: Singer to release first new song in three years for the Smurfs movie,"
Rihanna may not have her ninth studio album ready to release quite yet, but she does have a new song coming out soon to tide everyone over.

The track, titled ìFriend of Mine,î was featured on Wednesday for the first time in the new trailer for the ìSmurfsî movie, in which Rihanna voices the role of Smurfette.

In the trailer, Rihanna is seen in the studio during the recording of the song, laughing and smiling while adjusting her headphones.


The full track will be released on Friday.

ìFriend of Mineî is the first new song Rihanna has released since 2022, when she released ìLift Me Up,î the Oscar-nominated song featured in ìBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever.î

The ìSmurfsî movie follows Smurfette, who ìleads the Smurfs on a mission into the real world to saveî Papa Smurf (John Goodman) after he was ìmysteriously taken by evil wizards,î according to an official synopsis.


In addition to Rihanna and Goodman, the ìSmurfsî movie will feature a voice cast including James Corden, Nick Offerman, Dan Levy, Natasha Lyonne, Sandra Oh, Octavia Spencer, Hanna Waddingham and Kurt Russell, among others.

Supporters of the ìUmbrellaî singer have long waited for Rihanna ñ who is expecting her third child with partner A$AP Rocky ñ to release her hotly anticipated ninth studio album, which would mark her first full album since 2016ís ìAnti.î

In February, Rihanna said sheís closer than ever to completing the task in an interview with Harperís Bazaar, claiming at the time that she ìjust cracked the code on what I really want to do for my next body of work. I am actually feeling really good about this.î

Rihanna stopped short of providing a timeframe for when the album may actually come out, but did say her new music ìfeels right.î

ìIt feels like it digs right into where I need to be, and I want this,î she said. ìThis body needs to come out, and Iím ready to go there.î

The ìSmurfsî movie will be released in theaters on July 18.

"Yes, that was Ryan Reynolds dancing in the Deadpool suit at the Academy Awards","
Conan OíBrien is making a Ryan Reynolds-related revelation as he begins releasing full episodes of his podcast.

On a newly released episode of ìConan OíBrien Needs A Friendî dropping Monday night, guest Reynolds talked about that one Mickey Mouse-related line that he says Disney made him cut from last yearís hit Marvel film ìDeadpool & Wolverine,î and then revealed that he was the one in the Deadpool costume dancing behind OíBrien when he hosted the Oscars this past March.

ìYes you were, yes you were,î OíBrien confirmed.


The moment they were referencing was a song-and-dance bit in which OíBrien was joined by several others on stage at the Academy Awards.

ìI love that nobody knows that when I hosted the Oscars, that really was you as Deadpool,î OíBrien said. ìNo one knows.î

Reynolds had a bit of fun with that as well.


ìWell, yeah, most would assume arthritis at this stage,î he joked. ìNope, they have pills for that too.î

The star talked to OíBrien about several topics on the podcast, including how Hollywood has changed over the years.

ìI have a question, which is did you have an idea of what you wanted your trajectory to be?,î OíBrien asked him, regarding his career. ìWould you have been happy if TV had hit and that had worked out? Or did you always know pretty much where you wanted to end up?î

ìWell, itís so different now,î Reynolds said. ìItís like now people who are in film are hoping to gain enough respect to get a TV show.î

ìRight. If I could get ëWhite Lotus,íî OíBrien said.

"Halle Bailey gets restraining order against rapper DDG alleging violence, fear for their baby","A Los Angeles judge has granted a restraining order to ìThe Little Mermaidî actor and singer Halle Bailey, who says her ex-boyfriend, the rapper and YouTuber DDG, has been repeatedly violent with her and she fears for herself and the baby they have together.

The judge on Tuesday ordered DDG, whose legal name is Darryl Dwayne Granberry Jr., to stay away from Bailey and their 17-month-old son, Halo, until a June 6 hearing, the Associated Press reported.

ìThroughout our relationship,î Bailey said in documents requesting the order, ìDaryl has been and continues to be physically, verbally, emotionally, and financially abusive towards me. I am seeking orders to protect myself and our son Halo from his ongoing abuse.î


A message seeking comment from a representative for Granberry was not immediately answered.

Bailey, 25, and Granberry, 27, were in a relationship from 2022 until last year, and since their breakup there have been ìmultiple acts of physical violence,î Bailey said.

In a January incident that she recounts in detail, Bailey said Granberry was repeatedly calling her a ìbitchî as she tried to strap the baby into a seat inside his car.

ìThe next thing I knew, things got physical between us,î Bailey said in the documents. ìWe fought each other, wrestling and tussling. At one point, Darryl was pulling my hair. He then slammed my face on the steering wheel, causing my tooth to get chipped. I then stopped fighting back as I was in a lot of pain.î

Bailey included photos of her tooth and bruises on her arms in her filing.

In March, she said Granberry entered her house when she wasnít home and texted her a photo of her bed along with a threatening message suggesting she was having sex with other men.

A few days later, she said, he berated her when she did not want to send their sick baby on a visit with him, and smashed the Ring camera on her porch when he realized it was recording the confrontation. She said when she called a relative for help, he took her phone and got into his car, slamming the door on her as she was holding the baby. Bailey filed a police report over the incident.

She also asked that Granberry be ordered to stop using his streaming platforms on Twitch and YouTube to turn his followers against her.

ìWhenever he wishes to cause upset, he starts bad mouthing me to his several millions of fans,î she said in the documents. ìHe claims I am withholding our son and that I am with other men. As a result, I then receive threats and hate on social media.î

Granberry was also ordered not to possess any weapons. The judge can extend the order for up to five years at the June 6 hearing.

DDG, from Pontiac, Michigan, first saw success as a video streamer and then as a hip-hop artist. On May 5, he released his fourth studio album, ìBlame the Chat,î on Epic records.

Bailey, from Atlanta, has been nominated for six Grammy Awards as both a solo artist and as part of Chloe x Halle, the duo with her sister that first brought her fame.

Simu Liu announces engagement to girlfriend Allison Hsu,"ìBarbieî actor and Marvel star Simu Liu has announced his engagement to girlfriend Allison Hsu.

The Chinese-Canadian actor, who was Marvelís first Asian superhero and played a Ken doll in the 2023 hit ìBarbieî movie, shared a series of romantic snaps on Instagram Sunday.

ìUs forever,î Hsu wrote in a joint post, followed by a string of diamond ring and white heart emojis.


Often dubbed the ìcity of love,î the pair shared several photos taken in Paris against the backdrop of the cityís skyline, with Hsu sporting an impressive diamond ring.

Hsu replied, declaring: ìI love you fiancÈ!!!!!!!!!!î

The pair were first thought to be officially dating in late 2022 when they attended the premiere of action-comedy ìViolent Nightî together in Los Angeles, California.

Around the same time, Hsu posted a picture on Instagram of the pair cuddling.

Speaking in December 2022 about what he admired about his partner, Liu told People that Hsu was ìa badass, sheís a fighter and sheís very, very passionate about all things in life, her work, her job, and her other things.î

ìAnd thatís a language that I speak very well, and I am happy to see where it goes,î he said at the time.

Liu rose to international fame after his starring role in 2021 Marvel movie ìShang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings.î

More recently, the actor appeared as a guest star and investor on an episode of CBCís ìDragonsí Den.î During his time on the show, he raised questions about cultural appropriation after the owners of a Canadian bubble tea company appeared on the ìShark-Tankî-style series, seeking an investment.

Cecily Strong and Colin Jost make surprise cameos in SNL cold open,"
Things started off warmly enough on this weekendís episode of ìSaturday Night Liveî but then took a turn.

Cast members Kenan Thompson, Marcello Hernandez and Bowen Yang appeared in the cold open for a heartfelt tribute to their moms ahead of Motherís Day, but the moment was cut short when James Austin Johnson as Donald Trump showed up and sent them all packing.

He began his bit by talking about the newly elected Pope Leo XIV and joking about the 69-year-oldís hometown saying, ìWe have an American pope ñ Chicago-style. No ketchup.î

ìWe like Pope Leo. We hope he doesÖ what we want,î Johnson as Trump continued, adding, ìotherwise Iíll have to send JD back to do his thing.î The joke was a reference to the vice presidentís visit to the Vatican shortly before the death of Pope Francis last month.

He continued to discuss the pope and the Catholic Church, saying, ìWe love Catholic ñ itís one of the stronger Christian organizations, along with Salvation Army and, I wanna say, Chick-fil-A.î

Soon, he was joined on stage by ìSNLî alum Cecily Strong as Jeanine Pirro, who was appointed interim US attorney for Washington, DC this week. Strong frequently portrayed Pirro during her time on the show.

Strong as Pirro came out with a large black bag, which she joked was ìa cozy for my Merlot-zy,î removing a bottle of red wine from the bag for good measure.

Johnson as Trump said what he liked about Pirro, observing that ìsheís a great legal mind, and she has the most important quality I look for in a lawyer: sheís on TV.î

ìYouíre very very tough,î he later added.

ìÖEspecially on immigration,î Strong as Pirro replied. ìI donít have any reservations about sending things back. My friends know I have sent back every salad Iíve ever ordered at a restaurant.î

ìWouldnít know. Iíve never eaten one,î Johnson as Trump said.

The sketch ended with an appearance by current ìSNLî cast member and ìWeekend Updateî anchor Colin Jost, who portrayed Pete Hegseth.

The episode was hosted by ìWhite Lotusî star Walton Goggins, with musical guest Arcade Fire.

Tom Cruise gives Cannes another thrill with latest Mission: Impossible,"Tom Cruise was last at Cannes in 2022, when the film festival gave him an honorary Palme díOr and, in return, got one of the last bona fide Hollywood stars to grace their red carpet as he launched ìTop Gun: Maverick.î

Fighter jets swooped overhead, and Cruise, who hadnít been to the festival in 30 years at that point, flashed that megawatt smile. Before you knew it, ìMaverickî soared past one billion dollars at the box office.

Which needed the other more ñ the festival or the star? It doesnít matter, the formula worked so well they commissioned a sequel to the whole spectacle.

On Wednesday night, Cruise ascended the steps of the Palais de Festivals once more for the gala premiere of ìMission: Impossible ñ The Final Reckoning.î As the cast assembled on the red carpet, an orchestra struck up a live rendition of Lalo Schifrinís theme tune, Cruise flashed that smile andÖ well, as Jerry Maguire once said, ìShow me the money.î

The film, which leans heavy on the franchiseís three-decade legacy, played well with the audience. Inside the Grand Theatre Lumiere, there was sporadic applause throughout for Cruiseís spy Ethan Hunt, series regulars Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames and newer recruits including Hayley Atwell.

Prolonged applause during the credits gave way to some words by director Christopher McQuarrie, who recalled being ìone of those kids who didnít quite fit inî when he was growing up.

ìA lot of my life was imaginative play. I got to grow up and have my very own action figure, who was actually willing to do just about any crazy thing I could think of,î he said, gesturing to Cruise.

ìIím grateful for your support, your friendship, your insanely unquestioning devotion to this craft, and most of all for your artistry,î McQuarrie, a four-time director in the ìMissionî franchise, added.

Cruise for his part noted McQuarrieís expansion of the franchiseís ambitions while looking forward to making ìa bunch of other kinds of moviesî with the director.

The comment further muddies the picture of whether this is the final ìMission: Impossibleî film. It was unclear from the filmís marketing if that were the case, and it remains unanswered even after watching all 165 minutes of the movie.

Shot in the UK, South Africa and Svalbard in the Arctic, ìFinal Reckoningî picks up where 2023ís ìDead Reckoningî left off, with Cruiseís Hunt pursuing the destruction of pervasive AI enemy The Entity. The stakes, already high, are ratcheted up significantly; arguably, Hunt and co. have never faced a graver scenario.

An exposition-heavy opening third, prone to repetition, offers a wobbly scaffolding on which Cruise and McQuarrie hang some truly spectacular set pieces. If the film spent less time worrying about explaining itself ñ or drifting into a reflective, sometimes somber mood ñ it might be more straightforward and more fun.

That said, when Cruise is firing all cylinders, in the well-advertised acrobatic biplane scene, and a nightmare-fuel deep sea diving sequence, heís a marvel to behold.

The actor has long been in a category of one when it comes to his on-screen pursuits, and this is no different. Itís no easy task for a director to keep up with Cruise, but McQuarrie does admirable and inventive work, and wisely lets the action do the talking when the film is at its best.

Despite the positive notices at Cannes, ìFinal Reckoningî will face stiffer headwinds than Cruise hanging off the side of an airplane to reach profitability. The film reportedly cost around $400 million, and studio Paramount will no doubt be nervous given ìDead Reckoningî relatively underperformed. The 2023 film, originally billed as ìDead Reckoning ñ Part One,î grossed $571 million worldwide ñ down from the franchiseís peak of $792 million for ìFalloutî in 2018 ñ although it was faced with the box office tidal wave of ìBarbenheimerî shortly after its release, something the latest movie has steered clear of.

Will ìFinal Reckoningî be a critical and commercial slam dunk like ìMaverickî? Paramount will care more than Cannes and more than McQuarrie. The festival got its star, and the director got to play with his action figure once more.

ìMission: Impossible ñ The Final Reckoningî premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 14 ahead of its release in cinemas from May 23.

Cassie Ventura is not letting victim shaming stop her from sharing her difficult story,"There were moments when Cassie Ventura did not seem comfortable in the spotlight, perhaps because of what she now says was happening in the shadows.

The star witness against Sean ìDiddyî Combs in his sex-trafficking trial, Ventura will give voice to the disturbing abuse allegations against Combs, her ex-boyfriend and former producer.

Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.

The woman who was often the quiet beauty on Combsí arm at events for more than a decade has opened herself up to the judgment that comes for almost all women who accuse men, especially celebrities, of wrongdoing.

Nsenga K. Burton, a film producer, journalist and founder of ìThe Burton Wire,î told CNN the shame that surrounds accounts like Venturaís - in which there are allegations of both domestic violence and sexual assault - is not unexpected.

ìWhen we think about shame, shame is a tool, a weapon used against women who are involved in relationships with complicated men,î Burton said.


ëSouvenirs of the most humiliating nights of her lifeí
Ventura is at the heart of the criminal case against Combs.

In the governmentís opening statement, Assistant US Attorney Emily Johnson described the alleged abuse and coerced-participation Ventura experienced in choreographed - at times videotaped - sexual encounters with male escorts that Combs called ìFreak Offs.î

ìThe defendant told Cassie that if she defied him again, he would publicly release the videos of her having sex with male escorts that he kept as blackmail,î Johnson said.
ìSouvenirs of the most humiliating nights of her life.î

ìHe beat her when she didnít answer the phone when he called. He beat her when she left a freak-off without his permission,î Johnson continued. ìHe beat her when he thought she took too long in the bathroom. The defendant taught Cassie that defying him could and often would end in violence. And when she tried to run away, he always found her.î

In her 2023 civil lawsuit against Combs, which was quickly settled without Combs admitting wrongdoing, Ventura painted a dark picture of a relationship that appeared golden in public.

Ventura, now 38, first met Combs, now 55, when she was a 19-year-old singer. Their longterm relationship played out, off and on, between 2007 and 2018.

Behind closed doors, she alleged, Combs controlled all aspects of her personal life, forced her to engage in sex acts with other men and ìintroducedî her to a lifestyle of ìexcessive alcohol and substance abuse.î

When Ventura tried to end her relationship with Combs in 2018, she alleged that he forced his way into her home and raped her. Combs has denied her allegations.

Ventura, according to her complaint, still suffers from ìimmense emotional distressî and at one point she checked into an inpatient rehabilitation center after having suicidal thoughts she linked to abuse.

Witness testimony continues in Sean ëDiddyí Combsí trial

Collette Gee is a domestic and sexual assault survivor who uses her experience as a psychiatric nurse and certified violence prevention specialist in her work as an author and relationship coach.

She said Ventura finds herself in a situation familiar to many others who have accused someone they were in a relationship with of wrongdoing: public scrutiny.

ìThe first thing that we need to do is stop asking survivors why did you stay and start asking what made it impossible for her to safely leave that relationship,î Gee told CNN. ìAnd that shift is, in my opinion, long overdue especially when the [alleged] abuser holds wealth and power and influence like Diddy does.î

The attempts to discredit women like Ventura discount the reality of their lives, Gee said. Combsí defense team on Monday described his relationship with Ventura as ìmutuallyî violent and said all their sexual encounters were consensual.

ìIn an abusive relationship itís critical that we understand that a victim defending themselves is not the same as two people being mutually violent,î Gee said. ìSometimes a victim may strike out in fear and desperation, but that doesnít make the abuse equal.î

Women as property
Burton pointed to a power imbalance with Combs and Ventura.

ìWhenever you have these high-profile cases, especially involving celebrities who are not equally yoked, where one is definitely more powerful, like oneís a mogul and the other isÖ thereís always shame brought on the other person,î Burton said.

ìItís this idea that, ëWell, you benefited from your association with this person, right?í Who is Cassie without Diddy. This is what people think,î Burton said. ìBut that also just plays into sexism. The idea that women who are attached to super rich, wealthy men are really just objects to be paid for.î

ìItís really because of the historic, power dynamics between men and women, and this idea that women truly are the property of men,î she added.

During a 2018 appearance on the ìEbro in the Morningî show, Ventura, wearing sunglasses indoors and speaking with raspy voice, said she was there to support a short film she had made about her music, specifically the song, ìLove A Loser.î",13-May-25,Entertainment,Lisa Respers France,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/13/entertainment/cassie-ventura-diddy-trial,,,,,,,,,,,,moments cassie ventura seem comfortable spotlight perhaps now says happening shadows star witness sean ‚Äúdiddy‚Äù combs sextrafficking trial ventura give voice disturbing abuse allegations combs exboyfriend former producer combs pleaded guilty charges include racketeering conspiracy sex trafficking transportation engage prostitution woman often quiet beauty combs‚Äô arm events decade opened judgment comes almost women accuse men especially celebrities wrongdoing nsenga k burton film producer journalist founder ‚Äúthe burton wire‚Äù told cnn shame surrounds accounts like ventura‚Äôs allegations domestic violence sexual assault unexpected ‚Äúwhen think shame shame tool weapon used women involved relationships complicated men‚Äù burton said ‚Äòsouvenirs humiliating nights life‚Äô ventura heart criminal case combs government‚Äôs opening statement assistant us attorney emily johnson described alleged abuse coercedparticipation ventura experienced choreographed times videotaped sexual encounters male escorts combs called ‚Äúfreak offs‚Äù ‚Äúthe defendant told cassie defied publicly release videos sex male escorts kept blackmail‚Äù johnson said ‚Äúsouvenirs humiliating nights life‚Äù ‚Äúhe beat didn‚Äôt answer phone called beat left freakoff without permission‚Äù johnson continued ‚Äúhe beat thought took long bathroom defendant taught cassie defying often end violence tried run away always found her‚Äù civil lawsuit combs quickly settled without combs admitting wrongdoing ventura painted dark picture relationship appeared golden public cassie ventura sean diddy combs cassie ventura sean diddy combs neilson barnardgetty images ventura now first met combs now yearold singer longterm relationship played behind closed doors alleged combs controlled aspects personal life forced engage sex acts men ‚Äúintroduced‚Äù lifestyle ‚Äúexcessive alcohol substance abuse‚Äù ventura tried end relationship combs alleged forced way home raped combs denied allegations ventura according complaint still suffers ‚Äúimmense emotional distress‚Äù one point checked inpatient rehabilitation center suicidal thoughts linked abuse sean combs vanity fair oscar party arrivals los angeles usa mar related livestory witness testimony continues sean ‚Äòdiddy‚Äô combs‚Äô trial collette gee domestic sexual assault survivor uses experience psychiatric nurse certified violence prevention specialist work author relationship coach said ventura finds situation familiar many others accused someone relationship wrongdoing public scrutiny ‚Äúthe first thing need stop asking survivors stay start asking made impossible safely leave relationship‚Äù gee told cnn ‚Äúand shift opinion long overdue especially alleged abuser holds wealth power influence like diddy does‚Äù attempts discredit women like ventura discount reality lives gee said combs‚Äô defense team monday described relationship ventura ‚Äúmutually‚Äù violent said sexual encounters consensual ‚Äúin abusive relationship it‚Äôs critical understand victim defending two people mutually violent‚Äù gee said ‚Äúsometimes victim may strike fear desperation doesn‚Äôt make abuse equal‚Äù women property burton pointed power imbalance combs ventura ‚Äúwhenever highprofile cases especially involving celebrities equally yoked one definitely powerful like one‚Äôs mogul is‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs always shame brought person‚Äù burton said ‚Äúit‚Äôs idea ‚Äòwell benefited association person right‚Äô cassie without diddy people think‚Äù burton said ‚Äúbut also just plays sexism idea women attached super rich wealthy men really just objects paid for‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs really historic power dynamics men women idea women truly property men‚Äù added appearance ‚Äúebro morning‚Äù show ventura wearing sunglasses indoors speaking raspy voice said support short film made music specifically song ‚Äúlove loser‚Äù

ìWickedî the film was so popular that a special is coming to the small screen.

The movieís director Jon M. Chu reportedly made the announcement Monday during NBCUniversalís upfront presentation, held at Radio City Music Hall in New York City.

Calling the special ìsomething thatís never been done in the 22-year history of ëWicked,íî Chu said, according to Variety, that it would feature stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande performing live songs from the first movie ìand maybe a little bit from the second one as well.î

"Dwayne Johnson, is that you? See his dramatic new look as UFC fighter Mark Kerr in The Smashing Machine trailer","
Dwayne Johnson is soon heading to theaters in what might be the most dramatic role of his career so far.

In ìThe Smashing Machine,î Johnson will play MMA and UFC fighter Mark Kerr, who was the subject of a 2002 HBO documentary that chronicled his substance abuse and explored the brutality of the sport to which heíd dedicated his life.

The new trailer for ìThe Smashing Machine,î released Tuesday by A24, hits on those themes and more, also highlighting Kerrís tumultuous relationship with his girlfriend, played in the film by Johnsonís former ìJungle Cruiseî co-star Emily Blunt.


ìWinning is the best feeling in the word,î Johnson as Kerr says in the trailer. ìItís 40,000 people in there cheering you on. Thereís no other high like it in the world.î

Though he has yet to speak specifically about his physical transformation for the role, Johnson appears to have used facial prosthetics to help him more closely resemble Kerr, whose 12-year career took off in the late í90s.

The new film marks a more dramatic turn from Johnson, who is best known for his high-octane action fare like ìSan Andreas,î ìSkyscraper,î and is certainly not what audiences might be accustomed to seeing from him.

That, he told GQ last year, was apparently the point of playing Kerr.

ìIt was also an opportunity for me, I realized, to stretch myself in ways that I hadnít been stretched yet,î he told the publication. ìAnd also challenge myself in ways that I hadnít been challenged.î

Johnsonís most recent theatrical release was last yearís ìMoana 2,î in which he once against lent his voice as Maui.

He has also been more active in the wrestling ring in recent years after making a surprise return to WWE in 2023.

The Golden Globes will add a new category recognizing podcasts starting next year,"The Golden Globes are adding a new category to recognize something other than achievements film and television.

On Wednesday, the Globes announced that a best podcast of the year category will be added to its awards slate, to debut starting next year when the ceremony will be broadcast on January 11, 2026, according to a news release.

The category will honor the ìextraordinary and diverse talents in podcasting,î the release read, while acknowledging that the annual awards ceremony is committed to giving a platform to ìthe full spectrum of entertainment, while reflecting todayís audiences and consumption behavior around the world.î


ìAs the world of entertainment continues to evolve, we are excited to recognize new forms of storytelling,î Golden Globes president Helen Hoehne said in a statement on Wednesday.

Hoehne added that ìby celebrating achievements in both audio and visual podcasts, we aim to honor our heritage categories while making room for new voices and formats to be heard.î

According to the release, only the ìtop 25 podcastsî will qualify for the award and the category will include a total of six nominees.


A representative for the Golden Globes confirmed to CNN on Wednesday that narrative, video, interview and news-based podcasts will be eligible.

The Golden Globes will announce more eligibility criteria in the coming weeks.

Comedian Nikki Glaser is set to emcee the glitzy awards ceremony in 2026, marking her second time serving as the showís host after her debut earlier this year.

In March, Glaser said that hosting ìwas without a doubt the most fun I have ever had in my career. I canít wait to do it again, and this time in front of the team from ëThe White Lotusí who will finally recognize my talent and cast me in season four as a Scandinavian Pilates instructor with a shadowy past.î

"Jeff Bridges says hes feeling good nearly 5 years after cancer diagnosis, but dealing with long-term Covid effects"," 
Jeff Bridges is sharing some good news pertaining to his health.

The ìBig Lebowskiî star, 75, told People in an interview published Friday that his health is ìvery goodî and heís ìfeeling goodî almost five years after he was diagnosed with lymphoma.

ìSome things, itís hard to tell if itís the cancer and the Covid or if itís just old age,î he said, adding that he has encountered some memory issues and that he believes heís dealing with some ìlong-termî effects from Covid-19.


ìI canít smell,î Bridges said.

In October 2020, the actor shared his cancer diagnosis via X.

ìAlthough it is a serious disease, I feel fortunate that I have a great team of doctors and the prognosis is good,î Bridges wrote at the time. ìIím starting treatment and will keep you posted on my recovery.î

The following year, he shared an update on his personal website, saying his cancerous mass had shrunk to the ìsize of a marble.î

He also said he was recovering from a severe bout of Covid-19 at the time, believing he caught the virus after being exposed at the facility where he was receiving chemotherapy treatment.

While he assured his coronavirus symptoms were ìin the rear view mirror,î he wrote that ìmy dance with Covid makes my cancer look like a piece of cake.î

ìCovid kicked my ass pretty good, but Iím double vaccinated and feeling much better now,î Bridges wrote. ìWhile I had moments of tremendous pain Ö getting close to the pearly gates, all in all, I felt happy and joyous most of the time. This brush with mortality has brought me a real gift ó life is brief and beautiful.î

The Oscar-winner recently wrapped his FX series ìThe Old Manî and is gearing up to appear in the third installment of the ìTronî franchise, out later this year.

"Adam Scott shares nostalgic photo with Ike Barinholtz, aka Sal Saperstein, in hilarious nod to The Studio","Thank you, Sal Saperstein!

Adam Scott is getting in on the gag presented in Apple TV+ís comedy series ìThe Studio.î Scott appeared as himself in a recent episode and during an award speech, he thanked his old friend Sal, VP of fictional Continental Studios. It started a hilarious trend of gratitude towards the character, played by Ike Barinholtz.

Scott shared a real throwback photo of the pair of actors from back in the day to Instagram, with the caption ìMe & Sal. Circa 2001î on Friday.


In his cameo in the acclaimed comedy, Scott accepted a Golden Globe for a fictional project and thanked Sal, who he credited with helping him in the early days of his career by giving him a couch to sleep on.

The moment sends Salís friend and boss Matt Remick ñ played by ìStudioî co-creator Seth Rogen ñ into a tailspin of jealousy, since he too wants to be thanked in a Golden Globe acceptance speech.

Barinholtz also posted the photo to Instagram, with Rogen commenting, ìDamn I can smell the couch from here.î


Many others also got in on the fun, with stars from Alison Brie to Chris Daughtry commenting with variations of, ìThank you Sal Saperstein!î

ìThe Studioî is currently streaming on Apple TV+. The show has recently been renewed for a second season.

Blue Ivy Carter is riding high on her mom Beyoncs Cowboy Carter Tour,"Welcome to the ìIvy League.î

Thatís what the fans of Blue Ivy Carter have taken to calling themselves.

The 13-year-old daughter of BeyoncÈ Knowles Carter and her husband, rapper/entrepreneur Shawn ìJay-Zî Carter is performing as a dancer with her motherís ìCowboy Carter Tour.î

And the youngster is slaying it.

Social media is filled with videos of the teen, looking very much like her famous mom, hitting the choreography like a pro.

Two years ago, the eldest of the Carterís three children (twins Rumi and Sir are 7) was one of the dancers on her motherís ìRenaissance Tour.î

Her initial stage debut back then was critiqued by some who said the then 11-year-old was not yet up to the task.

In her documentary about that tour, BeyoncÈ explained that she was distressed that her daughter had read some of the negative critiques and also shared that her eldest had ìtold me she was ready to perform and I told her no.î

ìI did not think it was an appropriate place for an 11-year-old on the stadium stage,î the superstar singer said in the film. ìAll the things that I had to go through and the obstacles I had to overcome to prepare me and she hasnít had that struggle.î

BeyoncÈ said she was nervous about that first performance for her daughter.

But rather than fold under the pressure, Blue Ivy used the negativity that greeted her initial guest performances as fuel to improve her skills, according to her mother. Blue Ivy talked about it in the film.

ìI feel like now my mindset has changed and now I actually have to wake up in the morning and go to rehearsals,î she said.

It was not the first time the youngster has achieved greatness.

She was only nine years old in 2021 when she won her first Grammy for best music video for her motherís single, ìBrown Skin Girl,î on which Blue Ivy received a writing credit.

In 2013, she entered the Guinness Book of World Records as the youngest ever entrant on the Billboard charts as her ìbreathing, cries and coosî as a baby were included in her fatherís song, ìGlory.î",5-May-25,Entertainment,Lisa Respers France,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/05/entertainment/blue-ivy-cowboy-carter-tour,,,,,,,,,,,,welcome ‚Äúivy league‚Äù that‚Äôs fans blue ivy carter taken calling yearold daughter beyonc√© knowles carter husband rapperentrepreneur shawn ‚Äújayz‚Äù carter performing dancer mother‚Äôs ‚Äúcowboy carter tour‚Äù youngster slaying social media filled videos teen looking much like famous mom hitting choreography like pro two years ago eldest carter‚Äôs three children twins rumi sir one dancers mother‚Äôs ‚Äúrenaissance tour‚Äù initial stage debut back critiqued said yearold yet task beyonc√©s tour next heads chicago beyonc√©s tour next heads chicago mason poolepicturegroupshutterstock documentary tour beyonc√© explained distressed daughter read negative critiques also shared eldest ‚Äútold ready perform told no‚Äù ‚Äúi think appropriate place yearold stadium stage‚Äù superstar singer said film ‚Äúall things go obstacles overcome prepare hasn‚Äôt struggle‚Äù beyonc√© said nervous first performance daughter rather fold pressure blue ivy used negativity greeted initial guest performances fuel improve skills according mother blue ivy talked film beyonc√© stage opening night cowboy carter tour inglewood california related article beyonc√© kicks cowboy carter tour help two daughters ‚Äúi feel like now mindset changed now actually wake morning go rehearsals‚Äù said first time youngster achieved greatness nine years old won first grammy best music video mother‚Äôs single ‚Äúbrown skin girl‚Äù blue ivy received writing credit entered guinness book world records youngest ever entrant billboard charts ‚Äúbreathing cries coos‚Äù baby included father‚Äôs song ‚Äúglory‚Äù
3 Doors Down singer Brad Arnold announces stage 4 cancer diagnosis," 
Brad Arnold, the lead singer of the rock band 3 Doors Down, says he has been diagnosed with a form of kidney cancer.

Arnold shared the news in a video posted to his Instagram page Wednesday, saying he was diagnosed with stage 4 clear cell renal cell carcinoma.

He added that the cancer had metastasized into his lung.


ìThatís not real good,î he said, adding that he has ìno fearî and ìsincerely am not scared of it at all.î

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma is the most common type of kidney cancer, according to the Mayo Clinic.

Arnold said because of his diagnosis, the band is canceling their upcoming tour.

3 Doors Down was set to embark on a tour starting on May 15 in Daytona Beach. All dates have since been removed from the bandís official website, with a video of Arnoldís announcement in its place.

Arnold asked his followers and listeners to ìlift me up in prayer every chance you getî and joked that he should go listen to their 2008 song ìItís Not My Time.î

Creed singer Scott Stapp was among those who gave their support to Arnold in the comments section of his post.

ìIf anyone has the FAITH and STRENGTH to face this fight, itís YOU brother,î Stapp wrote. ìI think I can speak for all of us, we are lifting you up in prayer right now believing without doubt for your total healing!î

3 Doors Down formed in the mid-1990s, with Arnold as one of the founding members. The band is known for hit singles including ìHere Without You,î ìWhen Iím Goneî and ìKryptonite,î which peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 in the No. 3 spot.",7-May-25,Entertainment,Alli Rosenbloom,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/07/entertainment/3-doors-down-brad-arnold-cancer-diagnosis,,,,,,,,,,,,brad arnold lead singer rock band doors says diagnosed form kidney cancer arnold shared news video posted instagram page wednesday saying diagnosed stage clear cell renal cell carcinoma added cancer metastasized lung ‚Äúthat‚Äôs real good‚Äù said adding ‚Äúno fear‚Äù ‚Äúsincerely scared all‚Äù clear cell renal cell carcinoma common type kidney cancer according mayo clinic arnold said diagnosis band canceling upcoming tour doors set embark tour starting may daytona beach dates since removed band‚Äôs official website video arnold‚Äôs announcement place arnold asked followers listeners ‚Äúlift prayer every chance get‚Äù joked go listen song ‚Äúit‚Äôs time‚Äù creed singer scott stapp among gave support arnold comments section post ‚Äúif anyone faith strength face fight it‚Äôs brother‚Äù stapp wrote ‚Äúi think can speak us lifting prayer right now believing without doubt total healing‚Äù doors formed mids arnold one founding members band known hit singles including ‚Äúhere without you‚Äù ‚Äúwhen i‚Äôm gone‚Äù ‚Äúkryptonite‚Äù peaked billboard hot spot
"A-list directors, Trump tariffs and a Tom Cruise sequel: Everything you need to know about the Cannes Film Festival 2025","For a fortnight every May, Cannes hosts more stars than there are in heaven (or the old MGM backlot). This year the French film festival will be even glitzier than usual as a whoís-who of Hollywood talent descends on the CÙte díAzur to rub shoulders with the great and good of the international film community.

All signs point to a stellar year for Cannes, riding high off a strong showing at the Academy Awards, with filmmakers queuing up to hit the red carpet and risk the barbs of sleep-deprived critics.

The US contingent at the festival, which begins Tuesday, is large. Tom Cruise returns to Cannes three years after ìTop Gun: Maverickî with ìMission: Impossible ñ The Final Reckoning,î hoping to repeat the winning formula that propelled ìMaverickî to a billion dollars at the box office. No honorary Palme díOr for Cruise this time though; instead, that will be handed to Cannes habituÈ Robert De Niro, a year shy of the 50th anniversary of ìTaxi Driverî winning the Palme díOr. Spike Lee, who served as jury president in 2021 (not without incident) will also return with ìHighest 2 Lowest,î his riff on Akira Kurosawaís ìHigh To Lowî (1963), starring Denzel Washington as a music mogul targeted with a ransom plot.

ìHighest 2 Lowestî will play out of competition alongside Ethan Coen comedy ìHoney Donít!,î his follow up to last yearís ìDrive Away Dolls,î the second title in his so-called ìlesbian B-movie trilogy.î Whether itís simply a case of a stacked lineup, or quibbles over theatrical windows and French law (Leeís film will hit Apple TV+ in September, presumably nixing any chance of a cinema release in France), itís a sign of the festivalís rude health that these Cannes heavyweights arenít duking it out for a Palme díOr.

So, who is? Competition for the top prize signals a changing of the guard. Some Cannes stalwarts remain: two-time Palme winners the Dardennes brothers of Belgium with ìYoung Mothers,î Ukrainian Sergei Loznitsa with ìTwo Prosecutors,î and Scotlandís Lynne Ramsay (ìWe Need To Talk About Kevin,î ìYou Were Never Really Hereî), whose adaptation of Ariana Harwiczís novel ìDie, My Loveî stars Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson. Wes Anderson will also be in competition for the fourth time with ìThe Phoenician Scheme,î featuring some of his usual players (Bill Murray, Jeffrey Wright) and some delightful new additions (Riz Ahmed, Mia Threapleton, daughter of Kate Winslet). Add castmates Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansson, Benicio Del Toro, Willem Dafoe and more and youíve got the starriest red carpet of the festival.

Joachim Trier, who rose through the ranks at Cannes before bursting into the mainstream with multi-Oscar nominee ìThe Worst Person in the Worldî (2021) reunites with lead Renate Reinsve for the highly-anticipated ìSentimental Value,î which also stars Stellan SkarsgÂrd. Iranian auteur Jafar Panahi, whose 2011 film ìThis Is Not A Filmî was smuggled to the festival on a USB stick hidden inside a cake, will be back in competition with ìA Simple Accident,î his follow up to 2022ís ìNo Bears,î which won top prize at the Venice Film Festival. So too American indie queen Kelly Reichardt, last at Cannes with ìShowing Upî and now debuting ìThe Mastermind,î a period heist drama led by Josh OíConnor, who stars in two competition films ñ the other being ìThe History of Sound,î directed by South African Oliver Hermanus and co-led by Paul Mescal.


Hermanus is one of a slew of competition newcomers, including Spaniard Carla SimÛn, a Berlinale winner in 2022, debuting ìRomerÌa,î and German director Mascha Schilinski with ìSound of Falling.î The latter, previously titled ìThe Doctor Says Iím Alright, But Iím Feeling Blue,î follows four generations of women united by trauma, and has trailed significant buzz for months leading to the festival ñ even more notable given Schilinskiís low profile.

Reichardt, Ramsay, SimÛn and Schilinski are four of seven women directors nominated for the Palme this year ñ a third of the competition total and a positive step in the festivalís quest for better gender representation. None are following up a Palme díOr win like Julia Ducournau, though. Ducournauís ìTitaneî triumphed in 2021 and she returns with ìAlpha,î reportedly a body horror set against an AIDS epidemic. Already bought by NEON, audiences should expect another provocative film.

Speaking of, Ari Aster (ìHereditary,î ìMidsommarî) is making his Cannes bow with ìEddington.î Bearing a poster alluding to the AIDS crisis of the 1980s and rumored to be set during the Covid-19 pandemic, the movie reunites Aster with his ìBeau Is Afraidî star Joaquin Phoenix as a New Mexico sheriff in a standoff with Pedro Pascalís mayor.

The Palme díOr jury, led by French actress Juliette Binoche and featuring Halle Berry and ìSuccessionî actor Jeremy Strong, will be watching the field of 22 films and will announce a winner on May 24.

Talk of the town
Elsewhere at the festival, actors are stepping behind the camera. In the Un Certain Regard category for rising filmmakers, Kristen Stewart directs Imogen Poots in ìThe Chronology of Water,î an adaptation of Lidia Yuknavitchís memoir. Scarlett Johanssonís ìEleanor The Greatî stars June Squibb, and Harris Dickinson ñ last seen seducing Nicole Kidman in ìBabygirlî ñ writes and directs ìUrchin,î set on the streets of London. Also notable in Un Certain Regard is hot title ìMy Fatherís Shadow,î thought to be the first-ever Nigerian film in Cannesí official selection.

The festival has never hesitated to program films covering ongoing global events, and the Israel-Hamas war will be referenced on screen. Israeli director Nadav Lapid will bring his brand of social satire to the Directorsí Fortnight with ìYes!,î a film set in the aftermath of the October 7 attacks. Meanwhile, ìPut Your Soul On Your Hand And Walk,î by Iranian filmmaker Sepideh Farsi, screens in the ACID section and profiles war documentarian Fatima Hassouna. The film is already being viewed in a new light after Hassouna, who had covered the conflict on the ground in Gaza, was killed in an Israeli strike the day after the festival announced its lineup.

Thereís a heavy dose of reality behind the scenes too. Taking a step back from the premieres, Cannesí busy film market will likely be discussing whether President Donald Trumpís announcement that he intends to introduce tariffs on films ìproduced in Foreign Landsî will come to pass ñ and if so, how it could be implemented.

The award season kingmaker
Late-breaking US policy announcements aside, Cannes is swaggering into its latest edition. The festival screened close to 3,000 films to curate its official selection, and programmers shoehorned big name after big name into its lineup right up to the eleventh hour. A lot would have to go wrong for 2025 not to be a vintage year.

Whisper it quietly, but itís been quite the turnaround. For much of the aughts, Cannes was locked in a not-so Cold War with the Venice Film Festival over who could bag the most exciting titles. Cannes was fighting with one hand tied behind its back; Venice had ñ has ñ an open-door policy to the big-spending streamers, while Cannes said ìnonî to including them in its competition lineup. Quickly, Venice became seen as the starting gun for awards season.

But then Cannes had a notable win with Bong Joon Hoís ìParasite,î the 2019 Palme díOr winner and winner of best picture at the Academy Awards in 2020 ñ the first non-English language best picture winner, and the first film to achieve the Cannes-Oscar double since ìMartyî in 1955. The festival, a champion of world cinema, which normally positions itself above the insular tastes of the Academy, knew the significance of the moment. It was a win-win, repositioning Cannes in the Oscars conversation without having to compromise the festivalís mission.

Since then, Cannes has been on an Oscars roll (no doubt aided by the internationalization of the Academy). Including ìParasite,î four of the last five Palme díOr winners have been best picture nominees. Oscar-winners ìAnatomy of a Fallî and ìThe Zone of Interestî premiered at Cannes in 2023, while last yearís edition featured ìThe Substance,î ìEmilia Perez,î ìFlowî and ìAnora,î which swept the Academy Awards and achieved the best picture and Palme díOr double. Cannes will never need the Oscars, but the validation doesnít hurt.

For all the glamor and its A-list guests, the festivalís greatest asset is its ability to pluck a hit from nowhere and set a director and their movie on a dizzying trajectory. What will break out in 2025? We donít know yet ñ and thatís why itís all so exciting.

"Mississippi town where Sinners is set lacks a movie theater, but it may still get a screening","Clarksdale, Mississippi ñ which serves as inspiration for the setting of the Michael B. Jordan-starring film ìSinnersî ñ does not have a local cineplex, which led community organizer Tyler Yarbrough to ask the filmmakers and studio behind the project to host a screening in the city.

Yarbrough, along with Clarksdale mayor Chuck Espy, spoke to CNNís Victor Blackwell for the ìArt is Lifeî segment on Saturday, and shared their hopes that the screening will become a reality.

ìClarksdale is a ways away from a movie theater,î Yarbrough said in an interview, later adding that it took him about an hour and a half to drive to a theater that was showing the film.


Espy pointed to depopulation and lack of funds as contributing factors to the loss of Clarkdaleís two movie theaters, also detailing that most community-and family-centered venues started gravitating toward Memphis, Tennessee, some 80 miles away.

ìIím really excited for the opportunity to have potentially cast members to come and to give people an opportunity to have a real feeling and a real dialogue, so they can immerse themselves in something that the country has not seen,î he shared, referencing the heritage of his city.

ìA lot of people are at the table to try to bring this to fruition,î he also said. ìPeople from over a 2-hour radius are talking about coming to Clarksdale to see this event.î

Neither Espy nor Yarbrough said any plans for the screening have been finalized, but Yarbrough mentioned ìseveral conversationsî he has been a part of with ìWarner Bros. executives.î He said the screening is ìlooking very promisingî to happen sometime between now and Juneteenth, but no details have been confirmed.

ìWe are asking Michael B. Jordan the rest of the cast. Weíre talking about studio execs,î Espy said. ìEvery single person that has touched this wonderful film launched a great release. Weíre asking them to come to Clarksdale.î

CNN has reached out to Warner Bros. Pictures for comment about the potential screening.

ìSinners,î a period piece/crime thriller/vampire horror hybrid from ìBlack Pantherî director Ryan Coogler, has dominated the box office and garnered positive reviews. The film is produced and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, which is owned by CNNís parent company Warner Bros. Discovery.

In it, 1930s Mississippi is seen as a burgeoning and fertile place where blues music is created, as characters perform in moving cars and a juke joint is thrown together for the community to enjoy.

ìClarksdale is a melting pot. It has so many people that come from New Zealand, Australia, all around the world for the authentic feel of the blues,î Espy shared, later adding that the cityís legacy ìhas been going on for over a hundred years about the heritage of the Mississippi delta and the rich legacy of the blues.î

ìSo people come from all around the world just to touch the sacred soil of this city, to say ëI was there, where the blues was born.íî

Yarbrough also mentioned how in a perfect world, he would be able to convince the ìSinnersî production team and cast to not only come for a screening and conversation, but also to explore some of what contemporary Clarksdale has to offer.

ìWe also wanted the cast to come down and experience our juke joints, to experience our museums like the Blues Museum,î among other things, he said.

ìI really love a part of the movie that Coogler captured very well was just showing how the blues is the foundation. And you saw one scene where he intertwined all the different genres, from from hip-hop to pop to rock into this one scene, and thereís a lot of power in that that locals need to see,î Yarbrough said. ìAnd so I think when it comes to this screening and everything, too, weíre really trying to connect local folks, Deltans, to that power. So we can remember that weíre powerful.î

Barry Keoghan says Beatles legend Ringo Starr played the drums for him during their first meeting,"Barry Keoghan finally got to meet Ringo Starr, who he is set to portray in the upcoming Beatles biopics, and the two ìjust sat in the garden chatting awayî during the meeting.

Keoghan appeared on Wednesdayís episode of ìJimmy Kimmel Live!î and told the late night host that he only recently met the Beatles drummer for the first time at his home, and that Starr even played the drums for him.

ìHe asked me to play but I wasnít playing the drums for Ringo,î Keoghan said, adding that Starrís private drum performance ìjust kind of naturally happenedî and that ìit was sort of one of those moments where youíre just in awe.î


Keoghan admitted his nerves got the best of him and that at one point he told Starr he ìcouldnít look at him.î Eventually, the ìSaltburnî actor started to relax so that he could absorb what Starr is like in real life to help him craft his portrayal in the Sam Mendes-directed suite of biopics.

ìMy job is to observe and take in all kinds of mannerisms and study him,î Keoghan said. ìI want to humanize him and bring feelings to him and not just sort of imitate.î

In November, Starr broke the news that Keoghan was cast to portray him during an interview with Entertainment Tonightís Kevin Frazier, saying he thought it was ìgreatî that Keoghan got the part and that he believed he was ìsomewhere taking drum lessons.î

Mendes has been tapped to direct four separate biopics chronicling the story of The Beatles from each band memberís point of view, which will collectively ìintersect to tell the astonishing story of the greatest band in history,î according to an announcement from Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE).

SPE announced the full cast last month, confirming that ìBabygirlî star Harris Dickinson will play John Lennon, Paul Mescal will portray Paul McCartney, and ìStranger Thingsî star Joseph Quinn will play George Harrison, in addition to Keoghanís portrayal of Starr.

The films are being billed by Sony executive Tom Rothman as ìthe first bingeable theatrical experience,î and are set to hit theaters in April 2028.

Pierce Brosnans time with Robin Williams filming Mrs. Doubtfire was wilder than we knew,"Pierce Brosnan only ever appeared with Robin Williams in one film, but the Irish actor now says he didnít quite work with Williams.

ìI really never worked with Robin Williams,î Brosnan recalled recently. îI only worked with Mrs. Doubtfire.î

The star rewatched some of his old films during a chat with Vanity Fair, including his beloved 1993 comedy ìMrs. Doubtfireî in which Williams plays a father who poses as a female nanny in order to spend time with his children after his wife seeks a divorce.


Brosnan played Stuart ìStuî Dunmeyer, a man who starts dating the estranged wife of Williamsí character Miranda, played by Sally Field.

ìI mean, the very first day that I was on set up in San Francisco. They said, ëDo you want to meet Robin?í I said, ëYeah, Iíd love to meet him,íî Brosnan said. ìAnd I went into the makeup trailer, and Robin was sitting there in a Hawaiian shirt ó and his kind of haired arms hanging out and his hairy legs ó but had the head of Mrs. Doubtfire.î

Williams went to all lengths to stay with his children in the 1993 movie ""Mrs. Doubtfire.""

Brosnan said Williams teased him with Mrs. Doubtfireís accent saying, ìOh, Pierce, youíre so handsome. Come here, give us a kiss,î before transitioning to a manís deeper voice and saying, ìHey baby, whatís happening?î

ìHe jumped all over the place,î Brosnan mused.

It was typical of Williams to push the envelope, apparently. The star did just that in a scene in which his Mrs. Doubtfire teases Brosnanís character about wanting to have sex with Miranda.

ìThereís reams of footage of me just kind of falling around on the floor with laughter, and he went really blue,î said Brosnan, who also called Williams ìsuch a kind-hearted man.î ìHe really was quite colorful, because the children werenít there, and it was just Robin and myself, and he knew he had me in the crosshairs with his humor. I loved the man.î

Williams died at the age of 63 in 2014.

Cassie Ventura and Alex Fineís powerful love story is rooted in a shared adversity," 
Cassie Ventura has Sean ìDiddyî Combs to thank, in part, for finding the true love of her life.

Venturaís husband, Alex Fine, was Combsí personal trainer before he became Venturaís trainer, which led to them falling in love. The two wed in 2019, after her tumultuous relationship with Combs played out, off and on, between 2007 and 2018.

Based on their social media posts and interviews, the relationship Fine and Ventura share is in direct contrast to the horror she says she suffered at the hands of Combs. As she has testified about those allegations in the federal sex-trafficking trial against Combs this week, Venturaís husband has been in court supporting her, much like he vowed to do in an open letter he shared on social media in 2019.

ìI promise you that I will do every single thing in my power to support you and help you,î he wrote at the time. ìI promise that you will never be alone. I promise that you will be loved beyond expectation and we will show our children how to be in a healthy relationship.î

Loving ìPoonieî
Fine has a nickname he utilizes as his social media handle on Instagram.

ìIím Alex to everyone, but to close friends Iím ëPoonie,í a nickname Iíve had since I was young,î he told Zero magazine.


In Fine, Ventura found a man who could sympathize with the violence she has said she was subjected to by Combs. Attorneys for Combs have said the violence in his relationship with Ventura was ìmutual.î

In a March 2020 post on his Almost Home site, Fine explained why he chose to run a 50-mile marathon to raise money for his domestic violence charity, inspired by experiences his beloved mother had suffered.

ìWhen I got the news that my mom had been the victim of domestic abuse and violence, I really didnít know how to handle it,î he wrote at the time.

Fine said his ìangerî over the abuse is mother endured deeply affected him.

ìI didnít want to give in to those paralyzing feelings,î he wrote. ìSo, I decided to channel my anger and feelings of helplessness by running fifty miles to bring awareness and hopefully raise some money for other victims of domestic violence.î

That type of sensitivity was on hand when he proposed to Ventura in 2019.

ìI knew that Alex was designing a ring, but I honestly wasnít expecting a super elaborate proposal because we already had the wedding date set, but he planned such a beautiful experience for me,î she told Vogue. ìI was so surprised!î

A cowboy at heart, the trainer turned model and actor was on location with the Compton Cowboys and asked Ventura to meet him for what turned out to be a surprise proposal.

ìHe told me to come ready because we were driving straight to dinner to celebrate my birthday early that night as my family was coming into town,î she recalled. ìI was running a little late, so he called me to check in.î

Ventura said she heard a Stevie Wonder song playing and spotted ìthe guys on their horses waving at me.î

ìI looked up and saw our initials tied up above them, then Alex came around on his horse. When he got down on one knee, everything just stopped,î she told the publication. ìI felt like I lost my sense of hearing; I just saw his mouth moving, and he said ëI want to spend the rest of my life with you.íî

They then went to Playa del Rey, where Fine had arranged for two of their friends to set up dinner and a bonfire on the beach.

ìI will never forget how special Alex made me feel that night,î Ventura said.

ìBeing a dad and husband is the greatest thing Iíve ever doneî
Fine has continued to show Ventura that she is unrivaled in his affection.

They are the parents of two daughters, Frankie 5, and Sunny, 3. Ventura is due to give birth to their third child soon.

ìIím a father, husband, and actor,î he told Zero. ìFamily and work take the most importance and focus in my life. I became the man I am today a lot from the environment I grew up in. My mom and dad are the best.î

ìBeing a dad and husband is the greatest thing Iíve ever done and I donít know how I got to be so blessed,î Fine said.

Ventura has returned the praise.

In honor of Fatherís Day last year, she shared a series of photos and video of Fine.

ìThere is just no one like you,î Ventura wrote in the caption.

Fine paid a public tribute to his wife on their third wedding anniversary.

ìIím so lucky that I got to marry my best friend and most beautiful wife in the world. Every morning I wake up and see you and the babies I get so happy,î he wrote in the caption of a series of wedding photos.

On Wednesday, Fine appeared stoic as he left the Manhattan courthouse of the Combs trial, where his wife has spent more than eight hours testifying so far about her troubled past relationship with the embattled music industry vet.

ìSheís holding up strong,î Douglas Wigdor, Venturaís attorney, told reporters outside court.

When asked how Venturaís husband was doing, he said, ìput yourself in his shoes.î

Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. His defense team has said they may call Fine to the stand to testify.

UK court orders singer Chris Brown held in custody over 2023 London nightclub fight charge,"Grammy-winning singer Chris Brownís upcoming tour was thrown into question Friday as a British judge ordered him held in custody while facing allegations that he beat a music producer with a bottle in a London nightclub in 2023.

Brown, 36, appeared in Manchester Magistratesí Court to face one count of causing grievous bodily harm and was ordered held until his next hearing June 13 in London ñ the same day heís due to take the stage in Frankfurt, Germany, on the third date of his world tour.

Judge Joanne Hirst rejected Brownís bail request after prosecutor Hannah Nicholls said that the crime was ìextremely serious.î


Brown was on tour in the UK in February 2023 when he is alleged to have attacked producer Abe Diaw with a bottle at the Tape nightclub, in Londonís Mayfair neighborhood.

Defense attorney Grace Forbes argued that the American performer wasnít a flight risk and should be released.

Brown was flanked by court officers in the dock. His hair was bleached blonde and he wore sweatpants and a black T-shirt. He confirmed his name and birth date, and said that his address was the local Lowry Hotel, where he was arrested early Thursday and taken into custody.

His case was transferred to Southwark Crown Court in London, where he is expected to enter a plea to the charge.

Brownís representative didnít immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.

Brown, often called by his nickname Breezy, burst onto the music scene as a teen in 2005 and has become a major hitmaker over the years with notable songs such as ìRun It,î ìKiss Kissî and ìWithout You.î

"Stephen ëDemoí DeMaria, a set builder for ëSNLí for 50 years, is hanging up his hammer","
Stephen ìDemoî DeMaria has been at ìSaturday Night Liveî from before the late-night show even premiered.

The now 87-year-old Brooklyn native helped build the audience seats for the showís Oct. 11, 1975 premiere, according to The Gothamist.

He talked to the publication about his plan to retire on Saturday after ìSNLísî 50th season wrap party.


ìI gotta shake Lorne Michaelís hand,î DeMaria said of the showís creator and producer. ìHe gave me a future for 50 years.î

DeMaria rose from building seats to foreman, earning the nickname of ìThe Boss of The Carpenters.î

ìThe first 12 years was the best shows for ëSNL,íî DeMaria said.

ìMy favorite sets were the ones with John Belushi, with the restaurant, and Eddie Murphy, with that little apartment he used to come down, open the door,î he continued, referencing the famous ìOlympia Restaurantî and ìMister Robinsonís Neighborhoodî sketches from the show.

Part of the reason he is leaving, he said, are the hours the job requires.

He receives the plans for the sketches around 2 a.m. on Thursdays and he and his crew then work to make sure everything is built and ready by Saturday night.

ì?Now I donít have to get up at 4:30, take a shower, this that, get to work and I can just take it easy,î he said. ìDo what I gotta do.î

Nicole Stiegelbauer is his boss on the show and told the publication her grandfather initially hired DeMaria. She said she was surprised he continued to work after the 2022 death of his wife of 60 years, Patricia.

ìHe has come here rain, snow, sleet, sickness, health, whatever thing thatís ever happened, he has still managed to come and make sure the office runs the way itís supposed to,î Stiegelbauer said. ìIíve known him quite literally my entire life.

"The good, the bad and the raunchy: All 26 Eurovision songs, ranked from worst to first","Did you enjoy the papal conclave for its politicking, its gaudy hats and its general focus on peace and love, but think: ìInstead of picking a pope, I wish these cardinals would step into some cheetah-skin body suits and gyrate suggestively on an exercise ball in a debasing appeal for my vote?î

We ask you, then, to fix your attention on Basel, Switzerland, where rainbow-colored smoke confirms that the Eurovision Song Contest is back after an all-too-long 12 months away.

Eurovision is catty, competitive and eternally controversial. Itís ridiculous, as seasoned fans will attest. Itís also full of heart, and a showcase of jaw-plunging talent. And itís long. Itís extremely long. Twenty-six countries will compete in a four-hour grand final, one of the defining events on the LGBTQ+ cultural calendar.

TOPSHOT - Swiss singer Nemo representing Switzerland with the song ""The Code"" celebrates on stage after winning the final of the 68th Eurovision Song Contest (ESC) 2024 on May 11, 2024 at the Malmo Arena in Malmo, Sweden.

Swiss singer Nemo won Eurovision last year, for their epic operatic ballad ""The Code."" Tobias Schwarz/AFP/Getty Images
We couldnít possibly ask you to make sense of it all yourself. So, your intrepid reporter ñ covering Eurovision for his seventh year ñ has crafted this utterly subjective ranking of every act taking the stage for the final. And we have help ñ from none other than last yearís winner, Nemo, who won gold for their genre-busting pop-opera ìThe Code.î

This yearís field is absolutely bursting with sex, energy, sex, emotional ballads and sex. ìItís a very horny year,î Nemo notes. ìI love that for all the performers.î

Letís get into it.

26. Armenia: PARG, ìSurvivorî
If Imagine Dragons are your idea of edgy rock, youíll find PARG only mildly uncool. PARG (and weíre sorry for shouting, but he insists on all-caps) spends most of this performance topless on a treadmill, mostly in color, but sometimes ñ DRAMATICALLY ñ in black and white. He is, technically, a very handsome man, but thereís something vaguely AI-generated about his whole aesthetic; if a rogue state funded a large language model and tasked Patrick Bateman with its development, PARG would be selected as the purest example of a human adult male. The songís terrible, by the way.

PARG!

25. San Marino: Gabry Ponte, ìTutta LíItaliaî
Just 33,000 people live in San Marino, so adults fit enough to seductively rotate their hips face high odds of being conscripted. But usually, the nation will look to their Italian neighbors for help. ìWe share a lot of art and culture,î Gabry Ponte, an Italian, tells CNN.

And ladies and gentlemen, we have a chart-topper in our midst. Remember the infuriatingly addictive 1998 hit ìBlue (Da Ba Dee)?î That was this guy! Ponte, then of Eiffel 65, returns just 27 years later with ìTutta LíItalia,î which talks ñ not at all reductively ñ about ìSpaghetti, wine, Our Father and the Mona Lisa.î

24. United Kingdom: Remember Monday, ìWhat The Hell Just Happened?î
I regret to inform you that the Brits, once again, have hope. No amount of merciless rejection can crush it. And hereís the good news: The UK has a tendency to select melodically challenged competitors, but these girls can sing.

""What The Hell Just Happened"" is both the name of Remember Monday's entry and the sentiment that will echo across Europe once they've left the stage.

The problem? Itís a dreadful song. The staging is inexplicably dull. The change-of-pace chorus grows tiresome fast. Thematically, the whole thing is stuck in 2013, vapidly dissecting a party like the early hangover-pop of Kesha and Katy Perry. But times have changed. Kesha now makes empowered, critically acclaimed art-pop. Perry is a self-proclaimed authority on astrology and astronomy and the stars.

This song is a lazy facsimile of a bygone era that doesnít treat Eurovision fans with the respect they deserve. Disaster is looming for Britain; they just donít realize it yet.


23. Portugal: Napa, ìDeslocadoî
No election can pass without controversy these days, and Portugalís success in the semi-final left even the most seasoned Eurovision fans nonplussed. This song is perfectly nice ñ it wouldnít be out of place on your Sunday morning playlist ñ but thereís nothing in the staging that elevates it.

22. Lithuania: Katarsis, ìTavo Akysî
ìThe foundations of everything have already begun to rot,î Katarsisí vocalist screams. ìYour eyes see pain.î Itís brooding. Itís a little boring. Katarsis is clearly working through something, and thatís great, but if Eurovision is a party, he is the contestant you donít really want to get caught in conversation with.

21. Germany: Abor & Tynna, ìBallerî
Germany wonít win Eurovision, but they do win CNNís coveted award for the competitionís worst lyrics. ìI shoot holes into the night; stars fall and bang on my roof,î Abor & Tynna ñ a brother and sister duo ñ sing nonsensically. ìChalk silhouettes on the sidewalk; A crime scene between us, like on ëCSI.íî Musically this is a sneaky banger, but the live performance doesnít elevate it.

20. Israel: Yuval Raphael, ìNew Day Will Riseî
The biggest headaches facing organizers again revolve around Israelís participation, which is opposed by segments of the fanbase due to its ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza. Yuval Raphael survived the militant groupís attack at the Nova music festival on October 7. Sheíll be singing to an arena in which Palestinian flags will be flying, after a rule change by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU); organizers will be hoping the performance passes without incident. This is the second consecutive Israeli ballad that makes implicit reference to Hamasí attacks, but on a musical level, itís the weaker of the pair.

19. Spain: Melody, ìEsa Divaî
The so-called Big Five ñ the UK, Spain, Germany, France and Italy ñ qualify for the final automatically thanks to their financial contributions to the EBU. But if money can buy access, it doesnít guarantee points. Melodyís staging is fabulous, and this song is a hot, chaotic mess (complimentary), but itís hard to see either jury or televoter falling for it. Diva down.

18. Iceland: V∆B, ìRÛaî
Futuristic shout-pop pair V∆B bring energy ñ potentially a bit too much energy ñ and theyíll likely be deployed by producers to shake TV viewers out of a ballad-induced slumber. But thatís where their use ends.


V∆B will give you a headache.

17. Norway: Kyle Alessandro, ìLighterî
Nineteen-year-old Kyle Alessandro is an energetic performer. But the lyrics read like theyíve been put through Google Translate 16 times, which is some achievement, given that heís singing in English.

16. Poland: Justyna Steczkowska, ìGAJAî
Justyna Steczkowska returns to Eurovision 30 years after first representing Poland, and her performance is bewitching; she dangles above the stage, pulls off a series of demanding moves and even (pretends to) play the violin. But vocally, itís a touch on the screamy side.

15. Latvia: Tautumeitas, ìBur Man Laimiî
Two hugely positive trends stand out in this yearís Eurovision field: the aforementioned raunchiness and the sheer number of songs sung in and inspired by national languages and cultures. Fewer tracks are in English this year; drab ballads laden with clunky metaphors still exist, but theyíre harder to find. Instead, we get interesting stuff like this: a six-woman fairy-inspired ethno-pop group melding Latvian folk imagery with an ethereal chant and an impeccably-rehearsed dance routine. Itís bold and ñ full disclosure ñ it wonít work for everyone. But itís exactly what Eurovision should be about.

14. Greece: Klavdia, ìAsterom·taî
A haunting ballad about the emotional toll of displacement, which needs a few listens to truly appreciate. Itís ambitious and personal, and Klavdiaís vocals are top drawer.

13. Netherlands: Claude: ìCíest La Vieî
If Claude makes it onto the stage, heís already one-upped last yearís Dutch entrant, Joost, who was disqualified moments before the show after an altercation, the details of which remain shrouded in mystery. Bouncing between English and French is a bit of a naked play to the juries, but this chorus is moreish and itís impeccably sung.

12. Ukraine: Ziferblat, ìBird of Prayî
Ukraine excels at Eurovision like nobody else. This song is bold ñ it might be the hardest entry to pin down musically. The costumes are pure glam rock, but even camper; the melodies zoom around and never end up quite where youíd expect. An acquired taste, but Nemo likes it: ìOne of the most interesting (songs) musically ñ itís very daring, bold, but beautiful.î

11. Estonia: Tommy Cash, ìEspresso Macchiatoî
ìNo stresso, no stresso, no need to be depresso,î Tommy Cash tells us with infuriating frivolity in a gimmicky spectacle that caricatures Italian coffee culture. The song caused a brief diplomatic incident, as Eurovision entries often do, with some in Italy bristling at the lazy stereotypes on show. But Tommy insists that what heís hearing is ìmostly loveî and that somewhere around ì0.2%î of Italians feel offended (he didnít share his methodology). ìIím never depresso,î he tells CNN. But he concedes that ìsometimes, you can get stresso.î You wonít want to like this song, but you probably will.

Tommy Cash claims he's never ""depresso,"" but admits it ""comes with life"" to be ""a little bit stresso sometimes."" He says Italy loves his track. But let's face it, this is about as culturally sensitive as screaming ""How you say, late checkout!?!"" at a bewildered hotel receptionist.

10. Malta: Miriana Conte, ìServingî
This song was called ìKant,î until the EBU ñ apparently not fans of the German philosopherís theory of transcendental idealism ñ forced it to change. Gen Z readers will know the slang phrase that Miriana Conte is alluding to anyway, and she lives up to it, strutting the stage in a furious cloud of girlbossery and diving into some impressive, Ariana Grande-esque vocal acrobatics. The arrangement is very 2015, and itís all a touch on the nose, but it mostly works. ìShe has this amazing aura,î says Nemo. ìShe owns it.î

""Serving"" is an energetic, if a little dated, Maltese effort that has shades of ""Je Me Casse,"" a similarly buzzy entry from 2021.

9. Denmark: Sissal, ìHallucinationî
Denmarkís long national nightmare is over. The competitionís longest absence from the final (they last qualified in 2019) has been snapped by a fabulous, epic, searing ballad that deserves far more love than itís getting. Itís good through headphones, but itís much better live.

8. Sweden: KAJ, ìBara Bada Bastuî
Sweden are Eurovisionís perennial powerhouse; this year, theyíre represented by a Finnish three-piece who took the qualification process in their neighboring country by storm. ìWeíre gonna sauna, sauna, steam it up,î KAJ sing on a giant sauna set. And itís not an act ñ these guys really love the sauna. ìItís great for mental health, physical health, itís a great way to meet friends,î Jakob NorrgÂrd tells CNN. ìIím part of a sauna community,î adds Axel ≈hman. ìYou meet all kinds of people.î

This song is the favorite and itís been endorsed by Finlandís president ñ which is awkward, since the country has its own contestant. Itís undeniably catchy, but we canít place it on the same pedestal as previous Swedish victors like ABBA and Loreen.

At least it has a serious public health message. ìEverybodyís welcome in our sauna. We could stay in there for hours, if itís a competition,î NorrgÂrd says, before his tone shifts deadly serious. ìBut you should never compete in the sauna. Itís a bad idea.î

KAJ's song, set and message all seem to revolve around the sauna. It's a gag lifted from K‰‰rij‰, Finland's fan favorite 2023 contestant, who had a sauna driven to Liverpool, England for the final.

7. Luxembourg: Laura Thorn, ìLa PoupÈe Monte Le Sonî
A bouncy, fun and severely underrated twist on classic. This track from Laura Thorn (titled ìThe Doll Turns Up The Soundî in English) is a playful riposte to Luxembourgís own 1965 Eurovision winner, ìWax doll, rag doll,î retaking the agency that was lacking in the lyrics France Gall delivered six decades ago. It would be a crime if this didnít do well.

6. Italy: Lucio Corsi, ìVolevo Essere Un Duroî
If Lucio Corsi were representing a less chic nation, weíd assume heíd responded to the Swiss summer by overapplying his sunscreen. But heís Italian, so weíre inclined to think his look is a nod to a Pierrot pantomime clown, a la an ìAshes to Ashesî era David Bowie. Either way, itís a beautiful song (titled ìI Wanted to Be Toughî in English) that plays with themes of masculinity and self-image ñ and itís Nemoís favorite. ìItís too much under the radar ñ I donít get why people havenít clocked it yet,î they tell CNN. ìIt really touches me.î

Corsi's song is a beautiful and gentle effort that subverts traditional ideas around masculinity.

5. France: Louane, ìMamanî
The devil works hard, but Eurovisionís publicists work harder. Per the biography distributed to media members, we learn that Louane ìis considered more than just an artist: She has been called a bridge between the personal and the universal.î Whoís called her this? Did it just slip out naturally, after a couple of pints? What does it even mean?

What matters is that France have once again found a gem, with a touching ballad dedicated to Louaneís late mother. The nation has flirted with Eurovision success with recent entries like ìVoil‡,î ìMon amour,î ìJíai cherchÈî and ìMercyî (we get it, France, youíre French). This could top them all.

4. Switzerland: ZoÎ MÎ, ìVoyageî
Countries never win back-to-back, which is a shame, because this is stunning. A gentle ballad by a Basel-born star ñ gorgeously sung and cinematically shot ñ this will stand out amid its chaotic competitors. ìThe core of ëVoyageí is (about) spreading kindness,î ZoÎ MÎ tells CNN. ìI really believe in the song.î ìItís so emotionally captivating,î adds Nemo.

3. Finland: Erika Vikman, ìIch Kommeî
If the title of Erika Vikmanís romp ìIch Kommeî ñ German for ìIím comingî ñ doesnít spell out the themes at play here, sheís on hand to explain. ìThe song is literally about an orgasm,î Vikman tells CNN. What are they putting in the water in Basel?

Power, sexuality, female empowerment and expression are all explored in this randy and rambunctious number. A giant, pyro-spraying microphone hammers the message home.

""Ich Komme"" is one of many severely horny entries this year.

2. Austria: JJ, ìWasted Loveî
The classically-trained JJ boasts some stunning operatic vocals chords and the song plays to his strengths, climaxing in a truly thrilling cacophony. ìI had a pretty tough year, and I wanted to write about my personal experience with wasted, unreciprocated love,î he tells us. Itís the best song at the competition.

But hereís the rub: Eurovision hates even a whiff of mimicry, and this song is far too similar to ìThe Code.î It may still come out on top, but consecutive winners rarely sound this alike. Nemo, for his part, is diplomatic: ìI think itís such a nice thing for Eurovision artists to continue to inspire each other.î

JJ is hoping that a pop-opera ballad wins Eurovision for the second year in a row. His song is fantastic -- but will voters fall for the same trick twice?

1. Albania: Shkodra Elektronike, ìZjermî
An intense bald gentleman and a songstress who looks to have dabbled in a cult or two form Eurovisionís unlikeliest pairing.

They sing about an oasis ñ ìThereís no ambulance around the street, no one talks to you arrogantlyî ñ clearly oblivious to the British bachelor parties that blight Tirana, Albaniaís capital.

Shkodra Elektronike could capitalize on a weaker-than-average field to claim a shock win for Albania. Beatrice Gjergji told CNN: ìThe emotions are big, the stage is big, the pressure... itís big.î

And they must be huge Eurovision fans, right? ìNo, not at all,î BeatriÁe Gjergji tells CNN. ì(Itís) not our type of music.î

Frankly, their ambivalence is an asset: there is nothing else like this performance on offer, and theyíre getting deserved buzz from fans as a result. ìIf you believe in the type of music you love, maybe something can happen,î Gjergji says.",16-May-25,Entertainment, Rob Picheta,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/16/entertainment/eurovision-2025-final-songs-rankings-cmd-intl,,,,,,,,,,,,enjoy papal

Bruce Springsteen says Trump is ëunfití and ëincompetentí in remarks during UK show,"Rock megastar Bruce Springsteen has made a series of critical remarks about US President Donald Trump and the policies of his administration, calling the American leader ìunfitî for office.

ìThe mighty E Street Band is here tonight to call upon the righteous power of art, of music, of rock ní roll in dangerous times,î Springsteen said at the beginning of a concert in Manchester, northern England, on Wednesday.

ìIn my home, the America I love ó the America Iíve written about that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years ó is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration,î he said.

ìTonight, we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American spirit to rise with us, raise your voices against authoritarianism,î added Springsteen.

The rock star spoke out several times during the show, later posting clips of his comments to his Instagram account.

ìThe last check on power, after the checks and balances of government have failed, are the people ó you and me. Itís in the union of people around a common set of values. Now thatís all that stands between democracy and authoritarianism. So at the end of the day, all weíve really got is each other,î he continued.

He later criticized some of the US administrationís most recent policies.

ìIn America, the richest men are taking satisfaction in abandoning the worldís poorest children to sickness and death. This is happening now,î he said.

ìIn my country, they are taking sadistic pleasure in the pain that they inflict on loyal American workers, theyíre rolling back historic civil rights legislation that led to a more just and plural society,î he said.

Bruce Springsteen slams Trump while urging Americans to vote for Harris

ìTheyíre abandoning our great allies and siding with dictators against those struggling for their freedom. Theyíre defunding American universities that wonít bow down to their ideological demands. Theyíre removing residents off American streets, and without due process of law, are deporting them to foreign detention centers and prisons. This is all happening now,î added Springsteen.

The singer also criticized US lawmakers for failing to protect the American people from what he called ìan unfit president and a rogue government,î and having ìno concern or idea of what it means to be deeply American.î

ìThe America that Iíve sung to you about for 50 years is real and, regardless of its faults, is a great country with a great people, so will survive this moment,î said Springsteen.

The Manchester show was the first on the European leg of Springsteen and the E Street Bandís ìLand of Hope and Dreamsî tour, which will also take in dates in France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the Czech Republic.

Springsteen previously criticized Trump and urged Americans to vote for Kamala Harris at a campaign rally for the Democratic candidate last year.

Robert De Niro hits out at Trump in Cannes speech,"Hollywood actor Robert De Niro has used his award acceptance speech at the Cannes Film Festival to criticize US President Donald Trump.

De Niro, 81, was receiving the Palme díOr lifetime achievement award at the event in the south of France on Tuesday when he called Trump a ìphilistine president.î

ìIn my country, we are fighting like hell for the democracy we once took for granted,î said De Niro to an audience including some of the biggest names in showbiz.


ìThat affects all of us here, because the arts are democratic, art is inclusive and brings people together, like tonight. Art looks for truth. Art embraces diversity, and thatís why art is a threat,î added De Niro, who is an outspoken critic of the US president.

ìThatís why we are a threat to autocrats and fascists. Americaís philistine president has had himself appointed head of one of our premier cultural institutions (the Kennedy Center). He has cut funding and support to the arts, humanities and education,î he continued.

De Niro also took aim at Trumpís reported plan to impose tariffs on movies produced outside the US


ìYou canít put a price on creativity, but apparently you can put a tariff on it. Of course, this is unacceptable. All of these attacks are unacceptable,î he said.

Creed singer Scott Stapp was among those who gave their support to Arnold in the comments section of his post.

Additionally, Alley starred in a number of memorable films, like the ìLook Whoís Talkingî movies, 1990ís ìMadhouseî and 1999ís ìDrop Dead Gorgeousî with Ellen Barkin.

ëHer charisma was always iconicí
John Travolta, who costarred with Alley in 1989ís hit ìLook Whoís Talkingî as well as two sequels, wrote on Instagram on Monday, ìKirstie was one of the most special relationships Iíve ever had. I love you Kirstie. I know we will see each other again.î

Jamie Lee Curtis ñ who worked with Alley in 2016 on episodes of TVís ìScream Queensî ñ shared a statement on Facebook to pay tribute to the late actress, writing, ìShe was a great comic foil in @tvscreamqueens and a beautiful mama bear in her very real life. She helped me buy onesies for my family that year for Christmas. We agreed to disagree about some things but had a mutual respect and connection. Sad news.î

Josh Gad tweeted, ìMy heart breaks for Kirstie and her family. Whether it was her brilliance in ëCheers; or her magnetic performance in the ëLook Whoís Talkingí franchise, her smile was always infectious, her laugh was always contagious and her charisma was always iconic. RIP.î

Alleyís ìCheersî co-star Ted Danson told Deadline he had just watched Alley in an episode of the show while on a plane before learning of her death.

ìI was on a plane today and did something I rarely do. I watched an old episode of ëCheers,íî Danson told the outlet. ìIt was the episode where Tom Berenger proposes to Kirstie, who keeps saying no, even though she desperately wants to say yes. Kirstie was truly brilliant in it. Her ability to play a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown was both moving and hysterically funny.î

ìShe made me laugh 30 years ago when she shot that scene, and she made me laugh today just as hard. As I got off the plane, I heard that Kirstie had died. I am so sad and so grateful for all the times she made me laugh,î Danson added. ìI send my love to her children. As they well know, their mother had a heart of gold. I will miss her.î

Another ìCheersî star, Rhea Perlman, told CNN in a statement that she and Alley became friends instantly on the set of ìCheers.î

ìKirstie was a unique and wonderful person and friend. Her joy of being was boundless,î Perlman said. ìWe became friends almost instantly when she joined the cast of Cheers. She loved kids and my kids loved her too. We had sleepovers at her house, with treasure hunts that she created. She had massive Halloween and Easter parties and invited the entire crew of the show and their families. She wanted everyone to feel included. She loved her children deeply. Iíve never met anyone remotely like her. I feel so thankful to have known her. Iím going to miss her very, very much.î

ìBaywatchî actor Parker Stevenson, who was married to Alley from 1983 to 1997 and is the father of her two children, also paid tribute to her on social media. In an Instagram post, confirmed to be Stevensonís by a representative for the actor, he wrote: ìKirstie, I am so grateful for our years together, and for the two incredibly beautiful children and now grandchildren that we have.

John†Travolta†and†Kirstie†Alley:†A†love†story,"Kirstie Alley and John Travolta were never romantically involved, but that wasnít how she initially wanted it.

Alley, who died Monday at the age of 71 after a brief illness, often talked of her feelings for Travolta, whom she called the ìgreatest loveî of her life.

The pair starred together ìLook Whoís Talkingî film franchise (the first movie hit theaters in 1989). During an appearance in 2018 on ìCelebrity Big Brother U.K.î, Alley talked about how easy it is to fall in love with leading men.


She named two co-stars she said she developed feelings for, but never fully consummated the attraction: Patrick Swayze and Travolta.

ìI almost ran off and married John. I did love him, I still love him,î Alley said. ìIf I hadnít been married I wouldíve gone and married him and I wouldíve been in an airplane because he has his [own plane.]î

The same year she appeared on the reality show, the ìCheersî star also talked about Travolta during a conversation on ìThe Dan Wootton Interviewî podcast. She said not sleeping with the movie star was ìthe hardest decision Iíve ever made because I was madly in love with him.î


ìWe were fun and funny together,î she said. ìIt wasnít a sexual relationship because Iím not going to cheat on my husband.î

Alley was married to actor Parker Stevenson at the time. The couple divorced in 1997.

In 2013, Alley told Howard Stern Travolta also had feelings for her, but didnít act on them because of her marriage.

ìIt took me years to not look at John as a romantic interest,î she said.

Travolta married actress Kelly Preston in 1991. Alley told Wooten that Preston put her foot down about her flirting with her husband.

ìKelly came up to me and they were married then, and she said, ëWhy are you flirting with my husband?íî Alley said. ìAnd that was sort of when I had to make a decision and that was pretty much the end of that.î

Travolta paid tribute to Alley on social media Monday.

ìKirstie was one of the most special relationships Iíve ever had,î he wrote in the caption on a post on his verified Instagram account. ìI love you Kirstie. I know we will see each other again.î",6-Dec-22,Entertainment,Lisa Respers France,https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/06/entertainment/john-travolta-kirstie-alley/index.html,,,,,,,,,,,,kirstie alley john travolta never romantically involved wasn‚Äôt initially wanted alley died monday age brief illness often talked feelings travolta called ‚Äúgreatest love‚Äù life pair starred together ‚Äúlook who‚Äôs talking‚Äù film franchise first movie hit theaters appearance ‚Äúcelebrity big brother uk‚Äù alley talked easy fall love leading men named two costars said developed feelings never fully consummated attraction patrick swayze travolta ‚Äúi almost ran married john love still love him‚Äù alley said ‚Äúif hadn‚Äôt married would‚Äôve gone married would‚Äôve airplane plane‚Äù year appeared reality show ‚Äúcheers‚Äù star also talked travolta conversation ‚Äúthe dan wootton interview‚Äù podcast said sleeping movie star ‚Äúthe hardest decision i‚Äôve ever made madly love him‚Äù ‚Äúwe fun funny together‚Äù said ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt sexual relationship i‚Äôm going cheat husband‚Äù alley married actor parker stevenson time couple divorced alley told howard stern travolta also feelings didn‚Äôt act marriage ‚Äúit took years look john romantic interest‚Äù said travolta married actress kelly preston alley told wooten preston put foot flirting husband ‚Äúkelly came married said ‚Äòwhy flirting husband‚Äô‚Äù alley said ‚Äúand sort make decision pretty much end that‚Äù travolta paid tribute alley social media monday ‚Äúkirstie one special relationships i‚Äôve ever had‚Äù wrote caption post verified instagram account ‚Äúi love kirstie know see again‚Äù

"Ashton†Kutcher†and†twin†Michael†talk†health,†guilt†and†rift†between†them","
In a rare interview, twin brothers Ashton and Michael Kutcher talked about both their bond and their rift.

The pair appeared on the new Paramount+ series ìThe Checkup with Dr. David Agus.î

Agus, who is Ashton Kutcherís doctor, first spoke with the actor about his battle with the autoimmune condition vasculitis.

Later he sat down with the brothers to talk about Michael Kutcher having cerebral palsy and also the moment he almost died as a youngster after contracting viral myocarditis that caused his heart to become enlarged and fail.

The brothers both got emotional about Michaelís heart stopping while Ashton was visiting him in the intensive care unit.

ìI go in the room and Iím like ëWhoa,íî Ashton Kutcher said, fighting back tears. ìIím likeÖíEverything is not ok.í And he flatlines in the room and I know that noise cause now Iíve been visiting occasionally.î

He said he considered jumping off a balcony to help his brother since his heart would be a match. Michael Kutcher did receive a donor heart in 24 hours.

He later had to have open heart surgery after a blood clot was discovered. Meanwhile, Ashton Kutcherís career as a model and actor started taking off and he said he felt guilt.

The ìThat 70s Showî star said he wondered, ìHow do I get to be this lucky?î

ìFor my brotherÖto be born with cerebral palsy, then have a heart transplant, then have this random blood clot, these things that youíre just like, ëWho has to go through that?,íî he said.

Michael Kutcher eventually called him out, he said.

ìHe looked at me and he said, ëEvery time you feel sorry for me, you make me less,íî Ashton Kutcher said. ìHe said ëThis is the only life Iíve ever known, so stop feeling sorry for the only thing I have.í And that then created an entire shift back to where I think we are today, which is straight up equals again.î

Michael Kutcher told Agus the brothers drifted apart because of jealousy on his part after his brother became ìa household name.î

ìThere was a moment when I viewed him as receiving more attention than I was,î Michael Kutcher said. ìThat kind of drove me down to a place where I was jealous.î

The brothers talked it through, Michael Kutcher said, adding, ìAnd once I took all of the fame and everything out of it, I was able to just, you know, come back to him.î

They also had an issue after the actor shared publicly that his brother had cerebral palsy, something Michael Kutcher had not shared. Ashton Kutcher said during the interview that he was not aware that his brother had been keeping it a secret.

Michael Kutcher is now an advocate for the disabled.

Gabourey†Sidibe†reveals†she's†been†secretly†married†for†over†a†year," 
It turns out that Gabourey Sidibe has been even busier than previously thought since the beginning of the pandemic.

Not only did the Oscar-nominated actress get engaged, she also secretly got married well over a year ago.

The ìbreaking newsî was revealed during a lively interview on ìLive with Kelly and Ryanî on Monday, in which Sidibe revealed further details on her now husband Brandon Frankelís engagement proposal in late 2020, as well as their secret wedding in March 2021.


ìThe thing about weddings is I donít like them. I donít like them,î the ìPreciousî star explained to the hosts. ìHereís an example of how much I donít like them: Iím actually married. We got married over a year ago.î

The revelation left Ryan Seacrest ìconfused,î while Kelly Rippa asked if this was indeed ìbreaking news.î

Frankel, an entertainment business executive, was seen in the audience, confirming the news by raising his hand to show a bejeweled ring finger.


Sidibe went on to share that they were married ìat the kitchen table,î and the ceremony was so small, it was ìjust us.î

She did allow that they will eventually have a wedding to placate her mother-in-law, but that her distaste for the affairs stems from the fact that the actressís own mother was a wedding singer, meaning sheís ìbeen at a lot of weddings, uninvitedî herself.

Frankel posted a series of pictures of the couple showing off their rings to his Instagram also on Monday, writing, ìSURPRISE! I can finally call her my WIFE publicly!î

He went on to say that after Sidibe ìspilled the beansî on ìLive,î he feels ìrelieved we can finally tell the world.î

ìSo thankful to have found my forever person, my partner-in-crime, and the love of my life. Every day is the best day with you,î Frankel added. ìNobody I would rather raise cats with and be in bed by a smooth 8pm with. Love you foreverî

He also shared, ìI donít think you can be a star and be that available.î


It was part of a larger conversation in which Clooney identified how certain movie stars that came before him like Gregory Peck and Paul Newman ñ both of whom were friends of his before they died ñ exemplified how to carry oneself in the spotlight.

ìIt doesnít mean you canít be goofy and do stupid things, but it means stand up for the things you believe in, carry yourself with a little bit of dignity,î the ìTicket to Paradiseî star said. ìAnd both of them had great humor about themselves.î

Clooney, who is being honored at the Kennedy Center this month alongside Gladys Knight and U2, among others, is active in humanitarian efforts in addition to his pursuits as an actor, producer and director.


Ethan Hawke, who directed Clooney in a voice role as Newman in this yearís HBO documentary ìThe Last Movie Stars,î observed that itís no surprise heís getting such a prestigious honor. (CNN and HBO Max are both part of the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)

ìItís interesting that heís getting the Kennedy Center Honors this year because Newman got it too. They fit in a long line of really responsible artists, people who make a contribution to American culture and are civic leaders,î Hawke told the Post. ìWhether you like Georgeís politics, or admire where he gives his money and time, you have to admire his willingness to lead, and his willingness to care.î

Steven Soderbergh, whose 1998 masterpiece ìOut of Sightî starred Clooney opposite Jennifer Lopez, said the actor is unique for not caring that his politics might compromise the reach of his stardom.

ìThe default mode really doesnít lead you to a place of thinking about fairness, or defending people who canít defend themselves. Itís great when people use that juice for those purposes, but thatís not the way the stream flows,î Soderbergh said of Clooneyís efforts through his Clooney Foundation for Justice alongside wife Amal, a human rights attorney.

ìThe stream flows in the direction of self-orientation and being in a mode of extracting whatever you can from this business, and whatever you can from the world at large. Ö Heís one of the few people who punches upward. Thatís rare.î

Ben†Affleck†says†Netflix's†'assembly†line'†approach†to†making†quality†films†is†'an†impossible†job'," 
Ben Affleck is sounding off on how movies are being made in todayís age of Netflix and other streaming platforms, which offer an ever-expanding glut of content.

The actor, producer and director, who is starting a new film studio of his own with friend and colleague Matt Damon alongside RedBird Capital Partners, shared his take on Netflixís approach to moviemaking, which he likened to an ìassembly line.î

Making films ìis a thing that requires attention and dedication and work and it resists the sort of assembly line process,î Affleck shared in reference to Netflix, while attending the New York Times 2022 DealBook Conference last week.


ì[Netflixís head of original films] Scott Stuber is a really talented, smart guy who I really likeÖbut itís an impossible job,î he added.

The ìArgoî star also said that if you ask Netflix co-CEO and chairman Reed Hastings about their ambitious approach of making 50 great movies, ìheíd say, ëHey, we went for quantity to establish a footprint.í Iím sure thereís wisdom in that and Iím sure they had a great strategy, but I would have said, ëHow are we going to make 50 great movies a year? How is that possible?í Thereís no committee big enough. There arenít enough ñ you just canít do it.î

Affleck acknowledged that ìthereís (a) bigger audience for action movies than there is for small dramas. I get that. Certain genres play more broadly and you canít not be mindful of that. But letís do a good one, letís surprise the audience, letís make them care about it.î

At Artists Equity, which is being branded as a creator-led studio, Affleck and company hope to reimagine the relationships between studios, artists and crews working in the industry.

As seen in Variety, Artists Equity already has a first project in production ñ a yet-to-be-titled drama about the beginnings of Nikeís incredibly popular Air Jordan sneaker brand. Written and directed by Affleck, the film stars Damon as the executive who landed the endorsement deal for the shoe with Chicago Bulls superstar Michael Jordan.

Keke†Palmer†reveals†baby†bump†as†part†of†her†'Saturday†Night†Live'†opening†monologue,"Some†people†like†singing†th
Some people like singing their good news from the rooftops, but in Keke Palmerís case, it was done on live television in front of millions of viewers.

The actress and comedian hosted ìSaturday Night Liveî this weekend, and during her opening monologue, revealed she is pregnant with her first child.

The ìHustlersî star wore a trench coat with snap buttons and said she wanted ìto set the record straightî about some ìrumors going aroundî that sheís having a baby.


ìI am!î she continued, whipping open her coat to reveal her bare baby bump underneath.

While closing the clasps on her coat, Palmer then added, ìI gotta say, it is bad when people on the Internet spread rumors about you, but itís even worse when theyíre correct!î

She then joked how she had been trying to keep her pregnancy on the ìdown lowî for fear of losing some sponsorship deals, including one with a liquor label.

ìLet the check clear, and then we can get to the damn baby shower,î she joked.

Palmer hosted the long-running NBC comedy sketch show alongside musical guest Sza.

Bits from the show included a cold open mocking Herschel Walker, a PSA-style sketch for exes of Drake, and a short at the Hello Kitty store with Palmer and Bowen Yang as employees who canít get over the fact that Hello Kitty isnít a cat.

Christine†McVie's†music:†5†songs†to†listen†to†in†her†honor,"
Thereís a reason why Christine McVie was considered the heart of Fleetwood Mac.

The bandís keyboardist, who died Wednesday after a brief illness at the age of 79, was also the writer of some of the groupís most beloved songs.

Here are just five of those tunes:


ìYou Make Loving Funî
This one is tied to some drama.

Fleetwood Mac is known for, in part, their tumultuous relationships, especially when it came to romantic ones.

Band members Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham had a thing that ended badly and McVie was famously married to, and then divorced from, their other bandmate, John McVie.


He reportedly thought the song, with its lyrics ìSweet wonderful you/You make me happy with the things you do/Oh, can it be so/This feeling follows me wherever I go,î was about their dog as the McVies were married at the time.

But it turns out Christine McVie had penned the love song in honor of the bandís lighting director with whom she had an affair.

ìDonít Stopî
Another tune from their famed ìRumoursî album.

ìDonít Stopî proved to be a hopeful anthem for the future, which was so meaningful to former President Bill Clinton that he used it as his 1992 campaign anthem.

On Wednesday he tweeted a tribute to McVie.

ìIím saddened by the passing of Christine McVie. ìDonít Stopî was my í92 campaign theme song - it perfectly captured the mood of a nation eager for better days,î he tweeted. ìIím grateful to Christine & Fleetwood Mac for entrusting us with such a meaningful song. I will miss her.î

ìGot a Hold on Meî
This one was actually a solo song for McVie.

The first single off of her self-titled solo album, it sounds like it could be a Fleetwood Mac song with itís buoyant rhythm and the infectious chorus, ìOoh, I got a love/I got somebody/This love got a hold on me.î

Plus Buckingham plays guitar on this one, giving it even more of a Fleetwood Mac vibe.

ìSay You Love Meî
ìSay You Love Meî is a jaunty tune that has become a mainstay on rock and easy listening radio stations.

She reflected on the sweet harmonies, she, Nicks and Buckingham achieve on the tune in a 1990 interview.

ìThe first time I started playing ëSay You Love Meí and I reached the chorus, they started singing with me and fell right into it,î Performing Songwriter magazine reported her saying. ìI heard this incredible sound, our three voices Ö and my skin turned to gooseflesh.î

ìSongbirdî
It feels right that so many on social media used this song to pay tribute to McVie after her passing.

The ballad she wrote has been pointed to as the perfect remembrance of someone lost.

Playing it now after her death seems haunting as she pours her heart into the opening lyrics, ìFor you, thereíll be no more crying/For you, the sun will be shining/And I feel that when Iím with you/Itís alright, I know itís right.î

Axl Rose is ending a 30-year Guns Ní Roses tradition.

The bandís frontman recently posted a note saying on social media that he would no longer be tossing his microphone into the crowd during their concerts after it came to his attention that a fan may have been hurt at their recent show in Adelaide, Australia.

ìIf true, obviously we donít want anyone getting hurt or to somehow in any way hurt anyone at any of [our] shows anyway,î Rose wrote in a note he tweeted. ìHaving tossed the mic at the end of [our] show for over 30 years we always felt it was a known part of the very end of [our] performance that fans wanted and were aware of to have an opportunity to catch the mic.î


He thanked the bandís supporters for understanding.

In the new teaser trailer for ìIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,î Harrison Ford returns as the titular hero archaeologist, this time alongside ìFleabagî star Phoebe Waller-Bridge.

In this fifth installment, directed by James Mangold, Jones jumps back into action ñ albeit seemingly reluctantly ñ to once again go on a grand adventure, despite thinking that his risk-taking days have ìcome and gone.î

Antonio Banderas, John Rhys-Davies, Shaunette Renee Wilson and Mads Mikkelsen are part of the cast for the new movie.

Steven Spielberg and George Lucas served as executive producers, with John Williams, who has scored each Indy adventure since the original ìRaiders of the Lost Arkî in 1981, once again serving as composer.

Back in September, Ford appeared at Disneyís D23 convention and teased the action to come.

'Willow'†revives†the†Lucasfilm†fantasy†with†a†more†contemporary†streaming†adventure,"
Disneyís press materials refer to the original 1988 movie ìWillowî as ìbeloved,î which despite its admirers feels like nostalgic inflation of a pretty generic George Lucas-plotted fantasy that provided an early directing showcase for Ron Howard. Setting that aside, a Disney+ revival series isnít without its charms, in a more contemporary narrative that brings back Warwick Davis while focusing on the next generation.

The series begins by recounting the events of the movie, which saw Davisí simple farmer Willow turn sorcerer and join in a fierce battle to protect a baby who carried the kingdomís destiny on her tiny shoulders, overcoming ancient evil with the help of the swordsman Madmartigan and (eventually) princess Sorsha. The latter were played by Val Kilmer and Joanne Whalley, respectively, who as an off-screen bonus got married after the film.

Kilmer, amid his struggle with cancer, remains out of the picture, but Whalley returns as the now-queen and mother of two headstrong grown children, who play roles in a mythical quest that requires journeying across treacherous lands to thwart the evil crone.


As for the aforementioned baby, Elora Danan, she has grown up in anonymity, ìSleeping Beautyî-like, to protect her, although her identity (a not-to-be-revealed spoiler) soon becomes known. The quest includes a colorful band with plenty of youthful relationship issues, including Princess Kit (Ruby Cruz), who is secretly in love with the knight charged with training her (Erin Kellyman, whose credits include Lucasfilmís ìSolo: A Star Wars Storyî); and Boorman (Amar Chadha-Patel), an irreverent brawler in the Madmartigan mode.

Jonathan Kasdan (who also worked on ìSoloî) serves as showrunner, collaborating with four directors who each oversaw back-to-back episodes. As constructed, ìWillowî draws upon the original while weaving in flourishes that recall the ìLord of the Ringsî movies, including lots of sweeping green countryside and abundant, occasionally quite-violent action.

As is so often the case with the growing subgenre of expanded-to-series sequels, this ìWillowî at times feels as if itís spinning its wheels, devoting lengthy stretches to Willow guiding the now-older Elora to master her powers, which he presents as the only hope of saving the kingdom. And while Kilmerís absence leaves a sizable hole Kasdan and company do a reasonably good job of filling it, including the late arrival of another knight (Christian Slater) with whom Madmartigan shared some history.

Beyond modern-sounding dialogue and situations, the story does exhibit plenty of playful irreverence and humor mixed in among the action sequences and elaborate fantasy production design. The latter in particular suggest that this revival was no small undertaking, and to its credit, it looks like that money ended up on the screen.

While that combination doesnít add up into making ìWillowî significantly worthier of the ìbelovedî label than its late-í80s predecessor, consumed on its own unpretentious terms, itís easy enough to like.

ìWillowî premieres November 30 on Disney+.

'Love†Actually'†director†feels†'a†bit†stupid'†about†movie's†lack†of†diversity,"
Every year, as the days grow colder and Christmas draws nearer, ìLove Actuallyî quickly becomes a festive favorite on peopleís television screens.

But nearly 20 years on from the release of the 2003 romantic comedy, the movie has faced scrutiny over its story lines and lack of diversity.

ìThere were things youíd change but thank god society is changing. So my film is bound, in some moments, to feel, you know, out of date,î the movieís writer and director Richard Curtis said earlier this week.

He was speaking to Diane Sawyer as part of a documentary on ABC News titled: ìThe Laughter & Secrets of Love Actually: 20 Years Later.î

ìLove Actuallyî features interweaving story lines, following several romantic relationships. However, most of the leading cast is White and all the relationships depicted are heterosexual.

Asked about any moments that might make him ìwince,î Curtis said: ìThe lack of diversity makes me feel uncomfortable and a bit stupid.î He added: ìI think there are three plots that have bosses and people who work for them.î

The movie features an impressive number of big names from the entertainment industry, with Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Keira Knightley, Bill Nighy, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Martin Freeman, Laura Linney, Martine McCutcheon, Rowan Atkinson and Thomas Brodie-Sangster all appearing at some point.

Nearly 20 years on, ìLove Actuallyî remains popular, becoming a staple of the holiday season.

ìItís amazing the way itís entered the language,î Nighy said in the ABC News documentary.

ìIíve had people coming up to me saying ëit got me through my chemotherapy,í or ëit got me through my divorce,í or ëI watch it whenever Iím alone.í And people do, and people have ëLove Actuallyí parties.î

When asked if she understood why ìLove Actuallyî had remained popular, Thompson replied: ìI so do.î

ìBecause I think that we forget, time and time again we forget, that love is all that matters.î

Curtis has written several other popular romantic comedies, including ìFour Weddings and a Funeral,î ìNotting Hillî and ìBridget Jonesís Diary.î

ìFour Weddings and a Funeralî was released in 1994 and notably portrayed a same-sex relationship between Matthew, played by John Hannah, and Gareth, played by Simon Callow.

Writing in the Guardian 14 years later, Callow said: ìIt almost defies belief, but in the months after the release of the film, I received a number of letters from apparently intelligent, articulate members of the public saying that they had never realised, until seeing the film, that gay people had emotions like normal people.î",1-Dec-22,Entertainment,Issy Ronald,https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/entertainment/love-actually-richard-curtis-diversity-scli-intl/index.html,,,,,,,,,,,,every year days grow colder christmas draws nearer ‚Äúlove actually‚Äù quickly becomes festive favorite people‚Äôs television screens nearly years release romantic comedy movie faced scrutiny story lines lack diversity ‚Äúthere things you‚Äôd change thank god society changing film bound moments feel know date‚Äù movie‚Äôs writer director richard curtis said earlier week speaking diane sawyer part documentary abc news titled ‚Äúthe laughter secrets love actually years later‚Äù love actually red nose day related article red nose day founder says love actually short easy sell ‚Äúlove actually‚Äù features interweaving story lines following several romantic relationships however leading cast white relationships depicted heterosexual asked moments might make ‚Äúwince‚Äù curtis said ‚Äúthe lack diversity makes feel uncomfortable bit stupid‚Äù added ‚Äúi think three plots bosses people work them‚Äù movie features impressive number big names entertainment industry alan rickman emma thompson hugh grant chiwetel ejiofor keira knightley bill nighy colin firth liam neeson martin freeman laura linney martine mccutcheon rowan atkinson thomas brodiesangster appearing point hugh grant plays british prime minister falls love assistant played martine mccutcheon hugh grant plays british prime minister falls love assistant played martine mccutcheon universaldnaworking titlekobashutterstock nearly years ‚Äúlove actually‚Äù remains popular becoming staple holiday season ‚Äúit‚Äôs amazing way it‚Äôs entered language‚Äù nighy said abc news documentary ‚Äúi‚Äôve people coming saying ‚Äòit got chemotherapy‚Äô ‚Äòit got divorce‚Äô ‚Äòi watch whenever i‚Äôm alone‚Äô people people ‚Äòlove actually‚Äô parties‚Äù asked understood ‚Äúlove actually‚Äù remained popular thompson replied ‚Äúi do‚Äù ‚Äúbecause think forget time time forget love matters‚Äù curtis written several popular romantic comedies including ‚Äúfour weddings funeral‚Äù ‚Äúnotting hill‚Äù ‚Äúbridget jones‚Äôs diary‚Äù ‚Äúfour weddings funeral‚Äù released notably portrayed samesex relationship matthew played john hannah gareth played simon callow writing guardian years later callow said ‚Äúit almost defies belief months release film received number letters apparently intelligent articulate members public saying never realised seeing film gay people emotions like normal people‚Äù
Joe†Pesci†says†playing†Harry†in†the†'Home†Alone'†films†came†with†some†'serious'†pain," 
They say artists have to be willing to do anything for their art, and for Joe Pesci, that includes setting his head on fire.

In a new interview with People, the Oscar winner reflected on the making ìHome Alone 2: Lost in New Yorkî on the occasion of the sequelís 30th anniversary and remembered how the comedy required some physically ìdemandingî stunts on his part.

ìIt was a nice change of pace to do that particular type of slapstick comedy,î Pesci said of making the first two ìHome Aloneî films in the email interview, published on Tuesday.


In the uber-successful franchise, Pesci played one half a bungling thief duo (alongside Daniel Stern) who is continually one-upped by a clever kid played by Macaulay Culkin. He acknowledged that the movies ìwere a more physical type of comedy, therefore, a little more demanding.î

One example ñ when Pesciís character Harry walks unsuspectingly into a booby trap laid by Culkinís Kevin, leading to a fiery finish.

ìIn addition to the expected bumps, bruises, and general pains that you would associate with that particular type of physical humor, I did sustain serious burns to the top of my head during the scene where Harryís hat is set on fire,î the ìGoodfellasî star recalled.

In fact, Harryís head is set ablaze not once but twice in the movies, once in 1990ís ìHome Aloneî and again in the 1992 film, when Harry and Marv (Stern) chase Kevin through a house amid renovations. (Pesci did not clarify during which film he sustained his injury.)

Inside†Christine†McVie's†and†Stevie†Nicks'†decades-long†friendship,"
Throughout the various personal turmoils for which the members of Fleetwood Mac are known, one relationship buoyed the band for decades: the friendship between its two frontwomen, Christine McVie and Stevie Nicks.

McVie joined the band in 1970 during one of its early lineup changes and for years was its only woman. When Nicks was added to the lineup in 1975, the two became fast friends.

Theirs was not a competitive relationship, but a sisterly one ñ both women were gifted songwriters responsible for crafting many of the bandís best-known tunes. Though the two grew apart in the 1980s amid Nicksí worsening drug addiction and the bandís growing internal tension, they came back together when McVie returned to Fleetwood Mac in 2014.


At a concert in London, shortly before McVie officially rejoined the band, Nicks dedicated the song ìLandslideî to her ìmentor. Big sister. Best friend.î And at the showís end, McVie was there, accompanying her bandmates for ìDonít Stop.î

ìI never want her to ever go out of my life again, and that has nothing to do with music and everything to do with her and I as friends,î Nicks told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune in 2015.

On Wednesday, McVie, the bandís ìsongbird,î died after a brief illness at age 79. Below, revisit McVieís and Nicksí years-long relationship as bandmates, best friends and ìsisters.î

McVie and Nicks hit it off from the start
The story of Nicks joining Fleetwood Mac is legend now: Band founder and drummer Mick Fleetwood wanted to recruit guitarist Lindsey Buckingham, who stipulated that he would only join if his girlfriend and musician Nicks could join, too. McVie cast the deciding vote, and the rest is history.

ìIt was critical that I got on with her because Iíd never played with another girl,î McVie told the Guardian in 2013. ìBut I liked her instantly. She was funny and nice but also there was no competition. We were completely different on the stage to each other and we wrote differently too.î

Throughout the bandís many personal complications ñ McVie married and divorced Fleetwood Mac bassist John McVie and had an affair with the bandís lighting director, while Nicks had rollercoaster romances with Buckingham and Fleetwood ñ they were each otherís center.

ìTo be in a band with another girl who was this amazing musician ñ (McVie) kind of instantly became my best friend,î Nicks told the New Yorker earlier this year. ìChristine was a whole other ballgame. She liked hanging out with the guys. She was just more comfortable with men than I had ever been.î

The two protected each other, Nicks said, in a male-dominated industry: ìWe made a pact, in the very beginning, that we would never be treated with disrespect by all the male musicians in the community.

ìI would say to her, ëTogether, we are a serious force of nature, and it will give us the strength to maneuver the waters that are ahead of us,íî Nicks told the New Yorker.

The band succeeds but McVie and Nicks grow distant
ìRumoursî was the bandís greatest success to date when it was released in 1977. But the bandís relationships with each other were deteriorating, save for the one between McVie and Nicks. While the pair were enduring breakups with their significant others, Nicks and McVie spent their time offstage together.

The Guardian asked McVie if she was trying to offset the bandís tumult with her songs on ìRumours,î including the lighthearted ìYou Make Loviní Funî and optimistic ìDonít Stop.î She said she likely had been.

As multiple membersí drug use intensified, the bandís dynamic grew tense. McVie distanced herself from the group in 1984 amid her bandmatesí addictions, telling the Guardian she was ìjust sick of it.î Nicks, meanwhile, was becoming dependent on cocaine.

McVie told Rolling Stone that year that sheíd grown apart from Nicks: ìShe seems to have developed her own fantasy world, somehow, which Iím not part of. We donít socialize much.î

In 1986, Nicks checked into the Betty Ford Center to treat her addiction, though she later became addicted to Klonopin, which she said claimed years of her life. She quit the prescription drug in the 1990s.

After recording some solo works, McVie returned to Fleetwood Mac for their 1987 album ìTango in the Night,î and two of her songs on that record ñ ìLittle Liesî and ìEverywhereî ñ became major hits. But Nicks departed the band soon after, and the bandís best-known lineup wouldnít officially reunite until 1997 for ìThe Danceî tour and subsequent live album.

The reunion was short-lived: After the band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1998, McVie officially quit Fleetwood Mac, citing a fear of flying and exhaustion of life on the road.

McVie returns to Fleetwood Mac ñ and to Nicksí side
In the 2010s, after more than a decade of retirement, McVie toyed with returning to performing. She officially rejoined Fleetwood Mac after calling Fleetwood himself and gauging what her return would mean for the group.

ìFortunately Stevie was dying for me to come back, as were the rest of the band,î she told the Arts Desk.

In 2015, a year after sheíd rejoined Fleetwood Mac, McVie hit the road with her bandmates. Touring with the group was tiring but fun, the first time theyíd performed together in years.

ìIím only here for Stevie,î she told the New Yorker that year.

Nicks concurred: ìWhen we went on the road, I realized what an amazing friend sheíd been of mine that I had lost and didnít realize the whole consequences of it till now,î she told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune in 2015.

During that tour, McVie wore a silver chain that Nicks had given her ñ a ìmetaphor,î McVie told the New Yorker, ìthat the chain of the band will never be broken. Not by me, anyways. Not again by me.î

McVie told the Arts Desk in 2016 that she and Nicks were ìbetter friends now than (they) were 16 years ago.î

Touring with Buckingham and Fleetwood could quickly get tumultuous for Nicks, McVie said, due to their shared history. ìBut with me in there, it gave Stevie the chance to get her breath back and not have this constant thing going on with Lindsey: her sister was back,î she said.

Their mutual praise continued: In 2019, McVie said Nicks was ìjust unbelievableî onstage: ìThe more I see her perform on stage the better I think she is. She holds the fort.î

When their 2018-2019 tour ended, though ñ without Buckingham, who was fired ñ the band ìkind of broke up,î McVie told Rolling Stone earlier this year. She added that she didnít speak with Nicks as often as she did when they toured together.

As for a reunion, McVie told Rolling Stone that while it wasnít off the table, she wasnít feeling ìphysically up for it.î

ìIím getting a bit long in the teeth here,î she said. ìIím quite happy being at home. I donít know if I ever want to tour again. Itís bloody hard work.î

Nicks remembers her ëbest friendí McVie
News of McVieís death rattled Nicks, who wrote that she had only found out McVie was sick days earlier. She called McVie her ìbest friend in the whole world since the first day of 1975.î

On her social media accounts, Nicks shared a handwritten note containing lyrics from the Haim song ìHallelujah,î some of which discusses grief and the loss of a best friend.

ìSee you on the other side, my love,î Nicks wrote. ìDonít forget me ñ Always, Stevie.î",1-Dec-22,Entertainment,Scottie

While promoting his forthcoming film ìEmancipation,î Smith called it ìa horrific nightî and said he ìlost itî when he stormed the stage and slapped presenter Chris Rock.

ìAnd I guess what I would say, you just never know what somebody is going through,î Smith said. ìI was going through something that night. Not that that justifies my behavior at all.î


Smith said that what was most painful to him was that his actions made it ìhard for other people.î

ìAnd itís like I understood the idea where they say hurt people hurt people,î he said.

ìThat was a rage that had been bottled for a really long time,î Smith said.


Noah pointed out how Smith had written in his memoir about growing up being afraid of conflict and the talk show host also noted the negative things that have been said about Smith and his family on the internet.

The music of the night will continue for eight weeks longer than expected.

The Broadway musical ìThe Phantom of the Operaî announced in September that it would be closing in February because of declining ticket sales, but plans have changed.

On Tuesday, the showís producer, Cameron Mackintosh, announced the show will now run until April 16.


An unexpected bolster in sales, as well as a busy Thanksgiving week, helped the longest-running show in Broadway history earn $2.2 million in sales last week, according to The New York Times.

ìWhat a phenomenal response there has been to the show ending,î Mackintosh told the Times. ìWeíve sold out virtually everything that we have on sale.î

The musical will celebrate its 35th anniversary in January.


With music by famed composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, ìPhantomî features a masked music lover who haunts the Paris Opera House.

Kim†Kardashian†and†Kanye†West†reach†divorce†settlement,"Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have come to a divorce agreement, a source with knowledge of the negotiations tells CNN.

Per the agreement, a draft of which was obtained by CNN, Kardashian will receive $200,000 per month in child support from West, who last year legally changed his name to Ye, and share joint custody of their four children.

CNN has reached out to representatives for Kardashian and West for comment.


Kardashian filed for divorce from West in February 2021, citing irreconcilable differences.

The couple was married in a lavish wedding in Italy in 2014.

In March 2022, Kardashian was declared legally single after being granted a request to change her marital status.


In an interview with Vogue earlier this year, the Skims founder explained what led to her high-profile split, saying, that ìfor so long, I did what made other people happyî and that she decided ìIím going to make myself happy.î

She went on to say that ìeven if that created changes and caused my divorce, I think itís important to be honest with yourself about what really makes you happy.î

ìIíve chosen myself,î she told the publication. ìI think itís okay to choose you.î

In September, West, who in the latter part of this year has lost multiple business partnerships following a string of antisemitic comments, publicly apologized to Kardashian in an interview with ìGood Morning Americaî for ìany stressî heís caused her.

Marsai†Martin†and†Omari†Harwick†play†to†win†in†'Fantasy†Football'," 
The new film ìFantasy Footballî capitalizes on some of its stars natural talent.

Marsai Martin channels lots of girl-boss energy playing Callie Coleman, a tech-savvy young woman whose fatherís long career in the NFL lands him with the Atlanta Falcons team.

Her production company is behind the family-friendly film. (Martin, 18, set a Guinness World Record in 2020 as the youngest Hollywood executive producer to work on a major production.)


She and costars Omari Hardwick (Bobby Coleman), Rome Flynn (Anderson Fisher), along with the filmís director Anton Cropper, recently spoke with CNN when they appeared at a Falcons game held at Mercedes Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia.

It was familiar surroundings as the group shot plenty of scenes for their movie there.

The plot centers around Callieís father, played by Hardwick, seemingly at the end of his career when his daughter discovers she can control his moves via playing the Madden football video game.

Martin sees the role in which her character also makes friends with the robotics club team members at her new school as more than just fun with its positive message about diversity in technology.

ìIíve met so many girls who are in to technology and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) or are all about Black girls coding,î she said. ìItís important to shine a light on it because itís a very big deal. Itís all about representation.î

For Hardwick, the project gave him the opportunity to lean into his football roots.

Before he became famous for his work in roles like James ìGhostî St. Patrick on ìPower,î the Savannah, Georgia native played as a defensive back at the University of Georgia and later tried out with the San Diego Chargers as an undrafted free agent.

ìIt feels incredible to be right back here at home,î Hardwick said. ìThis is obviously my hometown teamÖbut I never got to play for the Falcons. With this film, I got to do my thing.î

Hardwick also pointed out that it was appropriate that they were attending a game in which the Atlanta Falcons were playing the Chicago Bears given that Rome Flynn, who plays Bobby Colemanís rival, the hotshot young quarterback Anderson Fisher, grew up in Chicago.

Flynn told CNN that unlike their characters, he and Hardwick had no competition between them as leading men.

ìItís all love,î he said smiling. ìWe respect each other and we brought out the best in each other.î

"In†'Wednesday,'†Jenna†Ortega†makes†Netflix's†Addams†Family†series†look†like†a†snap","Although the main characterís name was inspired by the poetic line ìWednesdayís child is full of woe,î ìWednesdayî is generally a delight, thanks almost entirely to Jenna Ortega. Having outgrown her Disney Channel days, Ortega makes the Addams Familyís now-high-school-age daughter the coolest humorless goth sociopath youíll ever meet, in a Netflix series thatís more kooky than spooky or ooky.

Director Tim Burton sets just the right visual tone ñ a mix of the comedic and macabre that resembles ìEdward Scissorhandsî ñ while teaming up with ìSmallvilleî producers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, who know something about building a TV show around an extraordinary teen. Indeed, when Wednesday gets enrolled in a new private school, Nevermore Academy, she tells the headmistress (ìGame of Thronesíî Gwendoline Christie) about her frequent moves from school to school, ìThey havenít built one strong enough to hold me.î

That might change at Nevermore, a Poe-etic name for this haven for the weird and witchy, with a supernatural vibe thatís as much Hogwarts (or X-Men) as Charles Addamsí signature comic strip.


Not only does Wednesday have to deal with dawning psychic abilities and the strange visions that go with them, but a mystery emerges that turns the suspicious lass into an ill-tempered, ebon-clad Nancy Drew, trying to ascertain whoís responsible as the clues begin to circle back to her own family tree.

Itís obviously a fairly derivative mashup of genre elements, but the mix works in part because even the smaller ingredients are tasty, from Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzman as Wednesdayís parents, Morticia and Gomez, to her sidekick Thing, who obtains a dress she wants by employing ñ what else? ñ a ìfive-fingered discount.î The writers extract a great deal of comedic mileage from that extremity, so give them a hand.

What separates ìWednesdayî from similar efforts (Netflixís ìThe Chilling Adventures of Sabrinaî comes to mind), ultimately, is Ortega, who somehow manages to be relentlessly strange, a portrait in unblinking intensity and oddly endearing all at once. When the character description includes never raising oneís voice or cracking even the hint of a smile, thatís no small feat.

Throw in nifty touches like having Christina Ricci, who played Wednesday in the 1990s movies, as part of the school staff, and the local sheriff (Jamie McShane) dismissing Wednesday and her classmates as ìthe Scooby gang,î and the series operates on multiple levels.

Perhaps inevitably, ìWednesdayî canít sustain its initial kick as the serialized story unfolds over eight episodes, and the ending becomes too chaotic. Then again, thatís hardly a surprise given the nature of source material designed more for little jokes than a big sweeping story.

'Glass†Onion'†sharpens†the†'Knives†Out'†formula†in†a†polished†Netflix†sequel,"Rising to the challenge of matching its successful predecessor, ìGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mysteryî maintains the razor-sharp formula, with a setup that feels even more conspicuously like an Agatha Christie homage before an extremely clever series of twists kick in. Writer-director Rian Johnson again assembles a solid cast behind Daniel Craig, but itís his use of language ñ where nary a word is wasted ñ that finally gives the sequel its edge.

Netflix opportunistically stepped up to acquire the ìKnives Outî franchise and, departing from its usual ìStroke the filmmakersí egosî approach to theatrical distribution, will actually give the movie a wide one-week-only release before it hits the streaming service in late December. Most people will probably still wait to consume it in the comfort of their homes, but for those who do take the plunge, it certainly plays well with an appreciative audience.

After the family dynamics in ìKnives Out,î which gave everyone a motive to kill off the patriarch, Johnson tries his hand in a different setting, with an eccentric billionaire, Miles Bron (Edward Norton), inviting his old posse of pals to a murder-mystery getaway (during Covid, no less) on his secluded Greek isle, where theyíll be tasked with solving his ìmurder.î


The game, however, takes an unexpected turn, starting with the invitation to Craigís master detective Benoit Blanc, who remains brilliant and odd in near-equal measure.

As for the eclectic roster of guests/potential killers (and/or victims), they include a fashion designer/social-media loose cannon (Kate Hudson) and her partner (Jessica Henwick), a fitness influencer (Dave Bautista) and his girlfriend/sidekick (Madelyn Cline), a scientist (Leslie Odom Jr.), a politician (Kathryn Hahn), and most intriguingly, Milesí estranged former business partner (Janelle Mon·e).

Although the latest movie obviously lacks the sense of discovery that greeted the original ñ and even turned Chris Evansí sweater into a must-have item (Chris Evans not included), Johnson is smart enough to recognize that while this is about reloading, not reinventing, the change in venues can still refresh the formula.

Craig, moreover, is clearly having a ball with this new signature role, trading in his tuxedos and physicality for a more cerebral form of crimefighting, with a Hercule Poirot-like gift for eavesdropping and a Foghorn Leghorn Southern twang.

'Love†Actually'†cast†to†reunite†for†20th†anniversary†TV†special," 
One of the most beloved modern Christmas classics is turning 20 next year, and to mark the occasion, cast members from the landmark 2003 romantic comedy ìLove Actuallyî are reuniting for a TV special to air on ABC next week, the network announced Tuesday.

Hugh Grant, Laura Linney, Emma Thompson, Bill Nighy and Thomas Brodie-Sangster are taking part in the special, along with the filmís writer-director Richard Curtis.

In a promotional clip shared by ABC program ì20/20î on Twitter, Diane Sawyer asks the cast to fill in the sentence, ìLove actually isÖ,î to which Grant drolly answers, ìDead!î


According to ABC, the special will look at how the film successfully corralled a diverse ensemble to create a charming and winsome film examining various loving relationships during a frantic month leading up to Christmas in London, England, going on to become a beloved holiday tradition around the world.

The program, which comes a little early, considering the film was released on November 6, 2003, will also look at how the COVID-19 pandemic changed the ways people interact, love and connect, and the all-important need for kindness in families and communities.

The new reunion is not the first time the actors from ìLove Actuallyî ñ who also include Keira Knightley, Liam Neeson and Colin Firth ñ have come together again.


In 2017, a short sequel to the film was produced for NBC in honor of Red Nose Day, a charity for children in need created by Curtis.

James†Cameron†almost†didn't†choose†Leonardo†DiCaprio†or†Kate†Winslet†to†star†in†'Titanic',"James Cameron is sharing some surprising details from the making of his blockbuster hit ìTitanic,î which celebrates 25 years of being released next month.

In a new video interview with GQ, the iconic director revealed that he almost didnít end up casting Leonardo DiCaprio or Kate Winslet ñ his two romantic leads whose careers as major Hollywood movie stars were cemented by the landmark Oscar-winning film.

While considering actors to play the roles of his star-crossed lovers on the doomed ocean liner, Cameron explained that he was initially thinking of someone like Gwyneth Paltrow for Rose, and that while Winslet had been proposed as an option, he was afraid she was too much of a typecast.

ìI actually didnít see Kate at first,î he said in the video. ìShe had done a couple of other historical dramas as well, and she was getting a reputation as ëCorset Kateí doing historical stuff.î (It is true that ìThe Readerî actressís three credits prior to ìTitanicî were also period costume dramas ñ ìSense and Sensibilityî in 1995, followed by ìJudeî and ìHamletî one year later.)

Cameron went on to say that he was afraid that putting Winslet in the role ìwas going to look like the laziest casting in the world,î but that he nonetheless agreed to meet her in the end. Of course, he thought she was ìfantastic,î and the rest is history.

With DiCaprio, meanwhile, there were some initial hiccups.

After an initial ìhystericalî meeting with the heartthrob actor, in which all the women in the production office somehow ended up in the conference room alongside Cameron, DiCaprio was invited back for a screen test with Winslet, who had already been cast at that point.

But when the ìRomeo + Julietî star came in, he was surprised to learn heíd have to read lines and be filmed alongside Winslet to gauge their chemistry on camera.

ìHe came in, he thought it was another meeting to meet Kate,î Cameron described.

He remembered telling the pair, ìWeíll just run some lines, and Iíll video it.î

But then DiCaprio ñ who by then had led several movies and scored an Oscar nomination for 1993ís ìWhatís Eating Gilbert Grapeî ñ informed Cameron, ìYou mean Iím reading?ÖI donít read,î meaning that he no longer submitted to having to audition for film roles.

Without missing a beat, Cameron extended his hand to the star and and told him, ìWell, thanks for coming by.î

The director then explained to DiCaprio the enormity of the project before them, how the film was going to take two years out of his life, and how he was ìnot going to f**k it up by making the wrong decision in casting.î

ìSo youíre going to read or youíre not going to get the part,î Cameron said he told the young actor.

DiCaprio reluctantly submitted, to his credit.

Cameron remembered how the actor ìlit upî and ìbecame Jack,î creating electric chemistry with Winslet later seen plainly in the film itself.

ìTitanicî sailed into theaters on December 19, 1997 and eventually went on to win 11 Academy Awards, including best director for Cameron.

Morgan†Wallen†says†he†was†just†ready†to†go†home†while†addressing†abrupt†exit†on†SNL,"Morgan Wallen has no bad blood with ìSaturday Night Liveî after his abrupt exit at the end of a March episode sparked speculation online.

The ìLast Nightî singer addressed the moment while appearing on an episode of ìSundae Conversation with Caleb Pressleyî on Sunday, giving a simple explanation as to why it appeared he was so quick to leave the show.

ìI was ready to go home,î Wallen added. ìI had been there all week.î


Wallen was the musical guest on the March 29 episode of ìSNLî and confused some viewers at the time when he suddenly left the stage during the showís credits, where the cast and guests traditionally linger and hug each other. After giving the episodeís host Mikey Madison a brief hug, Wallen walked off the stage toward the side of the camera without acknowledging any of the showís cast members.

That same night, shortly after his departure, Wallen posted a photo of a plane on a runway with text across it that read, ìGet me to Godís countryî on his Instagram Story.

The post caused speculation about his experience, which spawned an internet reaction as well as an amusing mention in the following weekís ìWeekend Updateî segment of the show.


A source familiar with the situation previously told CNN that the country singer used the same path to enter and exit the studio as he had all week during rehearsals, and simply walked that same way after hugging Madison.

After the episode, longtime ìSNLî cast member Kenan Thompson told Entertainment Weekly in an interview that Wallenís exit was not ìthe norm.î

ìIt just felt so abrupt,î Thompson said. ìAnd it was already such a small grouping on the stage anyway. So it was just like, oh wow, that was pretty visible.î

Cecily†Strong†and†Colin†Jost†make†surprise†cameos†in††cold†open,"Things started off warmly enough on this weekendís episode of ìSaturday Night Liveî but then took a turn.

Cast members Kenan Thompson, Marcello Hernandez and Bowen Yang appeared in the cold open for a heartfelt tribute to their moms ahead of Motherís Day, but the moment was cut short when James Austin Johnson as Donald Trump showed up and sent them all packing.

He began his bit by talking about the newly elected Pope Leo XIV and joking about the 69-year-oldís hometown saying, ìWe have an American pope ñ Chicago-style. No ketchup.î

ìWe like Pope Leo. We hope he doesÖ what we want,î Johnson as Trump continued, adding, ìotherwise Iíll have to send JD back to do his thing.î The joke was a reference to the vice presidentís visit to the Vatican shortly before the death of Pope Francis last month.

He continued to discuss the pope and the Catholic Church, saying, ìWe love Catholic ñ itís one of the stronger Christian organizations, along with Salvation Army and, I wanna say, Chick-fil-A.î

Soon, he was joined on stage by ìSNLî alum Cecily Strong as Jeanine Pirro, who was appointed interim US attorney for Washington, DC this week. Strong frequently portrayed Pirro during her time on the show.

Strong as Pirro came out with a large black bag, which she joked was ìa cozy for my Merlot-zy,î removing a bottle of red wine from the bag for good measure.

Johnson as Trump said what he liked about Pirro, observing that ìsheís a great legal mind, and she has the most important quality I look for in a lawyer: sheís on TV.î

ìYouíre very very tough,î he later added.

ìÖEspecially on immigration,î Strong as Pirro replied. ìI donít have any reservations about sending things back. My friends know I have sent back every salad Iíve ever ordered at a restaurant.î

ìWouldnít know. Iíve never eaten one,î Johnson as Trump said.

The sketch ended with an appearance by current ìSNLî cast member and ìWeekend Updateî anchor Colin Jost, who portrayed Pete Hegseth.

The episode was hosted by ìWhite Lotusî star Walton Goggins, with musical guest Arcade Fire.

ìSNLî airs Saturdays on NBC at 11:30 p.m. ET/8:30 p.m. PT.

Alan†Alda†had†a†truly†heartfelt†moment†with†Tina†Fey†at†Netflixs†Four†Seasons premiere," 
Alan Alda approves of Netflixís new TV series reboot of ìThe Four Seasons,î which is inspired by his 1981 classic movie of the same name.

Alda made this clear when he visited Tina Fey, who created, wrote, executive produced and stars in the new series, and her co-showrunners Tracey Wigfield and Lang Fisher during the New York City premiere Saturday night and made an impromptu speech.

ìI just wanted to tell Tina in front of as many people as I can how beautiful the job is that she did on this series,î Alda said to a room full of rousing applause.


He continued: ìFor somebody as talented and knowledgeable and skilled as Tina is, to make an adaptation of something that meant so much to me, this movie all those years ago, to see her turn it into something for today, only she could have done it with her partners and her team and it makes me so happy to be honored by her like this.î

Fey, clearly moved, knelt down to give the Hollywood legend a kiss on the cheek as thanks for his kind words.

ìAlan, you stole my thunder,î Fey joked after Alda sat back down. ìReally, I was about to say that it cannot be overstated what an absolute icon and influence you are.î


ìThe Four Seasonsî is a romantic comedy that follows three married couples across spring, summer, fall and winter as they navigate the ups and downs in their relationships. The original film stars Alda, Rita Moreno and Carol Burnett, and was written and directed by Alda.

Feyís TV comedy reboot follows a group of longtime friends over four vacations and stars Fey, Colman Domingo, Will Forte and Steve Carell.

Bowen†Yang†feels†very†bleeping†strongly†that†òSNL†should†be†able†to†use†profanity†for†comic†effect,"
Bowen Yang is pleading his case for why he thinks he and his ìSaturday Night Liveî castmates should be able to use profanity on the sketch show.

Yang spoke his mind on Wednesdayís episode of his podcast ìLas Culturistas,î which he cohosts with Matt Rogers, telling Rogers and their guest Amy Poehler that he thinks the cast should be able to buck Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules and use certain swear words on live television throughout the season.

ìWe should be able to say at least five sós and five fós on ëSNLí per season,î Yang said, adding that he feels ìso hampered in our comedy at ëSNLí by not being able to sayî those two words in sketches.


Yang argued that ìSNLî should get an exception from the FCC, a federal organization that prohibits the use of profanity from being broadcast on TV.

ìIt would bring a sketch to the next level,î he said. The ìWedding Banquetî star added that he feels só and fó ìare so comedically powerful as words, I really think it would help us.î

Rogers asked Yang if the FCC ìcame downî on ìSNLî after profanity was used during the April 6 episode, albeit unplanned.

In the sketch, ìSNLî castmember Ego Nwodim did a bit on ìWeekend Updateî where she lobbied to be the White House Correspondents Dinner eventís comedic host by showing off her standup comedy chops.

Nwodim, appearing as her standup persona ìMiss Eggy,î issued a call and response to the audience at one point when she asked, ìbecause men ainít what?î and held her mic out toward the audience, who responded by saying ìsóî ñ much to Nwodim, and ìWeekend Updateî anchors Colin Jost and Michael Cheís, surprise.

ìWeíre gonna get fined for that,î Nwodim quipped in the skit.

As it turns out, nothing ever came of it, at least as far as Yang is aware. ìI donít think anything came down, which I love,î he shared on his podcast this week.

Wicked†live†musical†special†coming†to†NBC†with†Cynthia†Erivo†and†Ariana†Grande,"ìWickedî the film was so popular that a special is coming to the small screen.

The movieís director Jon M. Chu reportedly made the announcement Monday during NBCUniversalís upfront presentation, held at Radio City Music Hall in New York City.

Calling the special ìsomething thatís never been done in the 22-year history of ëWicked,íî Chu said, according to Variety, that it would feature stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande performing live songs from the first movie ìand maybe a little bit from the second one as well.î


Other ìWickedî cast members and ìsurprise guestsî are also expected to take part in the ìnight of entertainment that we think will be, as they say in Oz, thrillifying,î Chu said, per the publication.

ìWicked,î released last year, featured Erivo as Elphaba and Grande as Glinda.

A poster for the special shared by the social media accounts for the movie states that the special is scheduled to air on NBC and stream on Peacock this fall.

The ìWickedî film was a huge box office success and earned Erivo and Grande nominations for Academy Awards.

During the upfront presentation on Monday, Chu also shared with those in attendance a sneak peek of the unreleased trailer for the sequel titled ìWicked: For Good,î which is scheduled to be released in November 2025.",12-May-25,Entertainment,Lisa†Respers†France,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/12/entertainment/wicked-special-cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande-nbc,,,,,,,,,,,,‚Äúwicked‚Äù film popular special coming small screen movie‚Äôs director jon m chu reportedly made announcement monday nbcuniversal‚Äôs upfront presentation held radio city music hall new york city calling special ‚Äúsomething that‚Äôs never done year history ‚Äòwicked‚Äô‚Äù chu said according variety feature stars cynthia erivo ariana grande performing live songs first movie ‚Äúand maybe little bit second one well‚Äù ‚Äúwicked‚Äù cast members ‚Äúsurprise guests‚Äù also expected take part ‚Äúnight entertainment think say oz thrillifying‚Äù chu said per publication ‚Äúwicked‚Äù released last year featured erivo elphaba grande glinda poster special shared social media accounts movie states special scheduled air nbc stream peacock fall ‚Äúwicked‚Äù film huge box office success earned erivo grande nominations academy awards upfront presentation monday chu also shared attendance sneak peek unreleased trailer sequel titled ‚Äúwicked good‚Äù scheduled released november
Shonda†Rhimes†jokes†she†was†terrified†of†Ellen†Pompeo†after†the†actress†was†cast†on†Greys†Anatomy,"Shonda Rhimes knows her friend and ìGreyís Anatomyî star Ellen Pompeo is always going to give her the truth, plain and simple.

Itís why Rhimes lovingly admitted on Tuesday during her speech at Pompeoís Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony that when she met the actress two decades ago during a lunch meeting, she was ìa little bit terrifiedî of her.

ìAfter that lunch I went home and I literally wrote in my journal ñ I actually looked it up ñ ëThis girl is a spitfire, she will lay you out with the truth, up, down and sideways,íî Rhimes said. ìI was absolutely thrilled and a little bit terrified because itís rare to meet somebody like her.î


Rhimes went on to say that ìvery few people actually are who they present themselves to be but Ellen is exactly who she says she is, and youíre one of a kind.î

Pompeo and Rhimes go as far back as at least 2005 when ìGreyís Anatomyî first debuted on ABC. The network drama follows the life of Meredith Grey, played by Pompeo, a surgeon at the fictional Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital.

The series is currently in its 21st season with Pompeo still leading the charge as the titular character. It is the longest-running medical drama on television, beating out ìER,î which ran from 1994 to 2009.


Rhimes spoke on Tuesday about how even though as the showrunner and writer she created the character of Meredith Grey, Pompeo ìisî her but, she added, îsheís best when sheís simply herself.î

ìSheís fierce and funny and thoughtful and caring. Sheís a businesswoman, a talented actor, a kind friend and a great mom,î she said. ìAnd I donít care who you are, even if youíre the most powerful showrunner in TV, if you step out of line Ellen will tell you about yourself!î

Pompeo ìlives and breathes in the truth,î Rhimes said, ìand itís come to be my favorite thing.î

Emily†in†Paris†series†regular†Camille†Razat†confirms†her†decision†to†step†away†from†the†show,"ìEmily in Parisî is saying au revoir ñ or ciao ñ to one cast member that has been part of the Netflix series since the beginning.

Camille Razat, who plays Emilyís (Lily Collins) frenemy of the same first name, will not be returning for Season 5, according to a cast announcement published on Netflixís Tudum on Thursday. Razat has been a series regular for the past four seasons playing Gabrielís (Lucas Bravo) on-again-off-again romantic partner.

Razat confirmed the news on Instagram this week, writing that sheís ìmade the decision to step away from Emily in Paris.î


ìIt has been a truly wonderful experience, one filled with growth, creativity, and unforgettable memories,î she added. ìThis character has meant a lot to me, and I feel that her storyline has naturally come to an end. It felt like the right moment to explore new horizons.î

Among the cast members who are returning are Collins, Bravo, Ashley Park, Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu and Lucien Laviscount. Emilyís new Italian love interest Marcello, played by Eugenio Franceschini, will also be back.

Bravoís return to the series comes after the actor previously spoke out about his displeasure with his characterís arc, telling IndieWire in an interview last year that he was questioning if he wanted ìto be part of Season 5.î


Netflix also announced that the series will start production on Season 5 in May, filming in Rome before heading back to Paris later this summer.

Season 4 ended with Emily being tasked with opening up a Roman branch of Agence Grateau.

Of course, her love interest Marcello will be part of that story, further complicating her already complex romantic relationship with Gabriel as they work toward his restaurant earning a Michelin star.

ìMarcello is a whole other adventure that we want for Emily because we ultimately want Emily to be able to have a better work/life balance,î star Collins told Tudum. ìWe want to have Emily be able to smile without condition. We want to see her beyond her vacay mode. And he comes at that perfect time.î

A release date for Season 5 has not yet been announced.

This story has been updated to reflect Razatís statement posted to social media on April 23.

Razat confirmed the news on Instagram this week, writing that sheís ìmade the decision to step away from Emily in Paris.î


ìIt has been a truly wonderful experience, one filled with growth, creativity, and unforgettable memories,î she added. ìThis character has meant a lot to me, and I feel that her storyline has naturally come to an end. It felt like the right moment to explore new horizons.î

Among the cast members who are returning are Collins, Bravo, Ashley Park, Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu and Lucien Laviscount. Emilyís new Italian love interest Marcello, played by Eugenio Franceschini, will also be back.

Bravoís return to the series comes after the actor previously spoke out about his displeasure with his characterís arc, telling IndieWire in an interview last year that he was questioning if he wanted ìto be part of Season 5.î


Netflix also announced that the series will start production on Season 5 in May, filming in Rome before heading back to Paris later this summer.

Season 4 ended with Emily being tasked with opening up a Roman branch of Agence Grateau.

Of course, her love interest Marcello will be part of that story, further complicating her already complex romantic relationship with Gabriel as they work toward his restaurant earning a Michelin star.

ìMarcello is a whole other adventure that we want for Emily because we ultimately want Emily to be able to have a better work/life balance,î star Collins told Tudum. ìWe want to have Emily be able to smile without condition. We want to see her beyond her vacay mode. And he comes at that perfect time.î

A release date for Season 5 has not yet been announced.

This story has been updated to reflect Razatís statement posted to social media on April 23.

This†weeks†episode†of†The†Last†of†Us†absolutely†wrecked†us,"
If ìGame of Thronesî gave us the Battle of the Bastards, what shall we call the latest episode of ìThe Last of Usî? Perhaps, The One Where We All Cried For the Rest of Time.

The HBO dramaís recipe for heartbreak: Take safe zone Jackson, add a horde of hundreds of infected rising from the snow and smother it in game-changing tragedy. (Major spoiler ahead.)

In the episode, Abbyís (Kaitlyn Dever) search for Joel (Pedro Pascal) came to a climax as she tracked him down by sheer luck and slowly killed him, exactly as she had planned.

Hereís how things played out.

Abby and her crew finally made it to Jackson and set up camp at a cabin overlooking the town. But come daylight, they realized that the settlement was way more settled and sprawling than they expected. They had no real plan for how to get in or to find Joel.

Meanwhile, Abby went out to take watch and spotted two people on horseback, later revealed to be Joel and Dina, who had gone out early on patrol together. To get a closer look, Abby tumbled down the snowy hill and landed in a pit of infected, who at first glance appeared to be frozen underneath the snow.

Turns out, they werenít frozen at all. Hundreds arose from the snow and began to chase Abby. One almost caught her until Joel saved Abby from harm, bringing her to a barn where Dina (Isabela Merced) and their horses were.

Abby realized then that she found Joel after Dina said his name, and convinced them to bring her back to the cabin where she said her friends had supplies and could help them.

Once at the cabin, Abby revealed herself and her motive. Mel (Ariela Barer) gave Dina a shot in the arm that Abby said would make her sleep for an hour, but before Dina went lights out, she noticed a patch on one of their backpacks that read ìW.L.F.î ñ a clue about Abby and her crew that will likely come into play down the line.

Abby shot Joel in the knee to disable him and proceeded to tell him that he killed 18 soldiers and one doctor that day at the hospital. But that doctor, she said, was her father.

She said that thereís a code in the militia that sheís been with in Seattle for the past five years, that their commander trained them to not kill people who canít defend themselves. Joel, she pointed out, was in that position now with his knee shot out, but she said she was going to kill him anyway.

ìBecause it doesnít matter if you have a code like me or youíre a lawless piece s*** of like you,î Abby told Joel. ìThere are just some things everyone agrees are just f*** wrong.î

After Abby brutally beat Joel, Ellie (Bella Ramsey) happened upon the cabin and burst through the door to see Joel, nearly dead, lying bloodied on the ground. She was immediately restrained by Abbyís crew and sobbed for Joel on the floor, heartbreakingly screaming for him to ìget up.î

This is when Abby finished the job, stabbing Joel in the neck with a spear.

Ellie screamed that she would find them and kill them, which seemed to be setting up how the rest of this season will play out, before she crawled over to Joel and laid with him.

It was a devastating scene, punctuated by Jesse, Dina and Ellie later heading back toward Jackson on horseback, with Joelís body wrapped in a white cloth being dragged behind them.

Even more gut wrenching, earlier in the episode, Ellie told Jesse that even though there was tension with her and Joel, and even though they still hadnít really confronted each other about that tension, that ìIím still me, heís still Joel and nothingís ever going to change that.î

ìThis story is about how we all deal with those moments, which do confront us in life,î executive producer Craig Mazin said in a post-episode featurette.

Executive producer and creator Neil Druckmann also set the scene for whatís to come during the featurette, saying that parallels between Abby and Ellie both losing their dads are now becoming more clear.

ìThis event will change all the characters we know forever from this point on,î he ominously added.

ìThe Last of Usî airs Sundays at 9 p.m. EDT on HBO, with the episode available to stream on Max. HBO and Max, like CNN, are owned by the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.

Helen†Mirren†knows†something†about†playing†royalty.†Portraying†a†ruthless†crime†boss†was†a†seamless†next†step,"Dame Helen Mirren is known for her regal screen presence, having won an Oscar for playing Elizabeth II in 2006ís ìThe Queen,î just one of her celebrated portrayals of royalty or nobility.

It would seem as something of a departure, then, to see her in the new thriller crime series ìMobLandî ñ where she plays Maeve, the scheming and martini-swilling matriarch of a powerful London crime dynasty opposite Pierce Brosnan. But Mirren thinks Maeve fits quite well into her esteemed repertoire.

ìI think of all the characters Iíve played, the closest Iíve come to playing a character like Maeve was playing Lady Macbeth in a Scottish play many years ago,î Mirren said in a recent interview with CNN. ìShe has a lot of those qualities: profoundly ambitious, and ruthless, absolutely ruthless.î

ìI guess Elizabeth I (who she portrayed in the Emmy-winning 2005 miniseries), and probably Catherine the Great of Russia (who she played in a 2019 miniseries) may be sort of similar, but they were more restricted by their culture and their station,î Mirren added.

Co-directed by Guy Ritchie, ìMobLandî features Tom Hardy ñ who, along with Brosnan, was a major reason for Mirren to become involved ñ as the ìfixerî for the Harrigan family, cleaning up their many messes.

Mirren thoroughly enjoyed working on the show, which she called ìa dark soap opera.î Her character calls the shots, drink in hand, and knows the score before everybody else. Mirren isnít interested in the power play only, however.

ìWhat makes a character actually interesting is not their power, itís their vulnerability,î she shared, going on to openly wonder what, if any, vulnerability Maeve might exhibit. ìSheís a villain in a piece about villains. It will be interesting to see, ultimately hopefully, where Maeve goes.î

As for whether Mirren would consider taking on any royal roles again in the future, she said ìnever say never, but itís unlikely. I feel Iíve done all the really interesting ones.î (Another standout: her portrayal of Queen Charlotte in 1994ís ìThe Madness of King George.î)

ìIf something pops up that is really extremely different from what Iíve just done, then Iíll go for it,î she shared about her process of selecting roles. ìAnd if something pops up, it might be great, but itís very similar to something Iíve just done, Iíll usually step away from it.î

ìBecause I just love to constantly be upsetting my own cart, you know, and make life difficult for myself,î Mirren added with a queenly smile.

ìMobLandî premieres Sunday, March 30 on Paramount+.

"Ted†Lasso is,†believe†it†or†not,†coming†back†for†Season†4","All we had to do was believe.

AppleTV+ announced on Friday that the streamerís Emmy-winning comedy ìTed Lassoî is set to make its much-dreamt-about return with Season 4.

Jason Sudeikis, who serves as the titular character as well as an executive producer and co-show developer, will return to Richmond to reprise his role as the lovable UK-based football coach, according to a news release.


ìAs we all continue to live in a world where so many factors have conditioned us to ëlook before we leap, in season four, the folks at AFC Richmond learn to LEAP BEFORE THEY LOOK, discovering that wherever they land, itís exactly where theyíre meant to be,î Sudeikis said in a rather Lasso-like statement on Friday.

The full cast roster has yet to be announced, including whether beloved ìLassoî cast members Hannah Waddingham, Juno Temple, Phil Dunster, Jeremy Swift and Nick Mohammed, among others, will reprise their roles.

AppleTV+ did however confirm in the news release that Brendan Hunt and Brett Goldstein will return as executive producers, with Goldstein also continuing to serve as a cowriter on the series. The release did not specify whether they will also return as cast members Beard and Roy Kent, respectively.


Also on Friday, Sudeikis guested on the New Heights podcast hosted by Jason and Travis Kelce, where he teased a plot point for Season 4, saying that his titular character will be coaching a womenís team.

The news comes almost two years after the Season 3 finale episode of ìTed Lassoî aired. The episode at the time felt like a punctuation mark on the show, in spite of it not being officially billed as a ìseries finale,î leaving the showís future ambiguous.

ìTed Lassoî debuted in 2020 and instantly became a hit, eventually becoming one of AppleTV+ís most-streamed shows.

The comedy follows Lasso, an American college football coach who moves across the pond to serve as the coach of AFC Richmond, an English football team trying to come back from relegation. Lasso may not be the most skilled coach at UK football but, along the way, he injects his optimistic credos and sentimentality around every turn.

The feel-good show won 13 Emmys, including outstanding comedy series and lead actor for Sudeikis.

A release date for Season 4 has not yet been announced.

Jennifer†Aniston†cheekily†acknowledges†her†Easter†egg†cameo†on†The†Last†of†Us,"
Jennifer Aniston is just as charmed as the rest of us that a relic of her place in pop culture survived the fictional apocalypse in HBOís ìThe Last of Us.î

A 2003 issue of People magazine with Aniston on the cover was featured in the Season 2 debut episode of ìThe Last of Usî earlier this month, and the ìFriendsî actress winked at her cameo on her Instagram Stories on Tuesday.

ìOf all the things to survive the apocalypse,î Aniston wrote in text across a capture of her real-life magazine cover in the show.


Aniston also added a laughing emoji and tagged the official ìLast of Usî Instagram account.

The date of the magazineís cover also served as an easter egg of sorts as far as the timeline of the showís story goes, as the cordyceps pandemic first broke out in 2003, the same year that magazine issue was published.

Aniston has not personally appeared on the series, which is based on the popular video game of the same name.

The series stars Pedro Pascal, Bella Ramsey, Kaitlyn Dever, Isabela Merced, Young Mazino, Gabriel Luna and Catherine OíHara.

"Wink†Martindale,†beloved†host†of†game†shows†including†Tic-Tac-Dough,†dead†at†91"," 
Wink Martindale, a radio and television entertainer known to audiences as host of classic game shows including ìTic-Tac-Doughî and ìGambit,î has died. He was 91.

Martindaleís death was confirmed in a news release from his representative Brian Mayes, who also told CNN he was a family friend. Martindale died Tuesday in Rancho Mirage, California.

Born Winston Conrad Martindale in Jackson, Tennessee in 1933, he was transfixed from an early age by the family radio, eventually going on to succeed in the entertainment industry thanks to his talent, demeanor and that booming voice.

According to the news release, Martindale started his career as a disc jockey in Jackson at 17, but quickly ascended the ranks to eventually work at WHBQ in Memphis, where in July 1954 Elvis Presleyís first record ìThatís All Rightî was played on the radio for the very first time by a fellow DJ. Due to the immediate and overwhelming demand, the other DJ played the song again and again while Martindale telephoned Presleyís mother and asked if Presley could come down to the radio station. The music legend soon arrived at WHBQ for his first interview.

After this more than auspicious start, Martindale went on to a remarkable 74-year career, which included him finding gold-record success as a recording artist in his own right. His rendition of the spoken-word song ìDeck of Cardsî went to #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and #5 on the UK Singles Chart, selling more than one million copies in 1959. That same year, Martindale became the morning DJ at KHJ in Los Angeles, moving again a year later to the morning show at KRLA and finally to KFWB in 1962. He enjoyed lengthy stays at many other radio stations, including Gene Autryís KMPC from 1971-1979 and 1983-1987, the release said. Martindale is credited with having broken some of the biggest hits and artists of the 60s and 70s, spinning iconic songs for the first time on his radio shows.

Martindaleís additional radio credits include ìHit Parade Radioî and the syndicated programs ìMusic of Your Life,î ì100 Greatest Christmas Hits of All Time,î ìThe History of Rock ëní Roll,î and recent recurring appearances on ìThe Howard Stern Show.î

Alongside his radio and music pursuits, Martindale found success on television as well, ultimately becoming a perennial figure as a smiling and debonair game show host. His first break into TV was at WHBQ-TV in Memphis, as the host of ìMars Patrol,î a science-fiction themed childrenís television series, and then as host of ìTeenage Dance Party,î where his friend Presley made an appearance in June 1956. His first game-show hosting job came in the mid-1960ís, on NBCís ìWhatís This Song?î followed by NBCís ìWords and Music,î CBSí ìGambit,î and his biggest success, ìTic-Tac-Dough.î

Martindale also went on to host other popular game shows like ìHeadline Chasers,î ìHigh Rollers,î ìThe Last Word,î ìThe Great Getaway Game,î ìTrivial Pursuit,î ìDebt,î ìInstant Recall,î and many more. In recent years, he made appearances on programs including ìMost Outrageous Game Show Moments,î ìThe Chase,î and ìThe Bold and the Beautiful.î

In 1985, Martindale became a producer with the launch of the TV game show ìHeadline Chasers,î produced in association with Merv Griffin and syndication giant King World.

An avid philanthropist, Martindale supported various causes and produced and hosted annual telethons for Cerebral Palsy and St. Jude Childrenís Hospital, among many other charities.

In 2006, Martindale received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and in 2024, he was honored with a Beale Street Note on Memphis, Tennesseeís Beale Street Walk of Fame ñ not far from where in 2015, he was presented with the Distinguished Alumni Award by his alma mater, the University of Memphis, according to the news release. Martindale was also one of the first inductees into the American TV Game Show Hall of Fame.

At the time of his death, Martindale was surrounded by family and his wife of 49 years, Sandra Martindale, the release said.

Martindale is survived by his wife Sandra, sister Geraldine, his daughters Lisa, Lyn and Laura and a large extended family full of grandchildren and great grandchildren, his honorary son Eric and his beloved Chihuahua, Dude.

"Hacks†stars†and†creators†feel†they are†a†family†forged†in†fire†after†Covid,†Hollywood†strikes†and†LA†fires"," 
Themes like job loss, death, aging, family dysfunction and generational divide may not sound like comedy material, but the Emmy-winning series ìHacksî manages to find the laughs around lifeís roadblocks.

Ahead of the Season 4 premiere next week, star Jean Smart ñ who plays feisty comedienne-turned-late night host Deborah Vance on the series ñ talked about how that dichotomy is drawn from real life at a recent press conference.

ìWeíve all had that in our own lives. You know, tragedy and comedy. I mean, thatís just what life is,î she shared, emphasizing the value of being able ìto do that and to still have the tone of the show be essentially kind of fun and joyous.î


ìBut then the reality of, thereís always the flip side of the coin,î she added.

The cast and crew of ìHacksî were in production on Season 1 during the Covid pandemic, they navigated the dual strikes that hobbled Hollywood in 2023, and faced the wildfires that ravaged Los Angeles earlier this year.

ìI think we have been through a lot together,î the showís co-creator and costar Paul W. Downs said, pointing out that ìHacksî is ìa show that was made pre-vaccine.î

ìWe started out wearing two masks and a shield, and being six feet away from each other. And I think itís kind of like weíre forged in fire,î he continued. ìAnd I feel like what weíve experienced as a family, as ëHacksí family, has just made us closer. Itís just made the work better.î

ìI think every film and television show, they say is a miracle, and itís true,î Downs added. ìIt takes a huge community of people. But I think, weirdly, when youíre on a show or youíre on a set where you do have all of these hurdles, and you can see them tangibly, it just bonds you and brings you closer together.î

Downs plays Deborah and Avaís overwhelmed agent Jimmy in ìHacks.î Offscreen, he is married to series co-creator Lucia Aniello. (Jen Statsky is the third co-creator and writer on the series).

ìComedy and tragedy exists sometimes simultaneously in life,î Downs said. ìIt weirdly has reflected, I think, the tone of the show, the things weíve gone through because weíre making a comedy, but weíve been through, you know, pandemics and fires and deaths and all kinds of things.î

Wildfires are referenced in Season 4, which sees Deborah and company relocate from Las Vegas to Los Angeles in order for her to start hosting her late-night show. After an episode titled ìI Love LA,î a title card appears in tribute to the filming location used for Deborahís LA abode, a pink mansion built around 1930, according to Smart, that was destroyed in this yearís fires.

ìItís been sitting there and hasnít been touched by fire in 100 years almost. And it burned. And it was really sad,î Smart shared. ìWe had just, just finished shooting there, I think the week before or something? And to envision those beautiful rooms and that beautiful fountain and the back, the yard and the couple that lived there and their dog ñ I mean, theyíre safe, thank God ñ but yeah, that was shocking.î

Einbinder highlighted how these experiences have brought the show team closer, some of whom she said have known each other since high school.

ìWe have a crew that is such a cohesive group. And every department is so close and thereís so much love,î she said. ìWe have, as a collective ñ beyond just us on the stage ñ we have as a collective come together and really gotten close in a way that I am told is not really the industry standard, frankly.î

ìLike we all really go through it side by side. Itís really, really special to be a part of it,î she later added. ìTragedy, in the good times, throughout everything. Like we really have something special.î

?Smart echoed the sentiment.

ìI think that the crew is as proud of the show as we are, even though they donít get the accolades and the attention and the acknowledgment,î she observed. ìThe fact that they virtually ñ almost to a man ñ come back every season because they like being on our show is really heartwarming, flattering.î

James†Cameron†almost†didn't†choose†Leonardo†DiCaprio†or†Kate†Winslet†to†star†in†'Titanic',"
James Cameron is sharing some surprising details from the making of his blockbuster hit ìTitanic,î which celebrates 25 years of being released next month.

In a new video interview with GQ, the iconic director revealed that he almost didnít end up casting Leonardo DiCaprio or Kate Winslet ñ his two romantic leads whose careers as major Hollywood movie stars were cemented by the landmark Oscar-winning film.

While considering actors to play the roles of his star-crossed lovers on the doomed ocean liner, Cameron explained that he was initially thinking of someone like Gwyneth Paltrow for Rose, and that while Winslet had been proposed as an option, he was afraid she was too much of a typecast.


ìI actually didnít see Kate at first,î he said in the video. ìShe had done a couple of other historical dramas as well, and she was getting a reputation as ëCorset Kateí doing historical stuff.î (It is true that ìThe Readerî actressís three credits prior to ìTitanicî were also period costume dramas ñ ìSense and Sensibilityî in 1995, followed by ìJudeî and ìHamletî one year later.)

Cameron went on to say that he was afraid that putting Winslet in the role ìwas going to look like the laziest casting in the world,î but that he nonetheless agreed to meet her in the end. Of course, he thought she was ìfantastic,î and the rest is history.

With DiCaprio, meanwhile, there were some initial hiccups.

After an initial ìhystericalî meeting with the heartthrob actor, in which all the women in the production office somehow ended up in the conference room alongside Cameron, DiCaprio was invited back for a screen test with Winslet, who had already been cast at that point.

But when the ìRomeo + Julietî star came in, he was surprised to learn heíd have to read lines and be filmed alongside Winslet to gauge their chemistry on camera.

ìHe came in, he thought it was another meeting to meet Kate,î Cameron described.

He remembered telling the pair, ìWeíll just run some lines, and Iíll video it.î

But then DiCaprio ñ who by then had led several movies and scored an Oscar nomination for 1993ís ìWhatís Eating Gilbert Grapeî ñ informed Cameron, ìYou mean Iím reading?ÖI donít read,î meaning that he no longer submitted to having to audition for film roles.

Without missing a beat, Cameron extended his hand to the star and and told him, ìWell, thanks for coming by.î

The director then explained to DiCaprio the enormity of the project before them, how the film was going to take two years out of his life, and how he was ìnot going to f**k it up by making the wrong decision in casting.î

ìSo youíre going to read or youíre not going to get the part,î Cameron said he told the young actor.

DiCaprio reluctantly submitted, to his credit.

Cameron remembered how the actor ìlit upî and ìbecame Jack,î creating electric chemistry with Winslet later seen plainly in the film itself.

ìTitanicî sailed into theaters on December 19, 1997 and eventually went on to win 11 Academy Awards, including best director for Cameron.

Morgan Wallen says he was just ready to go home while addressing abrupt exit on SNL,"Morgan Wallen has no bad blood with ìSaturday Night Liveî after his abrupt exit at the end of a March episode sparked speculation online.

The ìLast Nightî singer addressed the moment while appearing on an episode of ìSundae Conversation with Caleb Pressleyî on Sunday, giving a simple explanation as to why it appeared he was so quick to leave the show.

ìI was ready to go home,î Wallen added. ìI had been there all week.î


Wallen was the musical guest on the March 29 episode of ìSNLî and confused some viewers at the time when he suddenly left the stage during the showís credits, where the cast and guests traditionally linger and hug each other. After giving the episodeís host Mikey Madison a brief hug, Wallen walked off the stage toward the side of the camera without acknowledging any of the showís cast members.

That same night, shortly after his departure, Wallen posted a photo of a plane on a runway with text across it that read, ìGet me to Godís countryî on his Instagram Story.

The post caused speculation about his experience, which spawned an internet reaction as well as an amusing mention in the following weekís ìWeekend Updateî segment of the show.


A source familiar with the situation previously told CNN that the country singer used the same path to enter and exit the studio as he had all week during rehearsals, and simply walked that same way after hugging Madison.

After the episode, longtime ìSNLî cast member Kenan Thompson told Entertainment Weekly in an interview that Wallenís exit was not ìthe norm.î

ìIt just felt so abrupt,î Thompson said. ìAnd it was already such a small grouping on the stage anyway. So it was just like, oh wow, that was pretty visible.î",12-May-25,Entertainment,Alli Rosenbloom,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/12/entertainment/morgan-wallen-addresses-snl-exit,,,,,,,,,,,,morgan wallen bad blood ‚Äúsaturday night live‚Äù abrupt exit end march episode sparked speculation online ‚Äúlast night‚Äù singer addressed moment appearing episode ‚Äúsundae conversation caleb pressley‚Äù sunday giving simple explanation appeared quick leave show ‚Äúi ready go home‚Äù wallen added ‚Äúi week‚Äù wallen musical guest march episode ‚Äúsnl‚Äù confused viewers time suddenly left stage show‚Äôs credits cast guests traditionally linger hug giving episode‚Äôs host mikey madison brief hug wallen walked stage toward side camera without acknowledging show‚Äôs cast members night shortly departure wallen posted photo plane runway text across read ‚Äúget god‚Äôs country‚Äù instagram story post caused speculation experience spawned internet reaction well amusing mention following week‚Äôs ‚Äúweekend update‚Äù segment show source familiar situation previously told cnn country singer used path enter exit studio week rehearsals simply walked way hugging madison episode longtime ‚Äúsnl‚Äù cast member kenan thompson told entertainment weekly interview wallen‚Äôs exit ‚Äúthe norm‚Äù ‚Äúit just felt abrupt‚Äù thompson said ‚Äúand already small grouping stage anyway just like oh wow pretty visible‚Äù
French actor Grard Depardieu found guilty of sexual assault,"A court in Paris on Tuesday found French actor GÈrard Depardieu guilty of sexually assaulting two women on a film set in 2021 and handed him an 18-month suspended prison sentence, in a fall from grace for a towering figure of French cinema.

In one of the highest-profile #MeToo cases to come before judges in France, Depardieu repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and his lawyer said he would appeal the courtís decision.

Depardieu, 76, was a towering figure in French cinema, starring in more than 200 films over five decades, including ìGreen Card,î ìThe Last Metroî and ìCyrano de Bergerac.î

His trial marked a moment of reckoning for the #MeToo protest movement over sexual violence, which has failed to gain the same traction in France as in the United States, although there are signs that social attitudes are changing.

One of the two plaintiffs, Amelie K, a set decorator now aged 54, told the court the actor had groped her all over her body as he trapped her between his legs and made explicit sexual comments on set in 2021.

ìI was terrified, he was laughing,î she recounted.

Depardieu, who denied sexual assault, had argued before the court that he did not consider placing a hand on a personís buttocks sexual assault and that some women were too easily shocked.

Handing down his sentence, the presiding judge, Thierry Donard, said of Depardieu: ìHe does not seem to have grasped either the concept of consent or the deleterious and traumatic consequences of his behaviour towards the women he assaulted.î

He ordered Depardieu, who was not in court for the verdict, to be put on a list of sex offenders.

#MeToo reckoning
Depardieu has figured prominently in the debate over the #MeToo movement in France, as he faced a growing number of sexual assault allegations that put a spotlight on how women are treated in the movie industry.

Prosecutors say he should face trial in a separate rape investigation, following allegations brought by actress Charlotte Arnould, 29, who said she could not bear remaining silent any longer.

More than a dozen women have accused Depardieu of sexual violence, though not all have filed complaints.

Depardieu has consistently denied wrongdoing. ìNever, absolutely never, have I abused a woman,î he wrote in an open letter in the daily Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023.

The Depardieu trial laid bare a generational divide in France over sexism.

Earlier during the investigation, a group of 50 French stars, including Carla Bruni, wife of former President Nicolas Sarkozy, denounced what they called the ìlynchingî of Depardieu.

Brigitte Bardot, 90, told BFM TV this week that ìthose who have talent and grope a girl get thrown into the gutter.î

Womenís rights campaigners say they have seen a shift in attitudes in France - notably following the case of Gisele Pelicot whose ex-husband was convicted last year of inviting dozens of men to rape her after drugging her unconscious.

ìItís truly a victory and a step forward. Weíre making progress,î Amelie K. told reporters after the verdict.

Tom Cruise gives Cannes another thrill with latest Mission: Impossible," 
Tom Cruise was last at Cannes in 2022, when the film festival gave him an honorary Palme díOr and, in return, got one of the last bona fide Hollywood stars to grace their red carpet as he launched ìTop Gun: Maverick.î

Fighter jets swooped overhead, and Cruise, who hadnít been to the festival in 30 years at that point, flashed that megawatt smile. Before you knew it, ìMaverickî soared past one billion dollars at the box office.

Which needed the other more ñ the festival or the star? It doesnít matter, the formula worked so well they commissioned a sequel to the whole spectacle.


On Wednesday night, Cruise ascended the steps of the Palais de Festivals once more for the gala premiere of ìMission: Impossible ñ The Final Reckoning.î As the cast assembled on the red carpet, an orchestra struck up a live rendition of Lalo Schifrinís theme tune, Cruise flashed that smile andÖ well, as Jerry Maguire once said, ìShow me the money.î

The film, which leans heavy on the franchiseís three-decade legacy, played well with the audience. Inside the Grand Theatre Lumiere, there was sporadic applause throughout for Cruiseís spy Ethan Hunt, series regulars Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames and newer recruits including Hayley Atwell.

Prolonged applause during the credits gave way to some words by director Christopher McQuarrie, who recalled being ìone of those kids who didnít quite fit inî when he was growing up.


ìA lot of my life was imaginative play. I got to grow up and have my very own action figure, who was actually willing to do just about any crazy thing I could think of,î he said, gesturing to Cruise.

ìIím grateful for your support, your friendship, your insanely unquestioning devotion to this craft, and most of all for your artistry,î McQuarrie, a four-time director in the ìMissionî franchise, added.

Cruise for his part noted McQuarrieís expansion of the franchiseís ambitions while looking forward to making ìa bunch of other kinds of moviesî with the director.

The comment further muddies the picture of whether this is the final ìMission: Impossibleî film. It was unclear from the filmís marketing if that were the case, and it remains unanswered even after watching all 165 minutes of the movie.

Shot in the UK, South Africa and Svalbard in the Arctic, ìFinal Reckoningî picks up where 2023ís ìDead Reckoningî left off, with Cruiseís Hunt pursuing the destruction of pervasive AI enemy The Entity. The stakes, already high, are ratcheted up significantly; arguably, Hunt and co. have never faced a graver scenario.

An exposition-heavy opening third, prone to repetition, offers a wobbly scaffolding on which Cruise and McQuarrie hang some truly spectacular set pieces. If the film spent less time worrying about explaining itself ñ or drifting into a reflective, sometimes somber mood ñ it might be more straightforward and more fun.

That said, when Cruise is firing all cylinders, in the well-advertised acrobatic biplane scene, and a nightmare-fuel deep sea diving sequence, heís a marvel to behold.

The actor has long been in a category of one when it comes to his on-screen pursuits, and this is no different. Itís no easy task for a director to keep up with Cruise, but McQuarrie does admirable and inventive work, and wisely lets the action do the talking when the film is at its best.

Despite the positive notices at Cannes, ìFinal Reckoningî will face stiffer headwinds than Cruise hanging off the side of an airplane to reach profitability. The film reportedly cost around $400 million, and studio Paramount will no doubt be nervous given ìDead Reckoningî relatively underperformed. The 2023 film, originally billed as ìDead Reckoning ñ Part One,î grossed $571 million worldwide ñ down from the franchiseís peak of $792 million for ìFalloutî in 2018 ñ although it was faced with the box office tidal wave of ìBarbenheimerî shortly after its release, something the latest movie has steered clear of.

Will ìFinal Reckoningî be a critical and commercial slam dunk like ìMaverickî? Paramount will care more than Cannes and more than McQuarrie. The festival got its star, and the director got to play with his action figure once more.

Shonda†Rhimes†jokes†she†was†terrified†of†Ellen†Pompeo†after†the†actress†was†cast†on†Greys†Anatomy,"Shonda Rhimes knows her friend and ìGreyís Anatomyî star Ellen Pompeo is always going to give her the truth, plain and simple.

Itís why Rhimes lovingly admitted on Tuesday during her speech at Pompeoís Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony that when she met the actress two decades ago during a lunch meeting, she was ìa little bit terrifiedî of her.

ìAfter that lunch I went home and I literally wrote in my journal ñ I actually looked it up ñ ëThis girl is a spitfire, she will lay you out with the truth, up, down and sideways,íî Rhimes said. ìI was absolutely thrilled and a little bit terrified because itís rare to meet somebody like her.î


Rhimes went on to say that ìvery few people actually are who they present themselves to be but Ellen is exactly who she says she is, and youíre one of a kind.î

Pompeo and Rhimes go as far back as at least 2005 when ìGreyís Anatomyî first debuted on ABC. The network drama follows the life of Meredith Grey, played by Pompeo, a surgeon at the fictional Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital.

The series is currently in its 21st season with Pompeo still leading the charge as the titular character. It is the longest-running medical drama on television, beating out ìER,î which ran from 1994 to 2009.

Rhimes spoke on Tuesday about how even though as the showrunner and writer she created the character of Meredith Grey, Pompeo ìisî her but, she added, îsheís best when sheís simply herself.î

ìSheís fierce and funny and thoughtful and caring. Sheís a businesswoman, a talented actor, a kind friend and a great mom,î she said. ìAnd I donít care who you are, even if youíre the most powerful showrunner in TV, if you step out of line Ellen will tell you about yourself!î

Bowen†Yang†feels†very†bleeping†strongly†that†SNL†should†be†able†to†use†profanity†for†comic†effect," 
Bowen Yang is pleading his case for why he thinks he and his ìSaturday Night Liveî castmates should be able to use profanity on the sketch show.

Yang spoke his mind on Wednesdayís episode of his podcast ìLas Culturistas,î which he cohosts with Matt Rogers, telling Rogers and their guest Amy Poehler that he thinks the cast should be able to buck Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules and use certain swear words on live television throughout the season.

ìWe should be able to say at least five sós and five fós on ëSNLí per season,î Yang said, adding that he feels ìso hampered in our comedy at ëSNLí by not being able to sayî those two words in sketches.


Yang argued that ìSNLî should get an exception from the FCC, a federal organization that prohibits the use of profanity from being broadcast on TV.

ìIt would bring a sketch to the next level,î he said. The ìWedding Banquetî star added that he feels só and fó ìare so comedically powerful as words, I really think it would help us.î

Rogers asked Yang if the FCC ìcame downî on ìSNLî after profanity was used during the April 6 episode, albeit unplanned.


In the sketch, ìSNLî castmember Ego Nwodim did a bit on ìWeekend Updateî where she lobbied to be the White House Correspondents Dinner eventís comedic host by showing off her standup comedy chops.

Nwodim, appearing as her standup persona ìMiss Eggy,î issued a call and response to the audience at one point when she asked, ìbecause men ainít what?î and held her mic out toward the audience, who responded by saying ìsóî ñ much to Nwodim, and ìWeekend Updateî anchors Colin Jost and Michael Cheís, surprise.

ìWeíre gonna get fined for that,î Nwodim quipped in the skit.

As it turns out, nothing ever came of it, at least as far as Yang is aware. ìI donít think anything came down, which I love,î he shared on his podcast this week.

Joe†Pesci†says†playing†Harry†in†the†'Home†Alone'†films†came†with†some†'serious'†pain," 
They say artists have to be willing to do anything for their art, and for Joe Pesci, that includes setting his head on fire.

In a new interview with People, the Oscar winner reflected on the making ìHome Alone 2: Lost in New Yorkî on the occasion of the sequelís 30th anniversary and remembered how the comedy required some physically ìdemandingî stunts on his part.

ìIt was a nice change of pace to do that particular type of slapstick comedy,î Pesci said of making the first two ìHome Aloneî films in the email interview, published on Tuesday.


In the uber-successful franchise, Pesci played one half a bungling thief duo (alongside Daniel Stern) who is continually one-upped by a clever kid played by Macaulay Culkin. He acknowledged that the movies ìwere a more physical type of comedy, therefore, a little more demanding.î

One example ñ when Pesciís character Harry walks unsuspectingly into a booby trap laid by Culkinís Kevin, leading to a fiery finish.

ìIn addition to the expected bumps, bruises, and general pains that you would associate with that particular type of physical humor, I did sustain serious burns to the top of my head during the scene where Harryís hat is set on fire,î the ìGoodfellasî star recalled.

In fact, Harryís head is set ablaze not once but twice in the movies, once in 1990ís ìHome Aloneî and again in the 1992 film, when Harry and Marv (Stern) chase Kevin through a house amid renovations. (Pesci did not clarify during which film he sustained his injury.)

Pesci added that he ìwas fortunate enough to have professional stuntmen do the real heavy stunts.î

ìHome Alone 2,î which hit theaters on November 20, 1992, welcomed back Pesci, Culkin and Stern along with Catherine OíHara and John Heard as Kevinís parents. The movie also starred Oscar-winning actress Brenda Fricker as the Pigeon Lady.

While promoting his forthcoming film ìEmancipation,î Smith called it ìa horrific nightî and said he ìlost itî when he stormed the stage and slapped presenter Chris Rock.

ìAnd I guess what I would say, you just never know what somebody is going through,î Smith said. ìI was going through something that night. Not that that justifies my behavior at all.î


Smith said that what was most painful to him was that his actions made it ìhard for other people.î

ìAnd itís like I understood the idea where they say hurt people hurt people,î he said.

ìThat was a rage that had been bottled for a really long time,î Smith said.


Noah pointed out how Smith had written in his memoir about growing up being afraid of conflict and the talk show host also noted the negative things that have been said about Smith and his family on the internet.

'Willow'†revives†the†Lucasfilm†fantasy†with†a†more†contemporary†streaming†adventure,"Disneyís press materials refer to the original 1988 movie ìWillowî as ìbeloved,î which despite its admirers feels like nostalgic inflation of a pretty generic George Lucas-plotted fantasy that provided an early directing showcase for Ron Howard. Setting that aside, a Disney+ revival series isnít without its charms, in a more contemporary narrative that brings back Warwick Davis while focusing on the next generation.

The series begins by recounting the events of the movie, which saw Davisí simple farmer Willow turn sorcerer and join in a fierce battle to protect a baby who carried the kingdomís destiny on her tiny shoulders, overcoming ancient evil with the help of the swordsman Madmartigan and (eventually) princess Sorsha. The latter were played by Val Kilmer and Joanne Whalley, respectively, who as an off-screen bonus got married after the film.

Kilmer, amid his struggle with cancer, remains out of the picture, but Whalley returns as the now-queen and mother of two headstrong grown children, who play roles in a mythical quest that requires journeying across treacherous lands to thwart the evil crone.

As for the aforementioned baby, Elora Danan, she has grown up in anonymity, ìSleeping Beautyî-like, to protect her, although her identity (a not-to-be-revealed spoiler) soon becomes known. The quest includes a colorful band with plenty of youthful relationship issues, including Princess Kit (Ruby Cruz), who is secretly in love with the knight charged with training her (Erin Kellyman, whose credits include Lucasfilmís ìSolo: A Star Wars Storyî); and Boorman (Amar Chadha-Patel), an irreverent brawler in the Madmartigan mode.

Jonathan Kasdan (who also worked on ìSoloî) serves as showrunner, collaborating with four directors who each oversaw back-to-back episodes. As constructed, ìWillowî draws upon the original while weaving in flourishes that recall the ìLord of the Ringsî movies, including lots of sweeping green countryside and abundant, occasionally quite-violent action.

As is so often the case with the growing subgenre of expanded-to-series sequels, this ìWillowî at times feels as if itís spinning its wheels, devoting lengthy stretches to Willow guiding the now-older Elora to master her powers, which he presents as the only hope of saving the kingdom. And while Kilmerís absence leaves a sizable hole Kasdan and company do a reasonably good job of filling it, including the late arrival of another knight (Christian Slater) with whom Madmartigan shared some history.


Beyond modern-sounding dialogue and situations, the story does exhibit plenty of playful irreverence and humor mixed in among the action sequences and elaborate fantasy production design. The latter in particular suggest that this revival was no small undertaking, and to its credit, it looks like that money ended up on the screen.

While that combination doesnít add up into making ìWillowî significantly worthier of the ìbelovedî label than its late-í80s predecessor, consumed on its own unpretentious terms, itís easy enough to like.

ìWillowî premieres November 30 on Disney+.

Kim†Kardashian†and†Kanye†West†reach†divorce†settlement,"Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have come to a divorce agreement, a source with knowledge of the negotiations tells CNN.

Per the agreement, a draft of which was obtained by CNN, Kardashian will receive $200,000 per month in child support from West, who last year legally changed his name to Ye, and share joint custody of their four children.

CNN has reached out to representatives for Kardashian and West for comment.

Kardashian filed for divorce from West in February 2021, citing irreconcilable differences.

The couple was married in a lavish wedding in Italy in 2014.

In March 2022, Kardashian was declared legally single after being granted a request to change her marital status.

In an interview with Vogue earlier this year, the Skims founder explained what led to her high-profile split, saying, that ìfor so long, I did what made other people happyî and that she decided ìIím going to make myself happy.î

She went on to say that ìeven if that created changes and caused my divorce, I think itís important to be honest with yourself about what really makes you happy.î

ìIíve chosen myself,î she told the publication. ìI think itís okay to choose you.î

In September, West, who in the latter part of this year has lost multiple business partnerships following a string of antisemitic comments, publicly apologized to Kardashian in an interview with ìGood Morning Americaî for ìany stressî heís caused her.

ìThis is the mother of my children, and I apologize for any stress that I have caused, even in my frustration because God calls me to be stronger,î West said.
